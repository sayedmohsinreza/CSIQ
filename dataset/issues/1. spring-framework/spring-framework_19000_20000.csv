One would use the public keyword for cacheable resources that are behind HTTP authentication -- a common case would be static javascript or image files that not accessible to general public. An even stronger case could be made for JSON/XML data intended for an AJAX client behind HTTP authentication that still wants to cache the response.  The private keyword is intended in cases where privacy of the cached data should be enforced -- for example for cached profile pages of the user.  These improvements would benefit applications that want comply with the recent trends in web site optimizations, such as the ones outlined in the best practices for caching section of Google's page speed project (http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html).  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  This issue is a sub-task of #16413  **Issue Links:** - #13194 Provide controller method level alternative to WebContentInterceptor - #15948 ServletWebRequest can't validate Etag and Last-Modified together.  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/38f32e38169f7779b9fe20d46b69024039f190ce  11 votes, 23 watchers","closed","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-23T23:58:34Z","2019-01-11T13:36:12Z"

"","11671","ProxyFactoryBean for intercept-methods can't predict type of bean to be created [SPR-7006]","**[Wouter Coekaerts](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=woutercoekaerts)** opened **[SPR-7006](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-7006?redirect=false)** and commented  When using the intercept-methods tag, a ProxyFactoryBean is created for which Spring can't predict the type of the bean that it will create (ProxyFactoryBean.getObjectType() is null).  That is a real problem because such beans are initialized at (to a non-spring-internals-expert) unpredictable and inappropriate moments in an attempt to determine their type. For example when autowiring another (totally unrelated) bean.  Attached is a simple test case reproducing this problem. If you put a breakpoint at the constructor of the AImpl class, you'll see it is initializing AImpl at that moment because it is looking for a ""C"" to autowire into ""b"". But (as seen in the stack at that point) AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.getTypeForFactoryBean(String, RootBeanDefinition) is in the case commented by ""No type found - fall back to full creation of the FactoryBean instance."", because getTypeForFactoryBean() on the ProxyFactoryBean created by Spring Security returned null. Spring Security should create a ProxyFactoryBean that properly declares the type it will return.  In the test case, this screws up the initialization order causing a NPE (which is then silently ignored), and if you uncomment the last part of the config xml, it goes entirely wrong. But that's (probably) another Spring bug, which is just triggered by this problem.  Anyways, even without this further failing, the totally changed initialization order because of some security interceptors can clearly not be intentional.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6  **Attachments:** - [autowire-issue.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16422/autowire-issue.zip) (_8.32 kB_) - [SecurityProxyFactoryBean.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16322/SecurityProxyFactoryBean.java) (_6.55 kB_) - [spring-security-init-test.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16278/spring-security-init-test.zip) (_5.33 kB_)  0 votes, 5 watchers","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-11T00:41:11Z","2019-01-13T21:46:39Z"

"","11668","bundle org.springframework.orm does not see package org.hibernate.cache in OSGi environment [SPR-7003]","**[Wolfgang Schell](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jetztgradnet)** opened **[SPR-7003](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-7003?redirect=false)** and commented  ## Problem description  I'm working on an OSGi plugin for Grails, which uses using Spring and Hibernate. Grails tries to create a Hibernate session with a HibernateTransactionManager, which fails with a `NoClassDefFoundException: org.hibernate.cache.CacheProvider`, because the Spring ORM bundle doesn't see package `org.hibernate.cache`, which is provided by the Hibernate bundle from [EBR](http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/).  I'm using bundles [`org.springframework.orm (3.0.1.RELEASE-A)`](http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/bundle/version/detail?name=org.springframework.orm&version=3.0.1.RELEASE-A) and [`com.springsource.org.hibernate (3.3.2.GA)`](http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/library/version/detail?name=org.hibernate.ejb&version=3.3.2.GA) from EBR with Equinox 3.5.1. When running with Equinox's trace option `org.eclipse.osgi/resolver/wiring = true`, the following statement can be seen in the OSGi console:  ``` ...         (w) [org.springframework.orm_3.0.1.RELEASE-A]:org.hibernate.cfg -> [com.springsource.org.hibernate_3.3.2.GA]:org.hibernate.cfg         (w) [org.springframework.orm_3.0.1.RELEASE-A]:org.hibernate.cache.access -> [com.springsource.org.hibernate_3.3.2.GA]:org.hibernate.cache.access         (w) [org.springframework.orm_3.0.1.RELEASE-A]:org.hibernate.cache -> OPTIONAL (could not be wired)         (w) [org.springframework.orm_3.0.1.RELEASE-A]:org.hibernate.annotations -> [com.springsource.org.hibernate_3.3.2.GA]:org.hibernate.annotations         (w) [org.springframework.orm_3.0.1.RELEASE-A]:org.hibernate -> [com.springsource.org.hibernate_3.3.2.GA]:org.hibernate ... ```  Please note the part `org.hibernate.cache -> OPTIONAL (could not be wired)`.  ## How to reproduce  I attached a zip file with a PAX Runner configuration, which reproduces the test environment. The configuration contains a profile with all required settings and a Equinox trace file, which enables tracing of package wiring.  After downloading Pax Runner from http://paxrunner.ops4j.org/display/paxrunner/Download and adding the bin directory to the `PATH`, the test can be run like this:  **Linux/Mac OSX**  ``` pax-run.sh --args=file:springdm-test.profile --log=debug ```  **Windows**  ``` pax-run.bat ""--args=file:hibcache-test.profile"" ""--log=debug"" ```  Please see http://paxrunner.ops4j.org/display/paxrunner/Using+proxies, when connecting to the Internet through a proxy (for download of dependencies from Maven repos).  The initial start may take some time, to download all required bundles from Maven repos (mostly from EBR).  After start up, the OSGi console prints many log messages, because of wiring trace options. When everything has settled down, the bundle list may be obtain with the command `ss`, which produces the list of bundles as seen below. When refreshing the Spring ORM bundle (which has **id 15** in the example below), the wiring message above can be seen on the console:  ``` osgi> refresh 15 ```  ## List of bundles  ``` id      State

This strikes me as an anti-feature; I don't think it makes sense to support a style of coding where the application breaks if debugging is disabled. I would suggest simply removing that capability and simply requiring the `@PathVariable` value to be explicitly set in all cases.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC3","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-02T17:14:21Z","2015-09-22T17:45:51Z"

For example, let's assume I have the following POJO:  ``` @XmlRootElement(""foo"") public class Foo {     private String messageText;    private Integer messageId;  ... //getters and setters skipped } ```  And I have the following controllers. First, a controller whose clients expect XML to be returned:  ``` @Controller public MyXmlController {  	@RequestMapping(value=""/{id}"", method=RequestMethod.GET) 	public @ResponseBody Foo getFooById(@PathVariable int id) { 		 		Foo foo = myService.getFooById(id); 		return foo; 	} } ```  and now a controller whose clients expect JSON back:  ``` @Controller public MyJsonController {  	@RequestMapping(value=""/{id}"", method=RequestMethod.GET) 	public @ResponseBody Foo getFooForUser(@PathVariable int id) { 		 		Foo foo = myService.getFooByUser(id); 		return foo; 	} } ```  Now in my servlet.xml file, I have the following to handle `@ResponseBody` marshalling:  ```                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ```  The limitation here is that, given a HTTP request with an ""Accept: *"" header (as is typical from most web browsers) the data from MyJsonController will always be returned as XML as the XML marshaller is the first listed messageConverter for the AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.  Is there a way I can specify a different ordered messageConverter list that the JsonController could reference?  I am aware of ContentNegotiatingViewResolver, however in my case the API paths are legacy and difficult to update.  It would be ideal if my controller could give a hint to the MessageConverter it prefers, or if it could have its own preferred list of MessageConverters   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=299622","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-18T02:54:43Z","2019-01-11T13:18:14Z"

The intercepter overrides the preHandle method of HandlerInterceptorAdapter.  My web controller methods use HttpMessageConverters to unmarshall request data for a `@RequestBody` parameter.  When I do not use the intercepter, the unmarshalling occurs properly and I receive a properly initialized POJO in my controller method.  However, when I do use the intercepter, the unmarshaller returns an uninitialized POJO.  Digging into the source code shows the ""inputMessage.getBody()"" call of the HttpMessageConverter returns an empty string.  My assumption is that the preHandle method of the intercepter parsed the input stream and thus the input stream is empty.  Ideally, the interceptor would not consume the input stream and leave it in the same state as it was before the intercepter was invoked.  Example:  Intercepter:  ```  public class RequestLoggerInterceptor extends HandlerInterceptorAdapter {          @Override 	public boolean preHandle( HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp, Object handler) throws Exception { 		String userId = req.getParameter(""userId""); 		String path = req.getServletPath();                 return true;         } } ```  Controller:  ``` @RequestMapping(value=""/{entryType}"" ,method=RequestMethod.POST) public void doProcessPOST(@PathVariable String entryType, @RequestBody EntryCommand command, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception {      processRequest(entryType, command, request, response);     }	 ```  Note that when the intercepter is disabled, I get a fully initialized command object.  With the intercepter, the command object is empty.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2","closed","status: invalid,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-10T11:17:42Z","2019-01-12T05:32:05Z"

"","11122","ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource should be searching for any matching ResourceBundle [SPR-6456]","**[Tor Anders Johansen](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=toralux)** opened **[SPR-6456](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6456?redirect=false)** and commented  The current implementation of ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource does only search for one matching ResourceBundle, the first found in the path specified by a basename, for every basename if several basenames is listed.  This is because of that the refreshProperties()-method calls the ResourceLoader-interfaces getResource()-method, even if an object implementing the ResourcePatternResolver-interface is available. (The ResourcePatternResolver-interface has a getResources()-method and will return all matching ResourceBundles, and has also other advantages as it support asterisk and double-asterisk for the basename as this example:  ```xml          classpath*:com/company/**/i18n     classpath*: i18n/i18n     ```  About the example: The first basename will search for i18n at any arbitrary location below the com/company, thus having more flexibility. The second basename will search for any i18n ResourceBundle found in a i18n-folder. Even if the solution is divided into modules / consists of several subprojects, any ResourceBundle from any of those modules will be will be loaded. This way it is easier to for instance maintain different translations for each module in the solution.  I have encountered threads discussing this limitation on the Spring forum: http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=57650 http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=80555  A proposed solution: The class ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource has a private member ""private ResourceLoader resourceLoader"".  Instead of always using the limited functionality of the ResourceLoader-interface, I suggest (and apply a patch) for using the more extended functionality of ResourcePatternResolver-interface if the injected object is actually implementing the ResourcePatternResolver-interface (which is a super-interface of the ResourceLoader-interface).

Manually editing the HTML to include the [ and ] characters in the ""name"" attribute fixes the issue.

My suggested solution would be to interpret a backslash in front of #{} or ${} as escapes, so that expressions with this prefix are not evaluated. The escaping backslash should be removed in the final result. If the backslash is part of the value, it needs to be escaped itself (\\).

Steps to reproduce:  download and extract: spring-framework-2.5.6.SEC01-with-dependencies.zip apache-tomcat-6.0.20.tar.gz  set up and configure the HSQL db  modify: war/WEB-INF/web.xml - change to use

Unfortunately the query proxy org.springframework.orm.jpa.SharedEntityManagerCreator.DeferredQueryInvocationHandler returns the internal Query object from the JPA implementation, so subsequent calls this query won't get through the proxy any more. As a consequence the EntityManager won't get closed after query execution (getResultList, getSingleResult or executeUpdate).  This results in memory and connection leaks, at least until timeouts occur.

We have an extension of this class that allows to re conciliate multiple persistence.xml in a single one on the fly. Here's the idea. Assume that we have defined an empty persistence unit called ""pu"" and that is used by our entity manager. Our extensions of the PersistenceUnitManager scans all persistence.xml and if it matches a certain condition (here if the unit name starts with 'pu') then it is re conciliated with our bootstrap persistence unit.  To do so, we use the getPersistenceUnitInfo(String name) of the class. Up to 3.0, it was returning `MutablePersistenceUnitInfo`. Is there any way to have a protected method that returns the mutable class?  Btw, this is similar to what is described in #7287 except that JPA does not allow two different persistence.xml with the same persistence unit name (Weblogic namely checks that when deploying an app).

The reason that is given in the code as to why the Jar file is not closed from a JarURLConnection is because the JarURLConnection ""might cache the file reference"".  However, ""setUseCaches(false)"" is called on the JarURLConnection instance when it is first obtained presumably because we do not want any caching done.  (And internally, at least for the Sun JVM version of the JarURLConnection subclass [sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection], if ""useCaches"" is ""false"", then the Jar file is closed after it is no longer needed [e.g., when the input stream from the JarURLConnection instance is closed].)  The net result of this is that the Jar file will NOT be closed for an undetermined length of time (until the Jar file's ""finalize()"" method is called by the GC), and in Windows, the Jar file will most likely have an open-file lock on it unnecessarily after this method completes.  The solution is to simply close the Jar file unconditionally at the end of the method.  (Curently, it is only closed when the ""newJarFile"" flag is set, which is not the case when the Jar file is retrieved from a JarURLConnection directly.)  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6  **Issue Links:** - #17521 Regression: DLL handled as classpath resource - #16711 PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver cannot search for ""classpath*"" patterns in a jar file roots - #18260 PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver does not consider manifest based classpaths - #18657 PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver should enforce consistent alphabetical sorting of directory content  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/4c964473b19590780b9ddad34c832f0b2b4f47d8  1 votes, 4 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-11-02T17:22:21Z","2019-01-11T14:25:14Z"

When methods on that connection are called it will invoke the TransactionAwareInvocationHandler connection proxy and call DataSourceUtils.doGetConnection() passing it the 'target' datasource - the one that is being wrapped. If transaction synchronization is active it will create a connection holder with the target datasource as the key for the bind resource on the thread.  Now in the same transaction some JdbcTemplate is invoked. The JdbcTemplate bean is configured to use the TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy datasource. The JdbcTempate execute call  will result in a direct call to DataSourceUtils.getConnection() using the Proxy and not the target. Since transaction synchronization is active in this case, this method will create an additional connection holder and bind it to the thread using the Proxy datasource. This results in two connection holder resources bound to the thread - one for the target and one for the Proxy. I believe they both end up pointing to the same physical database connection but I believe this can cause some bad side effects.  I noticed that during this tx commit, when DataSourceUtils.beforeCompletion() is called (due to synchronization being active), it closes the connection shared by both connection holders when it shouldn't. There's probably other bad side effects as well.  It seems like the DataSourceUtils.doGetConnection() should never bind a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy datasource to the thread but unwrap it and look to see if the target is bound to the thread and if not bind the target to the thread in the case of transaction synchronization being active. Diddo for the DataSourceUtils.doReleaseConnection().  Or when the datasource is a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy, Spring TX code should not call DataSourceUtils.getConnection() or doGetConnection() directly but call TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy.getConnection() instead.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1  0 votes, 6 watchers","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-04T08:46:04Z","2019-01-12T16:38:10Z"

This has knock on implications, most notably in this case in CallMetaDataProviderFactory, which uses the common database name to determine which meta data provider to use:  else if (""Sybase"".equals(databaseProductName)) { provider = new SybaseCallMetaDataProvider((databaseMetaData)); }  The net result of this is that a generic provider is used rather than a Sybase provider. The generic provider does not function correctly with at least one stored procedure in one of our applications, which results in no parameters being passed to the server.

One would have to include a custom option:  ```              ```  and in addition one needs to register a custom converter to handle the potential null value appropriately.  I think the option to allow a default null option is common enough for Spring MVC to offer it out of the box rather than requiring the developer to work around it.  Here is a suggested solution for it:  ```   ```  (Obviously the attribute name can be discussed). The presence of this attribute should then indicate for the select tag to include a null option with the label specified.  Furthermore it would be good if the current IdToEntityConveter could handle null values accordingly (http://maciej.inszy.org/2010/02/18/spring-3-mvc-and-optional-relationships/ discusses a solution).    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1  **Attachments:** - [select.tagx](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/17587/select.tagx) (_6.75 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - [ROO-581](https://jira.spring.io/browse/ROO-581) Create and update views don't allow nullable reference field to be null  (_**""is depended on by""**_)  21 votes, 15 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-29T15:32:25Z","2019-01-12T03:50:24Z"

Same for the nInStock field which needs to be uppercased (first letter) and nInStock would raise a NotReadablePropertyException).  This seems to be inconsistent w/r to the conventions used here. Why is title handled different to the other two? Also, why can't we allow a convention where title, iSBN and nInStock all work assuming that the get methods follow JavaBean conventions with correct accessors and mutators as shown above? The data binder would just uppercase the first letter of the form field and prepend get and set accordingly.

Since JPA 2.0.0, EntityManager has a dependency on javax.persistence.criteria.  Thus, a (optional) package import on javax.persistence.criteria must be added to the MANIFEST.MF of ORM bundle.  Otherwise, we get NoClassDefFoundError for class javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery, when using `@PersistenceContext` in OSGi environments.  Note: There are some cases, when this error not occurs, for example, if the EntityManagerFactory created in the same bundle as where `@PersistenceContext` is used and if this bundle has some import on javax.persistence.criteria. But in other cases, when EntityManagerFactory is provided as an OSGi-service and used by other (DAO-)Bundles, we have no chance to workaround the missin import, since in those cases, always the Bundle classloader of ORM is used:  108 if (emf instanceof EntityManagerFactoryInfo) { 109 	                        cl = ((EntityManagerFactoryInfo) emf).getBeanClassLoader(); 110 	                } 111 	                Class[] ifcs = new Class[entityManagerInterfaces.length + 1]; 112 	                System.arraycopy(entityManagerInterfaces, 0, ifcs, 0, entityManagerInterfaces.length); 113 	                ifcs[entityManagerInterfaces.length] = EntityManagerProxy.class; 114 	                return (EntityManager) Proxy.newProxyInstance( 115 	                                (cl != null ? cl : **SharedEntityManagerCreator.class.getClassLoader())**, 116 	                                ifcs, new SharedEntityManagerInvocationHandler(emf, properties));    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e328083d118670e9853d73ee04ffd139488543e8, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/2a19148eed5388e0d3e7daa3fe60fb22b4a411f0","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-04T20:04:09Z","2012-06-19T03:43:55Z"

It would be consistent with Spring's other validation (type conversion) messages and essential if you want to show a validation error summary (vs. showing the error message next to the input field in the UI, i.e. ""Foo must match [a-z]+"").  I have extended LocalValidatorFactoryBean and overridden validate(Object target, Errors errors) to include the field name (as a DefaultMessageSourceResolvable) as the first argument. But I think it should be included directly in LocalValidatorFactoryBean (i.e. SpringValidatorAdapter).  The code could look something like this (sorry, too lazy to make a patch :)      public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {         Set result = getValidator().validate(target);         for (ConstraintViolation violation : result) {             String field = violation.getPropertyPath().toString();             FieldError fieldError = errors.getFieldError(field);             if (fieldError == null || !fieldError.isBindingFailure()) {                 // build argument list...

When using declarative validation constraints with Spring, custom/localized messages should be able to access the arguments to the validation annotation in a consistent manner that is guaranteed to work across validator providers.  For example, when applying an annotation like ""`@Size`(min=1, max=25)"" to a field you should be able to provide an error message format like ""Size.fieldName=Size of {0} must be between {1} and {2}"".  Currently, the values of the arguments passed to the annotation are available to the message source in an arguments array, but the position of each value in the array is not consistent. It appears that the positions of the arguments in the array can change depending on the validator provider and potentially change between releases of a validator provider. If the framework does currently provide some guarantee of the order, then this should be documented.  Here are some examples of validator annotations and the arguments array that is available to the message source when the validation fails. In all cases the first ([0]) element in the array is a DefaultMessageSourceResolvable containing the name of the field in error.  `@Size`(min=1, max=25)  |index|contents| |:---|:---| |1|""message"" argument from annotation| |2|""min"" argument from annotation| |3|""payload"" argument from annotation| |4|""max"" attribute of annotation| |5|""groups"" attribute of annotation|  `@Max`(25)  |index|contents| |:---|:---| |1|""value"" argument from annotation| |2|""message"" argument from annotation| |3|""groups"" attribute of annotation| |4|""payload"" argument from annotation|  `@Min`(1)  |index|contents| |:---|:---| |1|""value"" argument from annotation| |2|""message"" argument from annotation| |3|""groups"" attribute of annotation| |4|""payload"" argument from annotation|  `@Pattern`(regexp=""[A-Z]+"")  |index|contents| |:---|:---| |1|""message"" argument from annotation| |2|""payload"" argument from annotation| |3|""flags"" argument from annotation| |4|""regexp"" attribute of annotation| |5|""groups"" attribute of annotation|  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=279199#post279199  **Attachments:** - [ConstraintsArgumentsMappings.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16780/ConstraintsArgumentsMappings.java) (_2.17 kB_) - [SpringValidatorAdapterWithGroups.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16779/SpringValidatorAdapterWithGroups.java) (_2.67 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #11966 Expose MessageSource through Hibernate Validator 4.1's ResourceBundleLocator  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7304c090213a38108f9f06cf1d2db3f9f754c621  3 votes, 9 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-20T05:07:30Z","2019-01-13T21:47:27Z"

One option that is supported by `@RequestMapping` methods but not `@ExceptionHandler` methods is returning naked bean objects from the exception handler method.  For example, this type of exception handler method would be very convenient, especially when building RESTful services using a MarshallingView (the important detail is the ""HelloResponse"" return value from the handleBindException method):  ``` @Controller @RequestMapping(""/Hello"") public class HelloController {   @RequestMapping(value = ""/greet"", method = RequestMethod.GET)   public HelloResponse greetGet(@Valid HelloRequest request) {     String message = ""Hello, "" + request.getTitle() + "" "" + request.getName();     return new HelloResponse(message);   }    @ExceptionHandler(BindException.class)   public HelloResponse handleBindException(BindException be) {     List errors = be.getFieldErrors();     HelloResponse response = new HelloResponse();     for (FieldError error : errors) {       response.addError(error.toString());     }     return response;   } } ```  With a response object that looks like this:  ``` @XmlRootElement(name = ""response"") public class HelloResponse {   private String message;   private List errors;   // getters and setters } ```  Currently this code will throw an exception when the exception handler method returns to the framework:  ``` java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid handler method return value: HelloResponse@caf0ed 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver.getModelAndView(AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver.java:353) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver.doResolveException(AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver.java:101) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.AbstractHandlerExceptionResolver.resolveException(AbstractHandlerExceptionResolver.java:109) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.processHandlerException(DispatcherServlet.java:1004) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doDispatch(DispatcherServlet.java:792) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doService(DispatcherServlet.java:716) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:647) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.doGet(FrameworkServlet.java:552) 	at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:707) 	at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:820) ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Attachments:** - [ExceptionHandler-return.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16092/ExceptionHandler-return.patch) (_5.70 kB_)  13 votes, 19 watchers","closed","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-14T01:57:19Z","2012-06-19T03:43:03Z"
"","11243","MarshallingView auto detect model with Jaxb2Marshaller chooses the wrong object [SPR-6577]","**[Scott Frederick](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=scottyfred)** opened **[SPR-6577](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6577?redirect=false)** and commented  When using MarshallingView with a Jaxb2Marshaller and more than one object in the model has JAXB annotations on it, automatic detection of the appropriate object in the model does not work as expected.  Using this example MVC RESTful service:  Request and Response classes:  ``` @XmlRootElement(name = ""request"") public class HelloRequest {   private String name;   private String title;   // getters and setters }  @XmlRootElement(name = ""response"") public class HelloResponse {   private String message;   // getters and setters } ```  Controller:  ``` @Controller @RequestMapping(""/Hello"") public class HelloController {   @RequestMapping(value = ""/greet"", method = RequestMethod.GET)   public HelloResponse greetGet(HelloRequest request) {     String message = ""Hello, "" + request.getTitle() + "" "" + request.getName();     return new HelloResponse(message);   } } ```  -servlet.xml  ```                                                                                                   ```  In this scenario, the Controller simply returns a response object. The model is automatically generated, and includes both the request and response objects (along with a few other objects). The model is passed to the MarshallingView, which tries to detect the appropriate model object for rendering the view (since no modelKey property was set on the MarshallingView). MarshallingView calls the supports() method of the configured Marshaller with each object in the model until supports() returns true. The detected object is then passed to the Marshaller for marshalling.  When MarshallingView is used with Jaxb2Marshaller this causes a problem. Jaxb2Marshaller.supports(Class c) will return true for any type that has a JAXB `@XmlRootElement` annotation on it, even if that Marshaller is not configured to support that class. In this scenario, MarshallingView encounters the request object in the model first and passes it to Jaxb2Marshaller.supports(), which returns true because the request object is annotated with `@XmlRootElement`. MarshallingView then passes the request object to Jaxb2Marshaller.marshal(). This call fails because the Marshaller is not configured to handle HelloRequest objects:  ``` org.springframework.oxm.UncategorizedMappingException: Unknown JAXB exception; nested exception is  javax.xml.bind.JAXBException: class com.test.domain.HelloRequest nor any of its super class is known to this context. 	at org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller.convertJaxbException(Jaxb2Marshaller.java:580) 	at org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller.marshal(Jaxb2Marshaller.java:412) 	at org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller.marshal(Jaxb2Marshaller.java:395) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.view.xml.MarshallingView.renderMergedOutputModel(MarshallingView.java:103) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.view.AbstractView.render(AbstractView.java:250) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.render(DispatcherServlet.java:1060) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doDispatch(DispatcherServlet.java:798) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doService(DispatcherServlet.java:716) 	at org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:647) 	... 37 more Caused by: javax.xml.bind.JAXBException: class com.test.domain.HelloRequest nor any of its super class is known to this context. 	at com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.JAXBContextImpl.getBeanInfo(JAXBContextImpl.java:554) 	at com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.XMLSerializer.childAsRoot(XMLSerializer.java:470) 	at com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.MarshallerImpl.write(MarshallerImpl.java:314) 	at com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.MarshallerImpl.marshal(MarshallerImpl.java:243) 	at org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller.marshal(Jaxb2Marshaller.java:408) 	... 44 more ```  If the Jaxb2Marshaller were configured to support HelloRequest objects, then this exception would not be thrown but the request object would incorrectly be marshalled to the output view instead of the response object.  To fix this, either the `@XmlRootElement` must be removed from the HelloRequest class, or the modelKey property must be set on the MarshallingView (to ""helloResponse"" in this case) to override automatic detection of the appropriate model object. Neither of these is a good solution. * The HelloRequest class does not need the `@XmlRootElement` annotation on it for this example, but in the real-world scenario this class is also used for other POST requests with the `@RequestBody` annotation. * Setting the modelKey property on the view would require a unique view bean to match each response object, since the name of the response object class is used to generate the model key.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/b1e2a2ec3c12e896824dfeb71f0e44b4a85c736f","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-17T05:55:26Z","2012-06-19T03:43:02Z"

The `@Required` annotation is too coarse grained to provide much support for validating APIs.  Using a combination of Assert.notNull (or other asserts) in an afterPropertiesSet is rather tedious.  Being able to annotation the collaborators with annotations such as `@NotNull`, etc. and then having them automatically validated when the container starts would be really useful.  We've actually implemented this for CAS, but I'd like to see it available in Spring if possible, as I know we would find it useful for multiple projects (and copying it to each project is probably not a good idea).  Our implementation is here: https://www.ja-sig.org/svn/cas3/trunk/cas-server-core/src/main/java/org/jasig/cas/util/ValidatorBeanPostProcessor.java  Its relatively trivial.  There might be improvements that could be made to it.

With the SimpleFormController hierarchy it was straightforward to override BaseCommandController's onBind() or onBindAndValidate() methods to achieve custom binding; however, with `@MVC` it is currently not possible. Neither the WebBindingInitializer API nor an `@InitBinder` method provides a mechanism to plug in custom binding.  Note that this was not an issue prior to support for `@Valid`, since without `@Valid` developers were responsible for executing validation code within a handler method.  One possible solution would be to add support for an `@PostBinding` method or `@PreValidation` method (or similar) which would be allowed to modify the model after binding but prior to executing the handler method.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC2  **Issue Links:** - #12449 Support for interception of controller method invocation after binding has completed (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #10091 Integrating validation into the `@MVC` request lifecycle - #11138 `@MVC` should provide a way to invoke custom code at preBind stage  6 votes, 6 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-11-24T07:48:59Z","2019-01-13T07:57:02Z"

We have beans that may specify meta element.  \ \ \  This meta element is processed by own PostProcessor, it's not really interesting why. The problem is that we would like to use placeholders inside the meta element as well. The current implementation of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer doesn't support it. So i decided to implement it by myself and it was a pain, because PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer isn't really well designed. I've implemented BeanDefinitionVisitor enhanced about visiting bean's attributes. But there is no way to inject this, let say strategy, into PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer. Therefore i've had to subclass  PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer, copy processProperties method from the super class and replace BeanDefinitionVisitor by my own implementation.    ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6  **Attachments:** - [EnhancedBeanDefinitionVisitor.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16317/EnhancedBeanDefinitionVisitor.java) (_1.35 kB_) - [EnhancedPropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16318/EnhancedPropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer.java) (_2.68 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-18T03:29:49Z","2012-06-19T09:36:27Z"

I implemented this and based on http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-6079 it should also work.

Something like this:  ``` /**  * Return the last task.  */ public TaskInfo getLastTask() throws IllegalStateException { 	if (this.lastTaskInfo == null) { 		throw new IllegalStateException(""No tasks run: can't get last task""); 	} 	return this.lastTaskInfo; } ```  Also, there's a typo in `getLastTaskName()`, presumably because `getLastTaskTimeMillis()` was copied. The exception message should read `""can't get last name""` instead of `""can't get last interval""`.  Finally, I imagine this has something to do with the original use of this code, but shouldn't the execption messages in both `getLastTaskName()` and `getLastTaskTimeMillis()` refer to `""tasks""` instead of `""tests""`?   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/ceb668ac6cba288b59b3d840679ab62308a647f6","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-26T02:29:12Z","2012-06-19T03:44:01Z"

The issue is that it does not behave like ""normal"" `@Configuration` instances: everytime the someDependency method is invoked, a new Dependency bean is created instead of re-using the singleton instance.  If we print the class name at runtime, we can see that it hasn't been enhanced by CGLIB.  It seems that because this `@Configuration` class is creating a BeanFactoryPostProcessor, the normal behaviour of `@Configuration` changes.

It tries to keep them in sorted order. That's nice and makes sense. BTW, this strategy is working fine also for HandlerMapping implementations.  The bad thing is that the default implementation of HandlerAdapter interface being used for the annotation driven context (AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter) doesn't support ordering. That makes some inconveniences for our team dealing with several contexts.  It would be nice if the AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter class could also implement Ordered interface so that the DispatcherServlet could keep defined ordering for the handler adapters.

It's unfortunate, because JUnit cannot replace this class wholly. JUnit can only capture exceptions at the test level; not at a method level. If multiple invoked methods can throw the same exception, it's not possible for `@Test` to determine which one failed. It is not always practical -- or desireable -- to refactor testing methods that invoke multiple methods; building tests sometimes require complicated setup.  I recommend simply noting the benefits and drawbacks between AssertThrows and `@Test` and remove the deprecation. Deprecations get removed from the framework; this should not be a candidate for removal.  ---  **Issue Links:** - #11028 Refactor AssertThrows to support Throwable instead of Exception  1 votes, 3 watchers","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-25T12:59:17Z","2019-01-11T16:29:17Z"

For example; a list of employees should be returned directly for rendering HTML, but should be wrapped in a JAXB class for rendering XML, as in the following example.  ```java @RequestMapping(value = ""/list.html"") //Doesn't work for accept header! public ModelAndView listHTML(HttpServletRequest request) {      ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();     mav.addObject(""employees"", employeeDao.listEmployees());     return mav; }  @RequestMapping(value = ""/list.xml"") //Doesn't work for accept header! public ModelAndView listXML(HttpServletRequest request) {     ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();     mav.addObject(""employees"", new EmployeeList(employeeDao.listEmployees()));      return mav; } ```  There seems to be no easy way at this moment to apply this. Of course you could use the headers parameter in the `@RequestMapping`, but that doesn't work when a request is done without the accept header using an extension in the url instead (e.g. list.xml). When using an url extension as in the above example it doesn't work when only the accept header is set.  JAX-RS has a `@Produces` and `@Consumes` annotation which does the job perfectly.

It would be useful if additional content negotiation, such as using file name extensions, request parameter and a default media type were also provided. This is similar to the approach provided by the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver for views.  I have implemented an example implementation if you'd like to use that as a basis for the implementation.  Look at the ServletHandlerMethodInvoker.handleResponseBodyMethod and the ServletHandlerMethodInvoker.resolveRequestBody. You'll see it uses a MediaTypeUtils class to get all the possible accepted media types.  The MediaTypeUtils uses the mediaTypeOrder field to decide which order the content negotiation should be performed in. This gives the developer the option to decide which types of content negotiation can be performed and the precedence order of these. The important thing to note is that all media types from all the selected sources are added so that there is fall back if one of the options is not supported by the different message converters.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1  **Attachments:** - [AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16304/AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.java) (_47.27 kB_) - [ContentNegotatingResponseBody.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16474/ContentNegotatingResponseBody.java) (_5.91 kB_) - [ContentNegotatingResponseBody.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16473/ContentNegotatingResponseBody.java) (_5.86 kB_) - [MediaTypeUtil.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16303/MediaTypeUtil.java) (_4.29 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #11163 `@RequestMapping` should support accept header and url extension (_**""duplicates""**_) - #13057 Content negotiation improvements (_**""is superseded by""**_)  9 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-16T03:37:51Z","2019-01-13T07:54:48Z"

The reason for this probably lies in the fact, that of course `List` gets erased to `List` and thus the pointcut arguments get a primitive type of `List` assigned and thus matches also lists of non-`MySpecialType`. I tried to add concrete type information to the `args(...)` directive as follows:  ```java @Before(""execution(* Foo+.bar(..)) && args(param)"") ```  This get's parsed by the `PointcutParser` successfully but the information is neglected during matching. The only way around seems to be making a collection member type check inside the advice manually which is a little ugly IMHO.

This way the following would be possible.  ```java @RunWith(SpringJUnitClassRunner.class) @ContextConfigLocation(""classpath:foo.xml"") public class SampleTest {    @Autowired   private MyService myService;    @Bean   public MyRepository repository() {     return Mockito.mock(MyRepository.class);   }    // Testcases } ```  IMHO this has the benefit of not polluting the test resources with zillions of config files that you might want to declare to override certain beans from your default configuration (which you would additionally load inside `@ContextConfigLocation`). As this co-locates customization needed for the tests and the tests themselves it reduces scattering of artifacts needed for the tests.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  3 votes, 7 watchers","open","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-04T19:11:47Z","2019-07-10T16:16:59Z"

I imagine something similar to the `` element already present, where you provide either predefined subelements or plain bean definitions. Although one could argue that the benefit is rather limited it completes the picture of configurable MVC components nicely, especially as the order can then be determined explicitly.

If this bean is referenced as factory-bean from another bean declaration the factory-method lookup will fail as `ConstructorResolver` uses `ClassUtils.getUserClass(...)` uses the superclass of the CGLib class which is `Object` for proxies of an interface and thus the interface's factory method can't be found. I wonder what's the exact rationale behind the user class lookup? Is it possible to explicitly handle `Object` superclasses (as one can assume that the CGLib proxy has to have been created for an interface) and use the CGLib class then?  In my particular usecase I setup mocks for interfaces using Mockito which creates exactly such a scenario. My workaround in this case is to let the proxy be created for an implementation of the interface, so that the superclass is not object then. As such scenarios probably only pop up in test case scenarios, it's probably no big deal. But as it works with 2.5.6 (that doesn't have the user class lookup included) the effect is probably quite puzzling when upgrading to 3.0.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e2a9bc9c6658226c283a50c807e2de5053a21cee  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-03T20:32:48Z","2012-06-19T03:43:07Z"

Especially when using CGLib and thus having to provide a (at least protected) no-arg constructor Spring seems to choose the empty no-arg constructor when resolution fails for any other constructor. This raises the general question in what order constructors are considered if multiple are available. I've been searching the docs, logging output and the forums but couldn't find any real details.  Attached you'll find a sample project with:  * a class with a no-arg constructor and one to be wired to an interface * two implementations of that interface to simulate ambiguity * a test case that proofs the no-arg constructor to be used    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Attachments:** - [constructor-res.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16113/constructor-res.zip) (_18.67 kB_)","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-24T18:19:44Z","2015-09-22T18:20:31Z"

Suppose the folloeing case:  You have an interface as well as an implementation. The implementation is using `@Transactional` for transaction demarcation **and** implements `EventListener`. As there is a JDK dynamic proxy created by Spring, the reflective lookup of the event type fails, which causes Spring to assume the implementation actually declares a raw `EventListener` and thus also hands `ContextClosedEvent` e.g. which then in turn leads to a `ClassCastException` as the method only accepts `ContextRefreshedEvent` as parameter.  The major problem is that I see no correct way of solving this as Spring cannot simply reject the listener instead of blindly handing all events to it. As the main issue with the current situation is, that it is not really obvious **why** the `ClassCastException` occurs, a feasible solution might be to check the inspected listener instance for implementing `Adviced` and log a warning if also implements `EventListener` **and** does not return the event type.

As I can understand that one might want to keep the filter independent of Spring MVC, I'd suggest to introduce a subclass that might lookup a configured multipartResolver from the application context and use it to obtain the parameters. As we deal with a filter this would require the resolver being declared inside the `ApplicationContext` loaded by the `ContextLoaderListener`. This feels a little ugly as one probably should tend to avoid web things inside this `ApplicationContext`.  As the only existing implementation is `CommonsMultipartResolver` and this implementation uses a static method of `ServletFileUpload` a reasonable way might also be just to check the availablity of Commons Fileupload in the classpath and using this method to determine the multipart nature of the request then.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Issue Links:** - [ROO-442](https://jira.spring.io/browse/ROO-442) Provide multipart file upload support (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #12451 ServletRequestDataBinder does not bind MultipartFile with HiddenHttpMethodFilter and Multipart Request  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/2c9753ad253e2280ce846ff3155bbe6706883fcf, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/0eabef072077bbd49dc5f757564266d1dea52255  4 votes, 11 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-21T02:58:57Z","2019-01-11T15:24:44Z"

This solves the problem at a first glance but I think it would be more clean to prevent processing of the request entirely if no valid accept header was set by using the algorithm `getmediaTypes(..)` in `CNVR`.

Consider the following situation: class X implements the interface I which in turn is a subinterface of J. There is a special converter for J-to-String. The classQueue will be filled in this case with - X - I (from X.getInterfaces()) - Object (from X.getSuperclass()) - J (from I.getInterfaces())  Since Object appears before J the generic ObjectToStringConverter will be used here instead of the more specific converter for J.

In other words if I want to convert Foo to String and there is no FooToString cnverter I want to see can't convert exception and not rely on the default generic strategy.  Currently in SI we have to remove bunch of converters in order to use the ConversionService  I also need ability to chain/synthesize converters.

Application starts properly and then scheduler starts in 120 seconds after factory has been created in context.  So, everything works fine. But now imagine the following situation.  Right after the application successfully start I decide to shutdown it. This could be required for some reasons. This situation is typical when developing.  So Tomcat has been shutdowned. Context has been destroyed. But SchedulerFactoryBean's thread is still sleeping and waiting while specified timeout ends. The JVM is waiting for this thread and can not be closed. And after timeout ends the Quartz scheduler starts in destroyed context.

That is, they don't actually exist; instead, SQL Server computes their values based on other columns' values whenever a record is inserted or updated. (This is necessary for me because there are times I need to do case-insensitive comparisons on these columns and times I need to do case-sensitive comparisons, and SQL Server is case-insensitive on varchar columns and case-sensitive on varbinary columns.)  I then perform an insert on this table as follows:  ``` int count = (new SimpleJdbcInsert(this.getDataSource())).withTableName(""lookup_codes"").execute( 		(new MapSqlParameterSource()).addValue(""tableId"", code.getTableId()). 				addValue(""code"", code.getCode()). 				addValue(""description"", code.getDescription()) ); ```  Spring JDBC them attempts to insert unspecified (unknown-to-me) values into code_binary and description_binary and the following error occurs:  ``` org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException: Request processing failed; nested exception is  	org.springframework.jdbc.BadSqlGrammarException: PreparedStatementCallback; bad SQL grammar  	[INSERT INTO lookup_codes (tableId, code, description, code_binary, description_binary)  		VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)]; nested exception is  		com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The column ""code_binary"" cannot be modified  			because it is either a computed column or is the result of a UNION operator. ```  If I add .usingColumns(""tableId"", ""code"", ""description"") to the Java statement, it works, so this isn't a blocker, but SimpleJdbcInsert should not attempt to insert values into computed columns, even if usingColumns is not called.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC2","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2009-11-18T02:10:14Z","2019-01-12T03:50:44Z"

They can be returned in HSQL DB 1.9.0 (and possibly 1.8, but I haven't tested that).  In IntelliJ I am running a unit test with which I am testing a data access object. I am using the EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder to create, populate, and discard a database for each test executed and pass the data source it generates to my DAO. Everything works well until the DAO I am testing calls executeAndReturnKey() on a SimpleJdbcInsert object. This method throws a DataIntegrityViolationException with message ""Unable to retreive[sic] the generated key for the insert"".  I debugged a single insert for over an hour, going nearly 100 levels deep into the stacktrace, and determined that the HSQL DB 1.9.0 JDBC driver is, for sure, returning the generated key. For some reason, Spring isn't picking it up and thinks it failed, thus throwing the exception.  Needless to say, this makes testing inserts using HSQL DB rather difficult. I currently have an ugly workaround to make sure the insert at least succeeded. It does. I just can't get the generated key. My target database will actually be SQL Server, so I'm not concerned about this affecting my production application. It just affects testing.

This behaviour is changed in spring 3.0.0. A new introduced AntPatternComparator in 3.0.0 is used for this propose:  ``` org.springframework.util.AntPathMatcher.AntPatternComparator ```  In this case the comparator sorts the shorter url mapping (/\*\*/login.\*) higher than the longer one (/\*\*/endUser/action/login.\*). This results in matching  controller1 when using the url: **http://www.domain.com/context/web/endUser/action/login.html** Which is not correct in my view.  I presume that a best match is the match with the most matched characters in url path.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/0cb9271b9528cf863f43fc67977ec60f1cda2067","closed","","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-14T00:26:34Z","2019-01-11T16:25:06Z"

Meaning that if I submit a request value like the following:  (Taken from Webkit's standard accept header)  ``` application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 ```  And I have a controller like the following:  ``` @Controller public class ExampleController {     @RequestMapping(value=""/secure/example"", headers=""accept=text/html"", method=RequestMethod.GET)     public String showHtml() {         ...     }      @RequestMapping(value=""/secure/example"", headers=""accept=image/png"", method=RequestMethod.GET)     public String showPng() {         ...     } } ```  Then the showHtml method is selected because it is closest to the left where the showPng method should have been selected as it expresses a higher preferred quality level from the client (default quality=1).  This issue is related to #11663 but the order of the header media types should probably be taken into account AFTER the quality is taken into account.  This issue is also related to #11617 though since it appears #11617 won't make it into 3.0.x I think that this issue represents a more direct problem with a more straight forward solution that I believe should be included in to a 3.0.x release.  I think the order of media type method resolution should be the following:  1. Quality 2. Specificity 3.

I would like html returned to browsers and xml or json returned to computer clients that request that specific content type. I have a controller that looks like the following:  ``` @Controller public class ExampleController {     @RequestMapping(value="" /example"", headers={""accept=application/xml,application/json""})     public SomeObject restService() {...}      @RequestMapping(value="" /example"", headers={""accept=text/html,application/html+xml""})     public String html() {...} } ```  This looks like it will work until you run into a browser like WebKit that uses an accept header like:  ``` Accept=application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 ```  Or IE that submits an accept header like:  ``` */* ```  This problem is somewhat related to #11599.  Though it turns out that identifying the correct handler method based on accept header is actually more complicated than simply the order of the accept media types like I originally thought. :)  After some research I believe Spring MVC should employ a content negotiation method similar to the one implemented in Apache (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/content-negotiation.html) though without having to deal with language, encoding, or charset.  The basic premise is that just like the client can notify the server how well it can support various content types using the 'q' or 'quality' modifier the server should have equal ability to say the level of quality it provides various content types.  If server side quality were used in content negotiation in Spring MVC that would allow me to change my ExampleController to prefer html to xml or json like so:  ``` @Controller public class ExampleController {     @RequestMapping(value="" /example"", headers={""accept=application/xml;q=0.5,application/json;q=0.4""})     public SomeObject restService() {...}      @RequestMapping(value="" /example"", headers={""accept=text/html,application/html+xml""})     public String html() {...} } ```  Following the content negotiation rules detailed in the Apache document spring mvc would multiply the ""q"" values of the client and server media types that match preferring more specific matches to less specific matches.  In the example above using WebKit's accept header when requesting '/example' the combined media types would be resolved to the following table:  |Client|Server|Result| |:---|:---|:---| |application/xhtml+xml;q=1|x application/xhtml+xml;q=1|== appilication/xhtml+xml;q=1| |text/html;q=0.9|x text/html;q=1|== text/html;q=0.9| |application/xml;q=1|x application/xml;q=0.5|== application/xml;q=0.5| |\*/\*;q=0.5|x application/json;q=0.4|== application/json;q=0.2|  If there is a tie then the client accept header that comes first is selected (#11599).  In the case of wildcards without quality modifiers apache applies a lower default quality \*/\*;q=0.1 image/*;q=0.2.  I imagine Spring MVC would want to do the same.  So and IE result table would look like the following:  |Client|Server|Result| |:---|:---|:---| |\*/\*;q=0.1|x application/xhtml+xml;q=1|== appilication/xhtml+xml;q=.1| |\*/\*;q=0.1|x text/html;q=1|== text/html;q=0.1| |\*/\*;q=0.1|x application/xml;q=0.5|== application/xml;q=0.05| |\*/\*;q=0.1|x application/json;q=0.5|== application/json;q=0.04|  The result of this algorithm would also need to be applied to the `@ResponseBody` rendering especially with the fix for #11543.  And it will need to be applied to ContentNegotiatingViewResolver and can be specified as part of the mediaTypes specified in the mediaTypes property.  In this case the negotiation wouldn't be on a per methodhandler basis but should still work.  I would be happy to supply a patch if you think that would be useful.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1  **Attachments:** - [quality1.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16269/quality1.patch) (_11.58 kB_) - [quality2.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16270/quality2.patch) (_11.85 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #11665 AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter gives priority to media type order over quality when selecting a method","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-05T06:07:46Z","2019-01-11T16:30:46Z"

Our rest services are multichannel.  I would like to use the content negotiation rules supported in the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver to determine the content type of my response.  This work great.  However, all of my encoded responses include the Key from the ModelAndView map key making my restful services response ugly.  I can use `@ResponseBody` on my handler method which will produce a clean response but then the response content type negotiation is determined by AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.ServletHandlerMethodInvoker.handleResponseBody(Object, ServletWebRequest) completely bypassing ContentNegotiatingViewResolver and rendering useless my HandlerInterceptors that depend upon response not being committed before they are called.  handleResponseBody() is much less extensible than using a ViewResolver.  I can work around this issue by overriding the filterModel() method in the View implementations I configure in ContentNegotiatingViewResolver to simply check to see if there is a single item in the model and returning only that single item if there is.  It would be nice to have a standard solution for this problem.

It would be nice if context:component-scan were made more pluggable so that one or more ""ComponentScanPostProcessors"" can be provided to further manipulate bean definitions found during component-scan.  This can be accomplished today be creating a custom NameSpaceHandler that uses a customized version of ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner that overrides ""postProcessBeanDefinition"".  However, this approach has 2 problems: 1. Impacts the usability of my customization because it is a non spring standard handler which impacts IDE, documentation, etc. 2. If I have 2 component scan manipulations things get more complicated because now I need to make a singe handler that does all my custom scanning operations (not very modular) or I need to create 3 different scanners (one for each manipulation and one that does both). 3. postProcessBeanDefinition should return an instance of AbstractBeanDefinition so that the Component created beandefinition can be more fully manipulated (e.g. wrapping it in a proxy or something).  context:component scan could simply accept a list of beans that implement an interfaces with a single method similar to postProcessBeanDefinition.

Anyway, given that we're gonna introduce the conversation scope in Spring 3.1, I can't see how we could keep `@SessionAttributes`.

In a web environment, the current conversation id would most likely be bound to the current window / tab (see #11083) and hence be based on the window management. This makes it possible to run different conversations per browser window and isolating them from each other by default.  In a unit-test or batch environment the current conversation could be bound to the current thread to make conversations be available in a non-web environment as well.  The current conversation id is stored in a ThreadLocal and available through a ConversationContextHolder which itself will use the conversation resolver to determine the current conversation id. In a web environment, this resolver could be done by using the a window scoped bean to hold the current conversation id or directly do it by combining the current window id and the conversation id.

If an object from a static class containing the name of the Spring Bean is serialized using writeReplace, the equivalent proxy can be retrieved using readResolve when deserializing.

I noticed that in my logging, the method seems to be executed twice. To make sure it wasn't a logging issue, I put a static int counter into the class and have it increment on each call. So I can confirm the method is actually being run twice.

As such the security policy is setup to disallow access to System.getProperties() as this will return a mutable view of all the system properties and if one application were to manipulate these it may adversely affect other applications in the same container.  We know the workaround for now is to simply drop in a bean named systemProperties but we would prefer a fix on the Spring side for this because it will likely catch all other groups that run a similar model to us.

When i tried to use JBossWorkManagerUtils for resolving the a given work manager,  i realized that it only resolves the default work manager published by jboss using JMX technology under  ""jboss.jca:service=WorkManager"" object name. So i propose the following refactoring where JBossWorkManagerUtils provides two methods: * getDefaultWorkManager : resolves the default jboss workmanager using ""jboss.jca:service=WorkManager"" as object name * getWorkManager(wm) : produces a JMX lookup process using ""wm"" parameter as workmanager's object name.  The JBossWorkManagerTaskExecutor was refactorized in order to be compliant with the new version of JBossWorkManagerUtils. Additionally a new property was added called ""workManagerObjectName"" which allows to specify a custom work manager object name that later is used for invoking JBossWorkManagerUtils.getWorkManager method.

In web.xml I have Log4jConfigListener declared ahead of RequestContextListener, but the application server container is instantiating RequestContextListener before Log4jConfigListener's requestInitialized is called. This causes Log4J Logger member variable of RequestContextListener initialized: RequestContextListener protected final Log logger = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());  The problem seems like the reporter of #10645 describes: At least in Tomcat 6, the listeners all appear to be instantiated, then the contextInitialized(...) method is called on them in the order declared in the web.xml.  It appears that the same happens with Oracle OC4J and maybe Weblogic and other AppServers.

Mostly due to the fact that tx:annotation-driven is configured in the root ApplicationContext and that context:component-scan is defined in both the root as well as the servlet ApplicationContext. This results in 2 instances of a `@Service`/`@Repository` being available.  A hint/example in the web chapter of the reference guide would help here on how to configure the context:component-scan in such a case. 1. only scan `@Controller` in the servlet and everything but `@Controller` in the root. 2. Configure mvc to look for `@Controller` in the root context, leaving the servlet context almost clean.  either way should work, although I guess that option 1 is the preffered way.   ---  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=282436#post282436","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-04T23:44:10Z","2019-01-12T03:50:33Z"

I'm sure more developers will run into this.  Basically, in order to support REST, your web.xml dispatcher servlet ""suddenly"" has to accept any kind of url-pattern as opposed to *.html. This opens a can of worms as the dispatcher servlet then tries to map all kinds of resources passing through. The solutions is to either  1. Have a prefix in front of all your controller mappings and using url rewriting to rewrite incoming urls to that prefix 2. Use the default servlet to filter out all the static resources.  Both have pros and cons Ad 1. You have to create a prefix. Sucks on an existing project you want to refactor to REST I haven't found an option in Spring to set a ""default"" prefix for all handler mappings. Would be a nice to have. Then you would never need Ad 2  Ad 2. You have to know all file extensions of resources to be served. Possible in most projects, but not all.  The forum reference suggests the possible solutions I found as described above. Definitely something to be aware of at the start of a project. And therefore a good idea to add to the documentation.

The AccountService bean however has has been annotated with `@Service` and the constructor with `@Autowired` to make Spring create it and inject the necessary dependencies automatically. This therefore makes startup fail with the error:  ``` org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'conversionService' defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/spring/general.xml]: Cannot create inner bean 'com.test.converters.StringToAccountConverter#1e565bd' of type [com.test.converters.StringToAccountConverter] while setting bean property 'converters' with key [0]; nested exception is  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'com.test.StringToAccountConverter#1e565bd' defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/spring/general.xml]: Cannot resolve reference to bean 'accountService' while setting bean property 'accountService';  nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'accountService' defined in file [...AccountServiceImpl.class]: Instantiation of bean failed;  nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: Could not instantiate bean class [com.test.AccountServiceImpl]: No default constructor found;  nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: com.test.AccountServiceImpl.() ```  A temporary fix is to put the conversion service in the servlet specific Web Application context (and not the global application context) as it can then initialize the global context with the AccountService before creating the conversion service. It would however be nice to put the conversion service in the global context to make the custom converters globally available.

The property is of type Map and trying to inject a map using XML config (\\\) will create a LinkedHashMap and trigger the MapToMapConverter, which will try to convert the LinkedHashMap to a map of type Map. This doesn't work as the TypeDescriptor for Map reports that the value doesn't have a type, i.e. TypeDescriptor.NULL, which will eventually lead to a RuntimeException being thrown and as such the application cannot be started. I guess it is the wildcard that makes it difficult for the TypeDescriptor to decide on a type for the value, as the GenericCollectionTypeResolver cannot get a type for the unbounded wildcard.  I don't know if the problem is supposed to be fixed in UrlBasedViewResolver (by changing the type of the argument to setAttributesMap) or if it is the MapToMapConverter, TypeDescriptor or GenericCollectionTypeResolver that is at fault and should be fixed.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Issue Links:** - #11473 ConversionService fails with CustomEditorConfigurer  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7cbd9e1d93b712f5ac098f06b7407dfc90e0d1d8","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-12T00:21:44Z","2019-01-11T16:16:54Z"

For example from what I can tell by default if you new an `@Configurable` object which does not have its dependencies configured it will error on the Constructor instantiation.  If there is a way of indicating to validate pre this stage it would be less fragile.

When I try to use `@Autowire` to link all beans together, I got one exception because JavaConfig cannot find out the bean. In the test case, I have Spring's JaxWsPortProxyFactoryBean bean in xml config, and I use `@Autowire` to get its instance in JavaConfig. Next, I have one ComponentManager bean in XML config which will query application context to extract all components. Finally, I have one bean which called **myconnection**, which is used by JaxWsPortProxyFactoryBean.  The issue is: * When I declare the bean myconnection in XML Config, every thing is fine, and spring will successfully get started. * When I declare the bean myconnection in JavaConfig, Spring will fail to start its application context, because it cannot find out the bean for `@Autowire`  After looking into the code, I find that Spring treats JavaConfig class as a normal bean which causes circular dependencies issue in my `@Configuration` class. The reason is that my `@Configuration` class uses `@Autowire` to extract bean A from context, and the bean A need bean B in my JavaConfig. So, spring find there is a circular reference [@Configuration class] javaconfig -> `@Autowire` [bean A from xml config] -> inject [bean B from javaconfig] , and Spring cannot resolve this issue, so it throws one NoSuchBeanDefinitionException to say no A has been found.  Once we move myconnection from javaconfig to xml config the issue just goes away.

This issue was first noticed when using a `DefaultMessageListenerContainer`, but it affects any similar bean.  **Root Cause** The `DefaultLifecycleProcessor` used by the `AbstractApplicationContext` class does not properly maintain its internal countdown latch.  The latch is initialized with the total `SmartLifecycle` bean count.  However, if a bean returns false from its `isRunning()` method, the latch is never decremented in the {{doStop()} method.  The result is a timeout during close waiting for the latch to be decremented.  Unless I'm missing something, a simple else block with a decrement on the latch should do the trick.

Constructs such as !registry.containsBeanDefinition(...) check only in current registry, thus resulting in the processors being created, if only config scanning is used ( as one notable example of the configuration cousing it to happen).  It seems that thus redundand instances are then removed by call to destroySingletons() [guess, did not manage to understand all the details].  I have noticed, that for SWF, GenericWebApplicationContext is created for the flow definition, and the processors are always created in that context, even if no configuration causing this is present in other places (in main Web App context, or in Dispatcher Servlet context linked to it).  In most situations the impact is negligible, only few extra definitions are added (do beans themselves get created ? not sure ...). However, AnnotationContextUtils use concrete classes, and cause them to load. If the loading of the classes fail, entire context is not loaded, even though the beans that are being defined could be potentially removed at once by destroySingletons().  In some cases, such as in Google App Engine and PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, the simple fact that the class cannot be loaded renders entire context unusable. There is no way it can be overcomed, cause even if the bean named appripriately is defined in the main app context, id does not stop the offending class from loading, when AnnotationContextUtils are used.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6  **Issue Links:** - #11345 Provide PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor without JNDI dependency.","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-31T04:35:37Z","2019-01-12T16:38:30Z"

It is indeed 'static nested class'. Java has four types of nested classes namely, 'static nested class', 'inner class', 'local class' and 'anonymous class'. http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/summarynested.html  The explanation about the terminology on the web page from the following link can probably be a reason why the term 'static inner class' is wrong. http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html  It says, ""Terminology: Nested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static. Nested classes that are declared static are simply called static nested classes. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes.""  As it tells, 'inner class' already means 'NON-static' thus the term 'static inner class' itself is contradictory.

"","10982","Provide a ""FrameworkFilter"" as a Wicket-friendly alternative to FrameworkServlet [SPR-6316]","**[Kenny MacLeod](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=skaffman)** opened **[SPR-6316](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6316?redirect=false)** and commented  I've been doing some work seeing how best to integrate Apache Wicket into our existing Spring MVC applications. In particular, I'm trying to retain our ""one spring context per servlet"" architecture.  I've had a look at how the Wicket folks have integrated with Spring already, and in order for Wicket code to access spring beans, it requires that those spring beans reside in the root webapp context. This isn't always desirable, however, such as in our case where each servlet has its own spring context. So I've been trying to see how to allow Wicket to access the servlet appcontext.  The main problem is that Wicket is implemented as a Filter, not a Servlet. This makes the lifecycle of the application a bit fragile. If there's a Spring servlet that creates and manages the appcontext, and this servlet is configured to initialise on container startup, then it can publish the appcontext to the ServletContext. When the first request comes in, the Wicket filter can retrieve this context and the beans therein.  If the ""load on startup"" flag is not set on the servlet, however, this all breaks, which makes things all a little bit too fragile.  Additionally, we need to have a Spring DispatcherServlet present in order to manage the context, even though Spring will not be doing any actual dispatching, since Wicket has control. The servlet is there purely to perform appcontext management.  My suggestion is to provide a servlet Filter which would sit in front of the Wicket filter, and would perform similar tasks to that currently performed by FrameworkServlet, e.g. context initialization and publishing. Perhaps the meat of FrameworkServlet could be extracted into a more neutral class, and invoked by both FrameworkServlet and our new filter.  There's a strong similarity here to ContextLoader and ContextLoaderListener, but those are very simple, performing only root context initialisation.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6, 3.0 RC1","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-11-09T01:41:20Z","2018-12-26T16:24:49Z"

While I totally appreciate a lot of the advancements, there are a few features that are just ""missing"".  The one thing I am having problems with is `@RequestBody`. It seems that Spring is handling JSON mappings to Strings, ints, longs and other primitive types just fine. Unfortunately... and this is extremely disappointing... Spring does not also use the property editors.  So, in its current state, we can create an object with ""long myDomainObjectId"" but not ""MyDomainObject myDomainObject"" and have Spring do the mapping for us. Instead, Spring throws back:  ``` The server refused this request because the request entity is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method (). ```  In Firebug, it just says, ""Unsupported Mime type"". And before you say anything, I am sending ""application/json"" with the charset set to utf8 (as many examples say to do, although I've tried it all kinds of ways). I have used every option conceivable in jQuery - this is a problem with Spring.  So guys... are we supposed to do all this mapping ourselves? What if we are sending json data that is nested 2 or 3 times - do we manually traverse the ""long[] ids"" arrays and fetch everything ourselves? What if we have to do this for 100 controllers actions? My god, that is insane.  ---  Now, I have tried to use GET instead of POST, even though POST is what I want. However, this causes all kinds of other problems with jQuery. For example,  ``` {""activeQuestion"":""551"",""categories"":[""129"",""129"",""128""],""categoryAnswers"":[""487"",""489"",""488""]} ```  You would think that this would transfer fine... but it doesn't. jQuery creates these GET Request headers:  ``` ?activeQuestion=551& categories[]=129& categories[]=128& categoryAnswers[]=487& categoryAnswers[]=488 ```  As you can see, it doesn't put the indexes for the array notation, and it also chops out a duplicate. The only way to fix this via jQuery is to wrap the numbers in their own objects. Man, talk about bloated! That means we have to create bloated DTO objects that mirror the JSON data... and then convert to the ""REAL"" domain model afterward.  While this GET approach is slightly better because at least Spring does in fact do use the property editors... we still have to create a bunch of dummy objects that pollute the system for every controller action. Not to mention, we have to use GET for everything - even things that should be POST.  ---  I will admit, maybe I don't know enough about Spring 3.0's new features and there is solutions around this stuff... but that only emphasizes the failure of your documentation then... as well as the failure in your ""Spring 3.0 Simplications for Ajax"" article, which doesn't talk about doing anything complicated.  And I'm just getting started... but it seems all Ajax examples in every framework - JavaScript or otherwise - just show really simple, easy examples. I guess they know their frameworks aren't up to snuff when it comes to something complex - like ""a list of numbers"".  Guys, why can't we just get this stuff to ""Work""? :(  Thanks for listening. I apologize for venting, but I have went from YUI 3.0 -> jQuery... and now because of jQuery's poor API design as well as it's crappy .ajax implementation, I may have to try out Dojo to see if it's any better. YUI 3.0 is bloated beyond belief, it's ajax requests are 10x slower than jQuery's... and ultimately, the new sandbox model is terrible for trying to wrap YUI in an application core framework to make sure it doesn't get exposed to higher levels of the application-specific JavaScript.  It would seem that nobody has gotten this ajax stuff to work seamlessly. Yuck. No wonder I don't want to touch it.

This servlet has proven generally useful and, as a user, I'd like this functionality available in Spring Framework's core web support.  Specifically:  * I'd like this functionality to be configurable within a Spring MVC DispatcherServlet, without requiring another servlet to be configured in web.xml.  This simplifies setup and also allows for greater configuration control with the Spring MVC namespace.  * Caching should be aggressive.  All resources served up should be cached with a far out expiration date (e.g. 1 year).  * Compression should be applied to text-based resources e.g. .css, .js, .json, and .xml files (should be possible to disable)  * Minification should be applied to text-based resources where possible e.g. .js (should be possible to disable)  * Resource bundling should be supported.  This provides the ability to load multiple resources in one HTTP request, which can improve performance.  * Resource versioning should be supported.  This causes clients to refresh cached resources when a new version of the application is deployed.  This prevents clients from working with stale content after deployment of a new version. (should be possible to disable, when disabled no caching should be performed)  * It should be possible to serve resources out of the webapp root as well as jar file bundles.  * The ResourceHandler should aim to be compatible with JSF 2.0 resource handling as far as possible (we should not make compromises but we shouldn't be different when we can align).  The ResourceHandler should also be capable of being the ""default handler"" for the DispatcherServlet.  This would provide a static resource handling fallback similar to how the Servlet Container works.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Attachments:** - [ResourceHttpRequestHandler.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16481/ResourceHttpRequestHandler.java) (_9.01 kB_) - [ResourceHttpRequestHandlerTests.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16482/ResourceHttpRequestHandlerTests.java) (_6.44 kB_)  **Sub-tasks:** - #11799 Add support for compressing resources  **Issue Links:** - #12058 Improve handling of static resources  (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #11307 Move org.springframework.js.resource.ResourceServlet to Spring framework core (_**""supersedes""**_)  9 votes, 16 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-21T13:47:00Z","2019-01-13T21:46:18Z"

I've reproduced the issue in both an acceptance test (inside a sample Spring MVC web application) & a standalone unit test.  From what I can tell, this problem has to do with the use of ITDs on the bind target class.  In this sample, `@RooJavaBean` is placed on the class & used to generate an ITD that introduces getter/setter property accessors for the ""aDate"" field.  When conversion runs, the TypeDescriptor built for this property simply does NOT contain the field annotation-information, so `@DateTimeFormat` is not respected and the conversion rule is not applied.  If I remove use of ITDs, and just end up with a plain JavaBean, binding & type conversion works fine--the TypeDescriptor is built properly.  What makes this issue more odd is it seems limited to this one field named ""aDate"".  Binding to another field named ""birthDate"" works fine, even when ITDs are used.  So the name of the field also appears to have something to do with this.  Here are the artifacts illustrating the problem:  The JavaBean bind target:  ``` @RooJavaBean public class Stefan {      @DateTimeFormat(style = ""S-"")     private Date birthDate;      @DateTimeFormat(style = ""S-"")     private Date aDate; } ```  The Roo-generated ITD:  ```  privileged aspect Stefan_Roo_JavaBean {          public Date Stefan.getBirthDate() {         return this.birthDate;     }          public void Stefan.setBirthDate(Date birthDate) {         this.birthDate = birthDate;     }          public Date Stefan.getADate() {         return this.aDate;     }          public void Stefan.setADate(Date aDate) {         this.aDate = aDate;     }      } ```  Test case:  ``` public class DataBinderTests { 	@Test 	public void testaDate() { 		Stefan s = new Stefan(); 		DataBinder binder = new DataBinder(s); 		FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean factory = new FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean(); 		factory.afterPropertiesSet(); 		FormattingConversionService conversionService = factory.getObject(); 		binder.setConversionService(conversionService); 		MutablePropertyValues pvs = new MutablePropertyValues(); 		pvs.addPropertyValue(""birthDate"", ""4/15/10""); 		pvs.addPropertyValue(""aDate"", ""4/15/10""); 		binder.bind(pvs); 		assertFalse(binder.getBindingResult().hasFieldErrors(""birthDate""));		 		assertFalse(binder.getBindingResult().hasFieldErrors(""aDate""));		 		assertEquals(""4/15/10"", binder.getBindingResult().getFieldValue(""birthDate"")); 		// FAILS -- value is Thu Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2010 - which is date.toString() 		assertEquals(""4/15/10"", binder.getBindingResult().getFieldValue(""aDate"")); 	} } ```  If you take the Stefan class and ""push in"" the ITD to make it a regular JavaBean, the test case will pass.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Issue Links:** - [ROO-787](https://jira.spring.io/browse/ROO-787) Calendar widget doesn't show in update view (_**""is depended on by""**_)","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-16T01:20:27Z","2012-06-19T03:43:35Z"

Currently, integrating such frameworks like Spring Security require the registration of a DelegatingFilterProxy in web.xml that calls into a Root WebApplicationContext, which must also be setup and configured.  The introduction of a context hierarchy just to satisfy the technical limitations of container-managed filters is a source of complexity.  For many applications, a single DispatcherServlet-based WebApplicationContext is sufficient and provides a simpler home for web application beans.  It also puts more logic under the control of the DispatcherServlet, which allows you to keep your configuration consistently Spring-based instead of a mix of Spring and web.xml configuration.  I could imagine this being implemented by having the DispatcherServlet detect a special ""filterChain"" bean by name on deployment, similar to the other pluggable DispatcherServlet services.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1  2 votes, 4 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-24T13:08:20Z","2018-12-26T12:29:15Z"

This can be worked around by defining annotations on the method parameter of a setter method, and the return value of a getter, but is not ideal.  SpEL should be consistent with BeanWrapper with its TypeDescriptor configuration when getting and setting JavaBean properties.  This likely means use of a BeanTypeDescriptor in those cases.  This was noticed when attempting to use a SpEL-based data mapper to map String fields in a Map to a JavaBean, where annotation-driven parsing rules were specified on JavaBean fields.  This works fine with a BeanWrapper since the BeanTypeDescriptor exposes annotations from the field, getter, and setter.  Unfortunately, SpEl just uses the default TypeDescriptor in these cases which only exposes parameter annotations.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Issue Links:** - #11493 Allow SpEl expressions to be evaluated from JSPs (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #10748 Create a Unified EL implementation with Spring EL  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/117b1382333bd7e2ae26a85359b3cda89df9afef","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-21T08:33:52Z","2019-01-13T21:47:23Z"

Any failures result seems to result in an exception (500) being thrown.  For example, when Jackson fails to bind a 500 error is returned and you have no control over this like you do when failures are first added to the BindingResult context.  - When using `@RequestBody` you cannot trigger execution of a validation step post binding with the `@Valid` annotation.  We should look at getting consistency between the ""traditional"" DataBinder mechanism and the `@RequestBody` mechanism where it is possible.  If it's not possible or practical, we should at least document the differences between traditional binding and `@RequestBody`/`@ResponseBody` usage.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Issue Links:** - #11715 Allow usage of ConversionService for Jackson HttpMessageConverter  4 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-21T02:04:58Z","2019-12-20T14:49:51Z"

The latest maven.springframework.org snapshot is from January 13th, a week ago.  I do not know when the next one will publish, but I would expect them to publish consistent with EBR snapshot publication (nightly).  Otherwise its difficult for our user community, particularly those using Maven, to test out fixes in advance of the next release.  It's important to our user community and those managing our sample applications to see consistency in the publishing process between EBR and maven.springframework.org.  Right now it seems maven.springframework.org is getting the short-end of the stick--snapshots are not published there often (or in an automated fashion), and the artifact contents are actually different.

'activationDate' would be printed in a localized short date format (e.g. MM/dd/yy), and can also be parsed using that same format.  In many client-side UI frameworks, such as Dojo for example, it is possible (perhaps even common?) to use a different format pattern for rendering a value and sending a value back to the server.  For example, by default a Dojo Date widget will render a date in a browser-locale-specific way but will send back a normalized ISO date string.  In cases like this, it would be helpful if the datetime parser could also handle ISO date strings as a fallback, in cases where the parser was unable to parse a string by adhering to the configured localized style or pattern-based format also used for printing.  Alternatively or in addition, perhaps it should be possible to turn on an exclusive ISO-based parsing option.  This would make the parser more flexible for cases where printing client-side is handled in a locale specific manner but parsing server-side is sometimes/always ISO.  This could also potentially simplify the use of frameworks like Dojo in conjunction with JDK-based DateTime libraries such as Joda Time, since you would no longer need to ensure both libraries can handle the same localized pattern strings.  Rather, you'd simply configure Dojo displayPattern based on the `@DateTimeFormat` annotation, and use simpler (and more predictable) ISO parsing on postback.  As an example, Dojo doesn't directly support the pattern that corresponds to Joda's ""L"" (Long) style.  With no ISO parsing fallback, such a pattern has to be configurable though, otherwise parsing would fail on postback.  With an ISO parsing fallback, ""L"" could map to a Dojo specific pattern code; even if this Dojo specific ""L"" pattern did not match Joda's ""L"" pattern, parsing could still be done against a normalized ISO format as a fallback.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC3","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-10T00:20:16Z","2019-01-11T15:21:55Z"

The last one added is first out, and we go through the stack until we find the first match.  The main things to consider about the algorithm: - We consider the source->target type pair the ""most significant"" in terms of Converter resolution.  This is in contrast to indexing first on something like an annotation type, then determining if an annotation-driven converter matches the S->T request.  This allows the core Converter resolution algorithm to be unaware of annotation matching concepts, but it prevents annotation-driven formatting from being associated with abstract types. - Is the class/interface hierarchy search a potential performance concern?

However, the Joda format library can actually print **any** ReadableInstant (which includes DateTime) and ReadablePartial, while only being able to parse DateTime objects.  In this case, it would make logical sense to have separate ReadableInstantPrinter, ReadablePartialPrinter, and DateTimeParser classes.  For the current DateTimeFormatter, ReadablePartial implementations such as LocalDate must first be coersed to DateTime before they can be printed.

On the other path, if a classloader is set, it calls ClassUtils.forName(String, ClassLoader).  In the case of 1D primitive arrays this works due to a lookup map for 1D primitive array class ""names"" but higher dimension arrays aren't in that lookup map and it calls ClassLoader.loadClass(String) which doesn't expect (or handle) ""[[D"".

The JPA vendor is Hibernate 3.5.0-Beta-3.  It works well with JPQL, but when I tried to use CriteriaQuery, an exception happens:  java.lang.ClassCastException: $Proxy50 cannot be cast to javax.persistence.TypedQuery at $Proxy38.createQuery(Unknown Source) at com.absorbx.retailx.dao.impl.ShopDaoImpl.findByCrieria(ShopDaoImpl.java:30) at com.absorbx.retailx.dao.SimpleDaoTest.testFindByCriteria(SimpleDaoTest.java:39) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)  The DAO code:  `@Repository` public class ShopDaoImpl implements ShopDao { `@PersistenceContext` transient EntityManager entityManager;      @Override     public Shop findByCrieria() {         CriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();         CriteriaQuery c = cb.createQuery(Shop.class);         Root shop = c.from(Shop.class);         c.select(shop).where(cb.equal(shop.get(""name""), ""petstore""));         TypedQuery q = entityManager.createQuery(c);         return q.getSingleResult();     }  }  It seems to be a bug in Spring:  org/springframework/orm/jpa/SharedEntityManagerCreator.java:  if (result instanceof Query) { Query query = (Query) result; ... result = Proxy.newProxyInstance(Query.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[] {Query.class}, new DeferredQueryInvocationHandler(query, target)); ... }  Good catch. Spring is checking to see if the query is an instance of Query, and generates the proxy of that type. Unfortunately, TypedQuery is a subtype of Query, and the generated proxy will still only implement Query. TypedQuery was introduced in JavaEE 6, so it's understandable why Spring doesn't handle it, although Spring 3 is supposed to handle JavaEE 6 properly.

One use case: HandlerInterceptors are commonly used to add data to the model. If the controller supports POST request and does a redirect (which is the most common case) then the data added by the handler interceptor gets appended to the redirect url. This is undesirable. See http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=84140.  Another use case: The controller uses a session attribute. The GET inserts into the model (session). The POST accepts a SessionStatus and calls status.setComplete() and then does a redirect using ""redirect:view"". The model data is still appended to the end of the redirected URL. The programmer now has to accept the ModelMap and call clear() on it. This should really not be required. See http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=275392.  Therefore there needs to be a very simple way (i.e. view String prefix ) to do a redirect without exposing the model to the view. I see this as the default use case and the case of exposing the model as a less common use case.

Additionally, on page 456 (432 in footer) the EditPetForm controller is presented. The processSubmit() calls SessionStatus.setComplete() and then does a redirect.  Developers are implying from this that the model data is cleared before the redirect occurs. This is not the case. If the model data is eligible for exposing then the redirect url will have the model data appended to it. It so happens that the model data of EditPetForm's controller is not eligible for exposing because it's not String or primitive data.  To clear the data, the processSubmit() needs to accept a ModelMap object and call clear() on that before the redirect.  The documentation needs to be clearer on this issue. This should also be in the MVC step-by-step document which I understand is currently being composed.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=274959#post274959  4 votes, 2 watchers","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-21T04:48:53Z","2019-01-07T14:06:33Z"

In fact, it's quite difficult to reproduce before knowing the root cause.  ---  ## Steps to Reproduce  - Using Spring 2.5.6 or 3.0.0.RC1, JUnit 4; - Create a `SimpleDbOpService` (may or may not annotated with `@Transactional`), add a method to insert a record into DB based on the input parameters; - Create a SimpleDbOpATest:  ```java @ContextConfiguration({""base.xml"", ""A.xml""}) ```  - Create a SimpleDbOpBTest:  ```java @ContextConfiguration({""base.xml"", ""B.xml""}) ```  - Create a SimpleDbOpCTest:  ```java @ContextConfiguration({""base.xml"", ""A.xml""}) ```  - Each test is annotated with `@Transactional`, calling the `SimpleDbOpService` and verifying the DB operation results at the end of test method; - `` in `base.xml`, also add ""transactionManager"" definition in - Create a test suite class as the following:  ```java      import org.junit.runner.RunWith;     import org.junit.runners.Suite;          @RunWith(Suite.class)     @Suite.SuiteClasses({       SimpleDbOpATest.class,       SimpleDbOpBTest.class,       SimpleDbOpCTest.class     })     public class Debug {          } ```  - The tests in `SimpleDbOpCTest` will fail.  ----  ## Root Cause  In the Test Framework, it creates one instance of `ApplicationContext` for each ""Set of context locations"" and caches (and switches) the ApplicationContext instances by ""context locations"". Among all those `ApplicationContext` instances, the instance of `AnnotationTransactionAspect` is shared. That is, during the test suite running, there will be only one instance of `AnnotationTransactionAspect`, no matter how many `ApplicationContext` instances created.  A reference to `BeanFactory` (in spring 3.0.0.RC) or `transactionManager` (in spring 2.5.6) will be injected into `AnnotationTransactionAspect` (derived from `TransactionAspectSupport`) while the `ApplicationContext` being loaded.  In the example above, test A and C have the exactly same context locations, and they will share the same application context instance when running in a test suite. So, when running tests A, B, and C in a suite and in that order, the application context instance switches from A to B to A. However, the `transactionManager` instance (retrieved from an instance of `AnnotationTransactionAspect`) will be A, B, and B (**should be A though**), because there is only one instance of `AnnotationTransactionAspect` per class loader. In turn, that causes the operations in the `C.testXxx()` be split in to two `transactionManager` instances, one from `AnnotationTransactionAspect` and the other from `ApplicationContext`. Therefore, the DB result verification fails.  ## Proposed Solution  To create one Aspect instance per `ApplicationContext`, not per class loader. Not sure if that's achievable though.  ## Further Resources  - [Spring Test Context Caching + AspectJ @Transactional + Ehcache pain](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/04/spring-test-context-caching-aspectj-transactional-ehcache-pain.html) blog by Java Code Geeks  ## Related Issues  - #11897 - #17123 - #10789 - #12619  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6, 3.0.5  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=79949  5 votes, 7 watchers","open","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-11-13T07:16:57Z","2022-03-20T13:30:16Z"

But the method NEVER looks for the JRDataSource under the ""reportDataKey"". Instead this lookup is done in the ""fillReport"" method, which's javadoc seems also to be out of date.

It consists out of:  * A row mapper which wraps results in an immutable value object which denotes a value as value, error or last. This row mapper puts results into a blocking queue. * A blocking iterable which consumes from a blocking queue, either yields a value on it's iterators next(), returns false for hasNext() or throws an error if a throwable is wrapped. * A ParameterizedRowMapper compatible interface for the generation of values / row.  This could make a useful addition to the already existing query options for SimpleJdbcTemplate if there is no use case for Spring Batch and a decoupling of row production and consumption is desired and/or the handling of large result sets via a lazy iterator is convenient.  Support for multiple consumers could easily be added.  There are no dependencies (except a very replaceable on for Google Collections) other than SE 5+.

This works fine and correctly introduces the interface (IntroducedInterface.class) and creates the proxy.  The problem is that when DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBeanNamesForType(IntroducedInterface.class) is called an empty string[] is returned. I remotely debugged tomcat and it looks like there may be a bug in AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.predictBeanType(). The method getBeanNamesForType() delegates to this method to seemingly attempt to predict what class a specific bean would be after all post processors have been applied.  Here is the code snippet from AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.predictBeanType:  ``` protected Class predictBeanType(String beanName, RootBeanDefinition mbd, Class[] typesToMatch) { 		Class beanClass = null; 		if (mbd.getFactoryMethodName() != null) { 			beanClass = getTypeForFactoryMethod(beanName, mbd, typesToMatch); 		} 		else { 			beanClass = resolveBeanClass(mbd, beanName, typesToMatch);  		// Apply SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessors to predict the 		// eventual type after a before-instantiation shortcut. 		if (beanClass != null && !mbd.isSynthetic() && hasInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessors()) { 			for (Iterator it = getBeanPostProcessors().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) { 				BeanPostProcessor bp = (BeanPostProcessor) it.next(); 				if (bp instanceof SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor) { 					SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor ibp = (SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor) bp; 					Class processedType = ibp.predictBeanType(beanClass, beanName); 					if (processedType != null) { 						return processedType; 					} 				} 			} 		} 		return beanClass; 	} ```  And here is the snippet from AbstractAutoProxyCreator:  ``` public Class predictBeanType(Class beanClass, String beanName) { 		Object cacheKey = getCacheKey(beanClass, beanName); 		return (Class) this.proxyTypes.get(cacheKey); 	} ```  The only place a key is ever added to proxyTypes is in AbstractAutoProxyCreator.postProcessBeforeInstantiation:  ``` public Object postProcessBeforeInstantiation(Class beanClass, String beanName) throws BeansException { 		Object cacheKey = getCacheKey(beanClass, beanName);  		if (!this.targetSourcedBeans.contains(cacheKey)) { 			if (this.advisedBeans.contains(cacheKey) || this.nonAdvisedBeans.contains(cacheKey)) { 				return null; 			} 			if (isInfrastructureClass(beanClass, beanName) || shouldSkip(beanClass, beanName)) { 				this.nonAdvisedBeans.add(cacheKey); 				return null; 			} 		}  		// Create proxy here if we have a custom TargetSource. 		// Suppresses unnecessary default instantiation of the target bean: 		// The TargetSource will handle target instances in a custom fashion. 		TargetSource targetSource = getCustomTargetSource(beanClass, beanName); 		if (targetSource != null) { 			this.targetSourcedBeans.add(beanName); 			Object[] specificInterceptors = getAdvicesAndAdvisorsForBean(beanClass, beanName, targetSource); 			Object proxy = createProxy(beanClass, beanName, specificInterceptors, targetSource); 			[B]this.proxyTypes.put(cacheKey, proxy.getClass());[/B] 			return proxy; 		}  		return null; 	} ```  This means that beans would never have its final class predicted correctly unless it is already instantiated! This means that only beans instantiated prior to a bean that calls getBeanNamesForType() would be returned correctly. Does this make this whole process useless?  Also if you look at AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.predictBeanType if any of the SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessors returns a non null value all other post processors that may have affected the class type (introduced interfaces, replaced with instance of different class etc.) would not have had a chance (the method does not consider order), again leading to incorrect results.  This seems to be a bug.  This also prevents MBeanExporter from being able to export beans based on interfaces that were introduced on beans.

Having two entities and a controller:  ```java @Entity public class Child {   // ... }  @Entity public class Parent {   @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)   public Set children = new HashSet();   // ... }  @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT) public String update(@Valid Parent parent, BindingResult result, ModelMap modelMap) {   for(Child child : parent.getChildren()) { // ! this throws        } } ```  The Parent class has no static method findParent(Long id) that the IdToEntityConverter could use to convert a string to a Child entity. So the conversion service tries its best to convert the info in the http request back into the HashSet ""children"", but inserts wrong elements into this collection. The result of the children collection is:  ``` children = {   new HashSet {     ""selectedId"",     ""otherSelectedId""   } } ```  So instead of putting a Child entitiy with a given id into the set, the conversion service put another hashset with a string element into it.

The problem comes from the UnicastRemoteObject constructor that automatically exports the bean, by default on port 0 (and the nature of UnicastRemoteObject forbids an instance to be exported more than once).  There are two possible workarounds for that in the forum reference, but they both boil down to a simple thing: calling the UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(Remote, boolean) on the bean before attempting to export it with the parameters from Spring.  For a true fix, I would put the additional lines in the RmiServiceExporter.prepare() method.  I don't believe it would be useful to add a configuration parameter for that.

Each BeanFactory has its own TransactionManager (and its own SessionFactory and DataSource). Even if i annotate all `@Transactional` Annotations with a qualifier like described in the docs, it does not work.  This is because TransactionAspectSupport.determineTransactionManager(TransactionAttribute txAttr) relies on a beanFactory reference for resolving a matching transactionManager. But transactionAspectSupport is a singleton aspect. So we have two beanFactories but only one instance of TransactionAspectSupport. So when i load my second beanFactory TransactionAspectSupport.setBeanFactory is called again and the initial beanFactory reference is lost.  this could be prevented if TransactionAspectSupport has a set of beanFactories and iterating over them when searching for a matching qualifier.

In general this may be acceptable, but in the case of using both `@Transactional` and `@Async` on a method, this order does not work.  The transaction is started on the caller thread and does not apply to the async execution thread.  As a simple example of where this applies, consider the following interface method:  `@Async` `@Transactional`(readOnly=false, propagation=Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) void createAuditEvent(CreateAuditEventData data);  Creation of the audit event should not block normal program flow execution, hence `@Async`.  And the method is a single DB Transaction, hence `@Transactional`.  A quick fix for this issue is to force the async advisor into position 0 in the advisor chain, or at least a position before the transaction advisor.  A more robust fix would be to allow order to be specified, similar to how order can be placed on the .

In order to add Beans (a `@RemotingDestination`) a sub-context is created as the target for: setParent(rootAppCtx); register(clazz); refresh(); getBean(beanName); In the case cited, an AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.  When refresh(), the clazz with `@Service` `@RemotingDestination` `@Scope`(value=""flexclient"", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS) proceeds to AbstractBeanFactory.java line 320: which attempts to find the requested scope, but looks only in the current/child ApplicationContext, failing to find the Scope in the parent.  The proposed fix is to add a method (near line 779, after getRegisteredScope()) something like:      protected Scope getScopeUseParent(String scopeName) {         BeanFactory beanFactory = this;         Scope scope = this.scopes.get(scopeName);         while ((scope == null)                && (beanFactory instanceof HierarchicalBeanFactory)                && ((beanFactory = ((HierarchicalBeanFactory)beanFactory).getParentBeanFactory()) != null)                 && (beanFactory instanceof AbstractBeanFactory)) {             scope = ((AbstractBeanFactory)beanFactory).scopes.get(scopeName);         }         return scope;                   // which may be null...     }  And use     Scope scope = getScopeUsingParents(scopeName); instead of: Scope scope = this.scopes.get(scopeName); In the appropriate places in AbstractBeanFactory.java  [Documentation may need to be upgraded to warn non-AbstractBeanFactory implementations that they should also search the parents to find registered Scopes.]  Note: for my project this is a ""Major"" ""Blocker"" Priority and requires a source-level patch and class replacement. but having upgraded the AbstractBeanFactory.class, i'm back in business until next release. I respect the fact that it is apparently not a common requirement, (it has gone this long without complaint) but would appreciate a supported solution when possible.  Environmental Impact: The suggested fix is ""benign"" (has little effect on existing/working apps), as all of them apparently register and access custom Scopes in the same appCtx. That is: the new while loop only runs before or in place of existing code that throws an Exception. So at worst: existing code that relied on not finding a Scope might fail to get an Exception.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showpost.php?p=294224&postcount=13","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-12T05:47:00Z","2015-09-22T17:34:32Z"

After deploying the application, I visit my testpage with the parameter set in the querystring, and Spring injects the parameter. If I change the parameter it changes in my controller and if I remove it, Spring injects a null value. This is what I expected. Creating new sessions doesn't change this behaviour.  If however, I visit my testpage with no parameter set at all, Spring does not inject the value (not even a null value) and ignores the `@Value` annotation completely for as long as the application remains running. Even if I include the parameter in the querystring it still doesn't get injected.  Is this correct behaviour? It almost seems like an optimisation mechanism that checks if the value referenced by the expression language resolves to null. If the value is null at the time it is first injected, the setter method is never called.

However, in ConstructorArgumentValues (and maybe other places), when the argument values are copied, the code for ValueHolder.copy is: public ValueHolder copy() { ValueHolder copy = new ValueHolder(this.value, this.type, this.name); copy.setSource(this.source); return copy; }  But when this.value is not an immutable value, but a TypedStringValue, then the reference is used as is. Which means if it is changed in the original bean definition it will also change in the clone.  Suggestions: 1. when cloning value types, see if they implement a certain interface (Cloneable may not be good since by default Object.clone performs shallow cloning). If so, call the interface method. If not, only allow primitive types and error/warn otherwise. 2. classes that represent values, like TypedStringValue should be immutable. so no setValue method. this probably is harder to implement but may result in safer cloning semantics.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-12T19:41:51Z","2015-09-22T17:34:36Z"

I then filled the Map with the IN parameter value for P_STATION, leaving P_CHECK_ID as null, and called execute on the function.  Result: P_STATION's value is never set before passing it to the function. Tracing it from inside the database shows its value is NULL. If not modified within the stored function, it remains NULL, and thus loses its original value.  Changing the parameter type of P_STATION from IN OUT to IN and declaring it as SqlParameter makes everything work as it should, so I'm assuming it's an oversight for this special case.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6","closed","status: invalid,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-14T02:10:56Z","2019-01-12T05:32:42Z"

However, it doesn't work for me in Spring app - the validation is not called, I must call it explicitly (I don't use `@Valid-marked` controller inputs, becuase it doesn't fit well our needs. We call Spring DataBinder explicitly, and we have to call it's validate() method to trigger Hibernate Validator to run). Why validation is not triggered by Hibernate automatically? Is it something specific to Spring environment, perhaps it is disabled intentionally (e.g. to not duplicate validation after validating controller inputs)? Or it's Hibernate bug?

The problem is Grails data binder is still doing the right thing in this regard, but when it passes of control the super impl it doesn't have this additional knowledge so its creating the nested object graphs which breaks Grails' data binding.

This Factory handles one Timer per ScheduledTimerTask in order to avoid a serialization of the Task execution.

The usual behaviour to deal with this situation is to retry some time later (e.g. 1s).  I think this is something that could be handled by a framework like Spring. Therefore, I suggest some additional properties for the `@Transactional` annotation:  -deadlockRetryAttempts: The number of attempts a deadlock is retried, before throwing an Exception -deadlockRetryInterval: The number of milliseconds between retries -deadlockExceptionClass: Since the specific deadlock Exception is dependent upon the JDBC-driver, you can specify the Exception that represents a deadlock, this does not have to be the ""outer"" Exception, but it can be in the cause-hierarchy too.  A complete example of such an annotation would be the following:  `@Transactional`( isolation=Isolation.SERIALIZABLE, propagation=Propagation.REQUIRED, readOnly=false, deadlockRetryAttempts=5, deadlockRetryInterval=1000, deadlockExceptionClass=WhatEverException.class)   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2010-03-19T05:33:50Z","2019-01-12T03:50:27Z"

The issue seems to be caused by changes in Spring that result in the calling of XA transaction commands that the MySQL server does not support. This did not happen before Spring 2.5.6 and I tried ONLY upgrading Spring and not Hibernate or Atomikos. After the problem occurred I then upgraded Hibernate and Atomikos and the problem remained.

The channel starts the listener, which processes the session and consumer establishment on a separate thread; start() returns after waking that thread. There is, therefore, a race condition where the client of the channel can send message(s) before the topic is subscribed to. These message(s) will be lost.  We need the ability in the channel to block sends until the listener has subscribed; one way to achieve this would be an API (or a callback) on the listener to determine if the consumer has been created.  It is not clear how prevalent this issue would be in the ""real"" world, but it causes sporadic failures of unit tests.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/218ee6d24c991f841ee91085c2bb26d6198db8c6","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-03T03:16:18Z","2012-06-19T03:43:25Z"

I would like to use a different error code (i.e. the message template), since I have constraints that use a single annotation but can have different messages to show to the user (depending on the actual content of the property).  At the moment I see no way to control this, except by post-processing the validation result of the LocalValidatorFactoryBean, which is not really what I want to do.  From my perspective using the annotation's simple name (which is what the code does today) as the errorCode in the FieldError is really just wrong: it loses the information provided in the constraint when it selected a messageTemplate (i.e. JSR-303 gives flexibility to have multiple messages from a single constraint and Spring removes that information).

Supplying a default value implicitly sets #required to false. ```  And because the defaultValue is by set at **""""** by default I need to set manually **required = false**  ``` @RequestMapping(""/updateForm"") public void updateForm(@RequestParam(value=""accountId"",required=false,defaultValue="""") Account account, Model model) {   assert account != null; } ```  The behavior I get is the following :  * /updateForm?accountId=xxx : passes * /updateForm : assertion exception raised  Therefore, either `@RequestParam` default value should be **null** or the HandlerMethodInvoker class should handle the **""""** default value as follows (in the _resolveRequestParam_ method)  ``` if (paramValue == null) {   if (StringUtils.hasText(defaultValue)) {     paramValue = resolveDefaultValue(defaultValue);   }   else if (required) {     raiseMissingParameterException(paramName, paramType);   }   paramValue = checkValue(paramName, paramValue, paramType); } ```  When requesting a default value at """", it should probably be  ``` if (paramValue == null) { --> if (!required) {     paramValue = resolveDefaultValue(defaultValue);   }   else {     raiseMissingParameterException(paramName, paramType);   }   paramValue = checkValue(paramName, paramValue, paramType); } ```  `@RequestParam`, `@CookieValue` and `@RequestHeader` share the same behavior for default values.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Issue Links:** - #11544 An optional `@RequestParam` parameter of an `@InitBinder` method is filled with garbarge instead of null, if the corresponding parameter is missing on the URL  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/97059f4e18da89106ea02d218e3f97a649162ddc  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-02T12:21:13Z","2019-01-13T07:55:39Z"

After 4 days of debugging I have found the cause. TilesConfigurer uses SpringTilesContainerFactory which extends BasicTilesContainerFactory. The problem is in createDefinitionsFactory method.  SpringTilesContainerFactory: `@Override` protected DefinitionsFactory createDefinitionsFactory(TilesApplicationContext applicationContext, TilesRequestContextFactory contextFactory, LocaleResolver resolver) { if (definitionsFactoryClass != null) { return BeanUtils.instantiate(definitionsFactoryClass); } else { return super.createDefinitionsFactory(applicationContext, contextFactory, resolver); } }  BasicTilesContainerFactory:      /**      * Creates the definitions factory.

"","11827","Allow localization of formating errors messages using an AnnotationFormatterFactory and multiple custom annotations applied over the same type [SPR-7168]","**[Eduardo Rodrigues](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=duardor)** opened **[SPR-7168](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-7168?redirect=false)** and commented  Today is possible to define custom error messages for binding errors defining a key in the format ""typeMismatch.typeOfProperty"". Example: for a bean property of type java.util.Date you can define the following message in a message property file:  ```java typeMismatch.java.util.Date={0} must be a valid date! ```  This message will be used by the tag form:error when the bind fails for a property of type java.util.Date.  I'd like to ask for an improvement of this feature. With spring 3 new ConversionService I can use an AnnotationFormatterFactory and create some custom annotations to apply in the same property type. Example: mypackage.DateFormat and mypackage.DateTimeFormat, both annotations to be applied in properties of type java.util.Date This way my java.util.Date properties would be annotated in my bean like the following:  ```java public class MyBean{        @DateFormat    private Date aDateField;     @DateTimeFormat    private Date aDateTimeField;  } ```  So my custom ConversionService using my custom AnnotationFormatterFactory will format/parse the property ""aDateField"" according to one rule based on the presence of `@DateFormat` and will format/parse the property ""aDateTimeField"" based on the presence of `@DateTimeFormat`. This is working wonderfully well right now but I have a problem with the errors messages when the bind fails.  The MessageCodesResolver interface is responsible for ""creating"" the possible codes which will be used to translate the message. The interface is defined as:  ```java |borderStyle=solid} public interface MessageCodesResolver {  	/** 	 * Build message codes for the given error code and object name. 	 * Used for building the codes list of an ObjectError. 	 * @param errorCode the error code used for rejecting the object 	 * @param objectName the name of the object 	 * @return the message codes to use 	 */ 	String[] resolveMessageCodes(String errorCode, String objectName);  	/** 	 * Build message codes for the given error code and field specification. 	 * Used for building the codes list of an FieldError. 	 * @param errorCode the error code used for rejecting the value 	 * @param objectName the name of the object 	 * @param field the field name 	 * @param fieldType the field type (may be null if not determinable) 	 * @return the message codes to use 	 */ 	String[] resolveMessageCodes(String errorCode, String objectName, String field, Class fieldType);  } ```  With this interface is impossible to determine at runtime if the bean property is annotated or not. I think this interface (and the callers of this interface) must be revised. I would like to create a message with the key ""typeMismatch.myAnnotationClass"". Example:  ```java |borderStyle=solid} typeMismatch.mypackage.DateFormat={0} must be a valid date! typeMismatch.mypackage.DateTimeFormat={0} must be a valid date and time! ```  Today this limitation is a pain for using the new ConversionService and multiple annotations used in bean properties of the same type because you can have only one message for the type (in the example, typeMismatch.java.util.Date) or you have to create a message for each property in the format typeMysmatch.beanName.property.  Thank you very much, hope my text is clear enough!   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=88442","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-04T04:59:26Z","2018-12-27T11:10:06Z"

However, `@Named` is just an example for an `@Qualifier` annotated Annotation. The JavaDoc for `@Qualifier` states that the specification only covers using such annotations on fields and methods, classes are optional. So even though this behavior does not contradict the specification it is not required either.  But if `@Named` means that a class is implemented by context:component-scan the same should work for my own `@Qualifier` annotated Annotation as well. That is not the case.  Also a class annotated with `@Singleton` is not instantiated by context:component-scan and probably other Annotations that are marked with `@Scope` work the same way. I think it would be more logical to have these annotations work with context:component-scan than the `@Named` annotation as they clearly belong to implementation classes which `@Named` does not. But again this is not covered by the spec.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC2  1 votes, 3 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-11-27T21:42:15Z","2012-06-19T03:43:04Z"

That's cool but may be significantly improved because current implementation doesn't check generic argument type.  Suppose the following simple example:  ``` public class AbstractTestClass { }  @Component public class TestClass1 extends AbstractTestClass { }  @Component public class TestClass2 extends AbstractTestClass { }  @Component public class GenericTest {      private AbstractTestClass[] intArray;     private AbstractTestClass[] stringArray;     private List intList;     private List stringList;     private Map intMap;     private Map stringMap;     private AbstractTestClass intField;     private AbstractTestClass stringField;      public AbstractTestClass[] getIntArray() {         return intArray;     }      @Autowired     public void setIntArray(AbstractTestClass[] intArray) {         this.intArray = intArray;     }      public AbstractTestClass[] getStringArray() {         return stringArray;     }      @Autowired     public void setStringArray(AbstractTestClass[] stringArray) {         this.stringArray = stringArray;     }      public List getIntList() {         return intList;     }      @Autowired     public void setIntList(List intList) {         this.intList = intList;     }      public List getStringList() {         return stringList;     }      @Autowired     public void setStringList(List stringList) {         this.stringList = stringList;     }      public Map getIntMap() {         return intMap;     }      @Autowired     public void setIntMap(Map intMap) {         this.intMap = intMap;     }      public Map getStringMap() {         return stringMap;     }      @Autowired     public void setStringMap(Map stringMap) {         this.stringMap = stringMap;     }      public AbstractTestClass getIntField() {         return intField;     }      @Autowired     public void setIntField(AbstractTestClass intField) {         this.intField = intField;     }      public AbstractTestClass getStringField() {         return stringField;     }      @Autowired     public void setStringField(AbstractTestClass stringField) {         this.stringField = stringField;     } } ```  We would like the framework to detect that target _'GenericTest'_ autowired properties define generic type as an argument and inject only the beans that apply to it (_'TestClass1'_ or _'TestClass2'_ objects respectively).

It contains two main parts: 1. mini-framework that alloww    * Derive generic type against target generic class/interface;    * Check if particular type may be used as another type; 2.

However, there is a possible use-case that a user wants to define particular order for autowired collection/array. It looks obvious in the case of autowiring typed lists (the client may want to preserve particular order for the list elements) but the same idea may be spread easily to sets/maps/arrays.  I suggest the following rules to be used during examining the order for two elements: * if both classes of compared object are marked by [Ordered](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html) the one with lower value is considered to be less than another; * if class of one element is marked by [Ordered](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html) and class of another is not marked by [Ordered](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html) the former is considered to be less than the later; * if both classes of compared elements are not marked by [Ordered](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html) but implement [Comparable](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html) with consisting type parameter they are compared via [Comparable#compareTo(Object)](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T));  Please note that the rules above may be applied to all elements of autowired collection/array in order to define particular for them.  **Implementation**  That feature may be optional and defaults to perform ordering. It seems that most natural to allow to define it via additional method of [@Autowired](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html) annotation.

For example if an application requires both Excel and PDF renderings of the logical view name ""view"", the corresponding bean names would be ""view.xls"" and ""view.pdf"".  CNVR currently does not support this pattern since it only tries to resolve ""view""  The proposed enhancement uses the mediaTypes map (or JAF in some cases) to obtain the file extension.  The request can use path extension, accept header, or request parameter containing the extension.  The mediaTypes map is reversed searched to obtain the file extension corresponding to each requested media type (Accept header can specify multiple types).  A second pass is made through the view resolvers appending ""."" + file extension to the view name  A patch is attached    ---  **Attachments:** - [ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.diff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16489/ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.diff) (_1.40 kB_) - [ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.diff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16470/ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.diff) (_1.29 kB_) - [ContentNegotiatingViewResolverTests.diff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16471/ContentNegotiatingViewResolverTests.diff) (_5.12 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-21T21:04:03Z","2012-06-19T03:44:18Z"

No extension, or .html should resolve to the TilesView. This works, however any non-html extension, e.g., /accounts.foo also renders an Excel document . This happens because the JAF file types map returns a media type of ""application/octet-stream"" for arbitrary file extensions. Thus the defaultContentType is suppressed.  \ \  \ \ \			 \ \   \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ The proposed solution is to add an ignoreJafFileTypes property.

However, I realized the only reason I assigned IDs to the `url`, and `urlConnection` beans is so that I could reference them using the `factory-bean` attribute.  (Likewise, the only reason the `writer` bean had an ID, is so that it could be referenced by a `` tag.)  All three top-level beans are only referenced in one place each; never anywhere else.  A small part of me likes the idea of nesting beans that are only ever referenced in one place, so as not to pollute my bean definitions with top-level beans.  A nested `` tag (which would be mutually exclusive with the `factory-bean` attribute) would do the trick nicely.  With it I could rewrite the above as:  ```xml     ...                                                                                        ...   ```  The attributes and content of the `` tag would be the same as the `` tag, except it wouldn't allow the `scope`, `id`, or `name` attributes.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6, 3.0 RC1  1 votes, 1 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-10-22T07:50:00Z","2018-12-28T10:17:26Z"

Karr](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dkarr)** opened **[SPR-6851](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6851?redirect=false)** and commented  I've been experimenting with trying to enable autodetection of JMX mbeans in my Spring context.  Although I've had no trouble explicitly listing my mbeans in the ""beans"" property in the context, that's not quite optimal.  I'm seeing more issues than the subject line describes, but I think they are issues with interpreting how this thing is supposed to work.  It could be that all of the issues I'm seeing are just documentation problems, but I can't tell for certain.  I'm using the `@Managed`... annotations in the bean class to specify the JMX attributes.  I'd prefer to have them there than in the context.  The only one that's somewhat questionable is the mbean name.  I think I would want to set the ""name="" part, but not the part before it (I'm not certain what the JMX-specific terms are for those pieces).  For instance, in my class I currently have:  objectName = ""springjmxbug:name=logBean""  it seems reasonable to set ""logBean"" in the class, but I think ""springjmxbug"" would be better set in the context.  Despite the other questions about how this is supposed to work, in my testing, I've been unable to find an arrangement where autodetection will work, but it's entirely possible I'm misinterpreting how it's supposed to work.  For instance, here's a short excerpt from my context:  ---                                                                                                                                  ---  Here's my ""Log4JManager"" class:  ---  `@ManagedResource`(objectName = ""springjmxbug:name=logBean"", description = ""Bean for controlling Log4J levels in DynamicContent"") public class Log4JManager { `@ManagedOperation`(description = ""Set a Log4J logging level for a specific category (package)"") `@ManagedOperationParameters`({ `@ManagedOperationParameter`(name = ""packageName"", description = ""Log4J category name""), `@ManagedOperationParameter`(name = ""level"", description = ""Log4J level"") }) public void setLogLevel(String packageName, String level) { LogManager.getLogger(packageName).setLevel(Level.toLevel(level)); }      @ManagedOperation(description = ""Get a Log4J logging level for a specific category (package)"")     @ManagedOperationParameters({         @ManagedOperationParameter(name = ""packageName"", description = ""Log4J category name"")     })     public String getLogLevel(String packageName) {         return LogManager.getLogger(packageName).getLevel().toString();     }  }  ---  If I comment out the ""beans"" property, I get this very confusing error message:  ""Unable to register MBean [springjmxbug.Log4JManager@1ad637e] with key 'logManager'; nested exception is javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException: Key properties cannot be empty""  Looking at the section in the doc that covers this, there is the following example:  ---  \ \ \ \  ---  There are a couple of confusing elements here.  First, ""autodetect"" is set to true, but right there is the definition of the bean.  If this is what is intended, then the meaning of ""autodetect"" is very different from what it means in the rest of Spring.  Second, the definition of this bean using class ""org.springframework.jmx.export.TestDynamicMBean"" is odd, as there's no such class.

In order to achieve that, we have to explicitly add each exception to the rollbackFor property on the `@Transactional` declaration.  For example:  `@Transactional`(readOnly = false, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW, rollbackFor = {MyException.class, HisException.class}) public void updateFoo(Foo foo) throws MyException, HisException{ // do something }  Now if we want to add an additional exception to the throws clause and also have it included in the rollBackFor, we have to add the exception in both places:  For example:  `@Transactional`(readOnly = false, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW, rollbackFor = {MyException.class, HisException.class, HerException.class}) public void updateFoo(Foo foo) throws MyException, HisException, HerException{ // do something }  I think it would be a great addition to have the ability to set rollbackFor=checked or something similar, so that if we change the throws clause of the method, the rollbackFor would automatically pick up the changes.

Consider the following example:  ``` @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED, rollbackFor = MyException.class, timeout = 600) public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {    public Foo getFoo(String fooName) {     // do something   }    // these settings have precedence for this method @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW) public void updateFoo(Foo foo) {     // do something   } } ```  At the class level, we have defined what we hoped would be the defaults for all methods within the class. For the method updateFoo(), we need to change the propagation level to REQUIRES_NEW, but want to re-use the defaults that have already been specified at the class level. So we added the `@Transactional` meta-data on the method. Once we have added just the propagation level to the method, we lose rollbackFor and timeout properties set at the class level - there is no form of inheritance.  As a result, you must include all additional properties again on the method, the properties defined at the class level are completely ignored. The result of this is that we have to redundantly copy the properties onto the `@Transactional` declaration for every method from the class in order to retain them, which is unfortunate.  What we were hoping for, was to be able to simply change the rollbackFor by appending an additional Exception at the class level and have all methods, only those with the `@Transactional` annotation that did not explicitly set the rollbackFor property, benefit from the change via inheritance. Instead, we would have to go back and systematically add the change to every method explicitly, instead of simply appending it to the rollbackFor property of the `@Transactional` annotation at the class level.  I can see that maybe this could introduce some problems with backwards compatibility. So, maybe Spring could introduce an additional property on the `@Transactional` annotation like: 'inherit=true', which would then signal that any unset properties should be inherited from the next higher level. So, if the method set the inherit=true property, then it should inherit any unset properties from the class. If the class has not set a property, then it would inherit from the TransactionManager defaults as expected.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  2 votes, 4 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-07T06:45:52Z","2020-01-06T13:09:39Z"

By default, the DestinationResolver implementation is a DynamicDestinationResolver which does a good job of creating a javax.jms.Destination based on the String value passed in as the ""destination"".  However, most of the time, I don't want to hardcode the destination name in the place where I'm creating the jms:listener. I want to have the destination name string stored off in another configuration file.  To acheive this, I can use an org.springframework.jms.support.destination.BeanFactoryDestinationResolver, but this requires a javax.jms.Destination as an input rather than a String. I want to just be able to configure a String rather than a Destination; you often need access to a JMS Session in order to create a Destination object, which is something I want done at runtime when the bean configurations are being loaded.  To solve the problem, I have implemented my own DestinationResolver which just: * Interprets the ""destination"" as a bean identifier rather than a hardcoded name. * Looks up the bean identifier and insists that it's a String. * Uses a DynamicDestinationResolver (which I've subclassed) to lookup the Destination.  I'd have thought that this would be a common use case. It would be great to have a ""destination-ref"" attribute on jms:listener (that **must** point to a String bean) that would essentially do what my custom DestinationResolver does.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6, 3.0.2","closed","status: invalid,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-22T21:31:59Z","2019-01-12T05:32:08Z"

Example:  ```  ```  will aways work, but  ```  ```  will fail if the classpath is configured in a particular way, even if there is only one file that matches (foo.xml).  The problem is that the classpath can contain the package ""test"" in more than one location (e.g. target/classes and target/test-classes) and without a pattern the search continues through all of them, but with a pattern it stops when the first one is reached, even if no resource is found.  A less surprising outcome would be if the **first** resource that matches on the classpath was returned, instead of no resource at all.

This causes a NPE as other internal spring BeanPostProcessor's do not correctly handle a null value.  Is this a bug or are we doing something wrong?  For example the org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor#postProcessBeforeInitialization does not validate the bean, attempting to call 'bean.getClass()' which causes a NPE.  Should it not prevent running other post processors if the bean has been nulled? i.e.:  ``` 	public Object applyBeanPostProcessorsBeforeInitialization(Object existingBean, String beanName) 			throws BeansException {  		Object result = existingBean; 		for (BeanPostProcessor beanProcessor : getBeanPostProcessors()) { 			if (result == null) return; 			result = beanProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization(result, beanName); 		} 		return result; 	} ```  Also can someone confirm that the org.springframework.core.Ordered interface works for BeanPostProcessor.

I think SmartLifecycle will gradually be used by those spring-powered framework to auto-start their components, and Spring already uses it in its core framework, e.g. SchedulerFactoryBean, SimpleMessageListenerContainer and JmsMessageEndpointManager. And also, I notice that all components choose Integer.MAX_VALUE (lowest priority) as their phase.  I think the question is how can people choose a correct phase when they develop their own component. Can Spring provide a recommendation in its documentation?  Let me give one use case: I have one application which has three SmartLifecycle components, HttpClient, DataSyncService, TCPServer. The start order of my application would be: 1. Start HttpClient 2. Start DataSyncService to sync data from an exteranl HTTP service via HttpClient, and then update its DB. 3. Start TCPServer to accept requests    The issue is that both HttpClient and TCPServer are provided by 3rd party so they do not know which phase is the correct one, so they may have a same phase. The worse thing would be that TCPServer have a higher order than HttpClient/DataSyncService, that means TCPServer will get started before DataSyncService refreshes its data, and it can return some out-of-date data to the client while Spring is starting DataSyncService.  In order to avoid this issue, I think Spring framework is the right place to give some recommendations about the right phase for different compoents. It does not enforce people to use it, but it does give the idea about what kind of number people may choose for different components. For example, in our code, we give some recommand phases below so that people can choose a right phase for their own compoennt:  |Component|SmartLifecycle.getPhase()| |ServerTransports|3,000,000| |CacheManager|1,750,000| |Datasources|1,500,000| |Pool|1,250,000| |ClientTransports|1,000,000|  Is it possible that Spring can give the similiar recommandation in its doc so that all developers can get a general idea about which phase can be use?  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA","open","type: documentation,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-05T00:30:43Z","2019-01-13T21:47:40Z"

Stach II](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=cstach)** opened **[SPR-6895](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6895?redirect=false)** and commented  When JpaTransactionManager gets a handle for the Hibernate session's connection in doBegin with      ConnectionHandle conHandle = getJpaDialect().getJdbcConnection(em, definition.isReadOnly());  it never actually lets go. JpaTransactionManager eventually calls      getJpaDialect().releaseJdbcConnection(txObject.getConnectionHolder().getConnectionHandle(),     					txObject.getEntityManagerHolder().getEntityManager());  in doCleanupAfterCompletion, but HibernateJpaDialect has no implementation for releaseJdbcConnection.  Because this borrowed connection handle is never released, o.h.jdbc.ConnectionManager never returns the connection to the pool.  This setup eventually turns into a connection leak with Spring Web Flow when Hibernate fetches more connections to instantiate lazy collections and such, but the connection handles in the pool never get closed. Even if your database times out the connections and your pool eventually figures that out, the handles are still out of the pool until then.  After turning on debug logging for o.h.jdbc.ConnectionManager, things look like this:  $ grep jdbc.ConnectionManager debug.log | cut -c22- | sort | uniq -c 1 c.ConnectionManager.getConnection(ConnectionManager.java:167) 1 c.ConnectionManager.openConnection(ConnectionManager.java:446) 160 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager aggressively releasing JDBC connection 157 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager opening JDBC connection 156 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager releasing JDBC connection [ (open PreparedStatements: 0, globally: 0) (open ResultSets: 0, globally: 0)] 1 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager skipping aggresive-release due to borrowed connection  156 + 1 skipped release (and the two lines from the stack trace when the connection times out in the connection pool) = 157 opens.  $ grep jdbc.ConnectionManager debug.log | cut -c22- | sort | uniq -c 3 c.ConnectionManager.getConnection(ConnectionManager.java:167) 3 c.ConnectionManager.openConnection(ConnectionManager.java:446) 256 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager aggressively releasing JDBC connection 251 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager opening JDBC connection 248 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager releasing JDBC connection [ (open PreparedStatements: 0, globally: 0) (open ResultSets: 0, globally: 0)] 3 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager skipping aggresive-release due to borrowed connection  Again, 248 + 3 = 251.  Now, I don't see a need to have this JDBC connection even associated with the transaction as I do everything through JPA. I may be wrong about that, but it seems to only be used in this one spot. I went ahead and subclassed HibernateJpaDialect and made getJdbcConnection return null, just like DefaultJpaDialect. Things seem to be working, also (two separate runs):  $ grep jdbc.ConnectionManager debug.log | cut -c22- | sort | uniq -c 99 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager aggressively releasing JDBC connection 95 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager opening JDBC connection 95 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager releasing JDBC connection [ (open PreparedStatements: 0, globally: 0) (open ResultSets: 0, globally: 0)]  $ grep jdbc.ConnectionManager debug.log | cut -c22- | sort | uniq -c 165 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager aggressively releasing JDBC connection 161 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager opening JDBC connection 161 DEBUG jdbc.ConnectionManager releasing JDBC connection [ (open PreparedStatements: 0, globally: 0) (open ResultSets: 0, globally: 0)]  The numbers match up and I am no longer getting timed out connections in the pool, which means I also shouldn't be running out of connections.  This should probably either be fixed, or this whole JDBC connection transaction association should be optional.

"","11561","Issue with Circular Reference when using a FactoryBean [SPR-6896]","**[Christian Marquez Grabia](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=chalmagr)** opened **[SPR-6896](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6896?redirect=false)** and commented  There is a very specific issue when resolving circular reference in which the order of the beans is crucial, however while debugging this, there may be a possible way to avoid this, which is 'postponing' the call to 'FactoryBean.getObject()' when the factory has not being 'initialized' yet, but post-injecting the values once the factory gets initialized (afterPropertiesSet).  Basically, this issue happens in the next scenario:  == Java Classes ==  public class TestClassImpl implements TestClass {      private String string;     private TestClass testClass;          // setters & getters  }  == Spring Context == \ \ \ \           	     	       \  The issue comes up when the factory gets 'pre-instantiated' to avoid circular references, and the target bean attempts to use it. Since it is a factory bean it will call the 'getObject' method, but since it is not initialized yet, the proxy was not created, and this causes the following exception (Spring 2.5.5):  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'factory' defined in class path resource [fail-application-context.xml]: Cannot resolve reference to bean 'bean' while setting bean property 'target';

If a user attempts to fetch this bean by type from the container using `getBean(Foo.class)`, a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` will be thrown stating that there is an ambiguity because two beans of type `Foo` exist: `[foo, scopedTarget.foo]`.  As it is almost certainly the user's intent to retrieve the proxy and not the target, we should filter out the scoped target before evaluating whether there is an ambiguity.  A nice way of implementing this is to simply check whether each bean definition of the matching type is an autowire candidate.  If not, filter it from the list.  In this way, the list in the example above will be narrowed to exactly one bean, and that bean will be returned from the call to `getBean(Foo.class)`.   ---  **Attachments:** - [mylyn-context.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16475/mylyn-context.zip) (_1.56 kB_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/3f06a92b6b5fbd2f92444d10a25332f306dfb499","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-22T01:48:25Z","2012-06-19T03:44:02Z"

This is similar in concept to the way that TCF operates.

However, it would be nice, in simple cases, to be able to drop in `@Named` as a portable replacement for `@Value`.  For example:  `foo.properties`:  ``` prop.name=somevalue ```  `app-config.xml`:  ```  ```  ``` public class Foo {     public Foo(@Value(""${prop.name}"") String prop) { ... } } ```  The above works just fine, and `""somevalue""` gets injected as expected.  However, the following does not work:  ``` public class Foo {     public Foo(@Named(""${prop.name}"") String prop) { ... } } ```  Perhaps Spring's support for `@Named` can include searching through the properties contributed by property-placeholder (including system properties, etc, such that `@Named(""prop.name"")` 'just works'.  It would end up looking like the following:  ``` public class Foo {     public Foo(@Named(""prop.name"") String prop) { ... } } ```  This would provide a reasonable, portable alternative to `@Value`.  Again, users won't have the full power of `#{..`} SpEL expressions, but that's the tradeoff being made for portability in the first place.   --- No further details from [SPR-6251](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6251?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-10-20T02:05:20Z","2012-06-19T09:36:17Z"

There are two kinds of LOBs: ""ordinary"" LOBs and temporary LOBs. Temporary LOBs are constructed on the fly, e.g. while processing a select that appends to LOBs to each other (e.g. molformula || molformula) or functions that create LOBs (e.g. molfile(ctab) returns a temporary CLOB). Temporary CLOBs need to be stored somewhere until they are not needed any more, and they are stored in the TEMP tablespace.  From the Oracle documentation on ""Working With Temporary LOBs"": http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31224/oralob.htm#i1060097   ""When fetching data from a ReultSet with columns that are temporary LOBs, use getClob or getBlob instead of getString or getBytes. Also invoke freeTemporary to free the temporary LOBs.""  This practice is not implemented in OracleLobHandler. It has methods like  public String getClobAsString(ResultSet rs, int columnIndex) throws SQLException { logger.debug(""Returning Oracle CLOB as string""); Clob clob = rs.getClob(columnIndex); return (clob != null ? clob.getSubString(1, (int) clob.length()) : null); }  that should better be implemented that way:  public String getClobAsString(ResultSet rs, int columnIndex) throws SQLException { logger.debug(""Returning Oracle CLOB as string""); oracle.sql.CLOB clob = (oracle.sql.CLOB) rs.getClob(columnIndex); String returnString = (clob != null ? clob.getSubString(1, (int) clob.length()) : null); if( clob.isTemporary() ) { clob.freeTemporary(); } return returnString; }  I think that all getClob* / getBlob* methods are affected, although I just tested the change that I pasted above. It works for me, the TEMP tablespace does not get used much and I can fetch large amounts of records with temporary CLOBs - that was not possible before, I just got ""ORA-01652: unable to extend temp segment by 128 in tablespace TEMP"" after some time.  To reproduce, I think you need a sufficiently small TEMP tablespace, and a SELECT statement that returns large temporary CLOBs, e.g. by appending columns with ||  and returning the append result.  Without this fix, TEMP tablespace is freed only after Oracle session termination.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6, 3.0 RC1  **Issue Links:** - #10666 Memory Leak in Oracle LOB Reading??  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/5a158fb76f8d0cbf79b358de5a82bf3b60248a42","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2009-10-08T19:29:36Z","2019-01-11T14:43:13Z"

This means that the variables themselves, and any values returned from methods on them, will be wrapped by the `DefaultObjectWrapper`, rather than whichever one was configured.  Like `FreeMarkerView`, `FreeMarkerConfigurationFactory` should pass the object wrapper from the new `Configuration` to the `SimpleHash` constructor, so that it is used to wrap the variable values.  This is affecting me because I'm trying to use a custom wrapper that doesn't change the order of keys in a map returned from an object in the shared variables.   ---  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/026523d24b962d6cf27808390605c0f08fdccbdf","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-03T11:57:23Z","2012-06-19T03:43:59Z"

The method clearly does not support inheritance  We can currently work around the problem by doing this  `@RequestMapping`(value = ""/services/{serviceName}/scenes/video"", method = RequestMethod.POST) public void addScene(`@PathVariable`(""serviceName"") String serviceName, `@RequestBody` VideoTO receivedSceneTO, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) and `@RequestMapping`(value = ""/services/{serviceName}/scenes/audio"", method = RequestMethod.POST) public void addScene(`@PathVariable`(""serviceName"") String serviceName, `@RequestBody` AudioTO receivedSceneTO, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)  But it does seem less clean and results in much duplicated code.  Allowing inheritance would seem much more elegant.

Concurrent session control is activated and working. (please find enclosed my Spring Security configuration) have basically secured the web part of my app (pattern=""/**""), and the webservice (pattern=""/services/**""), but concurrent session control is present only for the web part, not for webservice. As stated before, everything works fine (acces is denied if user is not authenticated, concurrent session control works,...). My Spring Security configuration is loading through Spring application context with the following line in my applicationContext.xml: \  The problems appear once I reload my Spring application context calling the following code: WebApplicationContext context = WebApplicationContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(servletContext); ((AbstractApplicationContext) context).close(); ((AbstractApplicationContext) context).refresh();  My application context reloads fine (checked), but I cannot access my web application directly, I got access denied (by concurrent session control) everytime I try. The weird thing is that if I try to access a URL that has no concurrent session control (one of pattern=""/services/**"", e.g. my WSDL), then the next access to a secured URL (pattern=""/**"") is allowed, and I can use and navigate through my web app (and check that the reloaded context is working great). But if I try to connect directly to the web part (from the same browser instance, or a different browser instance after logout), my access is denied again. For example: _ application context is reloaded  _ trying to connect to http://localhost/myapp/ 00000027 LoggerListene W org.springframework.security.event.authentication.LoggerListener onApplicationEvent Authenticationevent AuthenticationFailureConcurrentLoginEvent: xxxxxxx; details: org.springframework.security.ui.WebAuthenticationDetails@957e: RemoteIpAddress: 127.0.0.1; SessionId: iatLVzWqI-R5VlynkIgjr9g; exception: Maximum sessions of 1 for this principal exceeded  _ trying to connect to http://localhost/myapp/ 00000027 LoggerListene W org.springframework.security.event.authentication.LoggerListener onApplicationEvent Authenticationevent AuthenticationFailureConcurrentLoginEvent: xxxxxxx; details: org.springframework.security.ui.WebAuthenticationDetails@957e: RemoteIpAddress: 127.0.0.1; SessionId: iatLVzWqI-R5VlynkIgjr9g; exception: Maximum sessions of 1 for this principal exceeded  _ trying to connect to http://localhost/myapp/ 00000027 LoggerListene W org.springframework.security.event.authentication.LoggerListener onApplicationEvent Authenticationevent AuthenticationFailureConcurrentLoginEvent: xxxxxxx; details: org.springframework.security.ui.WebAuthenticationDetails@957e: RemoteIpAddress: 127.0.0.1; SessionId: iatLVzWqI-R5VlynkIgjr9g; exception: Maximum sessions of 1 for this principal exceeded  _ trying to connect to http://localhost/myapp/services/WSmyapp?wsdl acces granted to WSDL (unsecured URL)  _ trying to connect to http://localhost/myapp/ 0000002f LoggerListene W org.springframework.security.event.authentication.LoggerListener onApplicationEvent Authenticationevent AuthenticationSuccessEvent: xxxxxxx; details: org.springframework.security.ui.WebAuthenticationDetails@0: RemoteIpAddress: 127.0.0.1; SessionId: q-UkiUE23CZ2_GE02w92tGu  I also tried to wait for the session timeout to occur (timeout was set to 2 minutes) after reloading my application context, but it did not work (I tried during the following 10 minutes, access is always denied by concurrent control session).  I also tried to logout (from my web app using a my logout button, the one that usually works to finish properly and works OK with concurrent session control if I do not reload my application context) after reloading my application context, access is always denied by concurrent control session.  I completely removed the concurrent control session and tested my app. In that case, once the application context is reloaded, I have no problem with Spring Security (i.e. I can access my web app and security is working). That is why I think there could be a problem with concurrent session control and application context reloading.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC1  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=78744  **Attachments:** - [spring-security.xml](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/15788/spring-security.xml) (_6.91 kB_)  6 votes, 8 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2009-10-08T23:44:18Z","2019-01-12T03:50:49Z"

The old way of doing things which was already deprecated was: DefinitionsFactoryUtil.reloadDefinitionsFactory(session.getServletContext());  That doesn't work any longer. The suggested way is to refresh the tiles dao being utilized, likely going through the definitionsFactory. Currently, however, there is no way of getting down there to call a refresh.  Suggested fix: Make it a configuration option to reload tiles if definition files have changed and set the scan time; much like ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource.

Today, as far as I know, the only way to re-arrange the default invocation sequence of model attributes is to create a custom MethodHandlerAdapter class.  * New interface:  ``` public interface HandlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback {     public void handlerMethodResolverCreated(org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.support.HandlerMethodResolver resolver); } ```  * New injectable property ""handlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback"" on org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter  * Change the method ""private HandlerMethodResolver getMethodResolver(Object handler)"" in the class AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter to invoke the callback method when a new methodMethodResolver is added to the methodResolverCache, if the handlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback property is set.  ``` ... this.methodResolverCache.put(handlerClass, resolver); if (handlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback != null) {    handlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback.handlerMethodResolverCreated(resolver); } ... ```  If the property ""handlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback"" is not set, AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.class will behave exactly as it does today.  Example of use-cases that can be solved by introducing this interface: 1. Re-arrange the invocation sequence of model-attributes to invoke the super.class ModelAttributes before this.class ModelAttributes. 2. Prevent overridden ModelAttributes from being invoked and populated into the model. 3. Make ModelAttributes depending on other modelAttributes to be invoked after the depending model-attributes have been resolved.  ``` public class CustomCallback implements HandlerMethodResolverCreatedCallback {     public void handlerMethodResolverCreated(HandlerMethodResolver resolver) {         Set methods = resolver.getModelAttributeMethods();         List list = new ArrayList(resolver.getModelAttributeMethods());          Collections.sort(list, new Comparator() {             public int compare(Method o1, Method o2) {                 Class c1 = o1.getDeclaringClass();                 Class c2 = o2.getDeclaringClass();                 if (c1.equals(c2)) return 0;                 if (c1.isAssignableFrom(c2)) return -1;                 if (c2.isAssignableFrom(c1)) return 1;                 return 0;             }         });          methods.clear();         methods.addAll(list);     } } ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC2","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-10-17T20:58:15Z","2018-12-28T10:43:36Z"

I have not exhaustively tested all derivatives of this problem, but it can be reproduced by enabling the aforementioned locale handling support classes and creating a form backing object that contains a field annotated with `@DateTimeFormat`(style=""LL""). The corresponding JSP can be a standard input element, as per . It is recommended to output the Locale.getDefault() and LocaleContextHolder.getLocale() from the form handling method responsible for GET operations. If these values differ (eg the system locale is ""en_AU"" whereas the browser locale is simply ""en"") the binding will fail.  This failure is interesting because during the GET use case the JSP will always render without a problem. However, clicking ""submit"" will result in an error:  Failed to convert property value of type java.lang.String[] to required type java.util.Date for property registered; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConversionFailedException: Unable to convert value [Ljava.lang.String;`@1c8f3cd` from type [[Ljava.lang.String;] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Unable to convert value December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Unable to convert value December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConversionFailedException: Unable to convert value December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConversionFailedException: Unable to convert value December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Unable to convert value December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is org.springframework.core.convert.ConversionFailedException: Unable to convert value December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Date]; reason = Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format: ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" is malformed at ""EST""  If the system locale is always ""en_AU"", the GET use case will show a different date depending on the browser's requested locale:  Locale ""en"" -> December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST Locale ""en_AU"" -> 3 December 2009 2:21:43 PM  If the browser locale is ""en_AU"" the date will be rendered as shown on the second line above and a POST will succeed. If the browser locale is simply ""en"" the POST will fail with the aforementioned error message.  If the browser locale is ""en"", and the user changes ""December 3, 2009 2:21:43 PM EST"" into ""3 December 2009 2:21:43 PM"" before submission, the POST will still fail.  It would seem this is a major bug given the GET rendered a representation of the date in a form that Spring MVC refuses to accept in a subsequent POST from the same browser, no matter what effort is made to format the date in a manner the server may wish to receive it in.  It is possible to work around this issue by disabling Spring's locale infrastructure and therefore all input will be considered as in system default locale format. It is also possible to work around this issue by using the embedded Eclipse browser, as it does not present browser language headers by default and therefore such users will default to the system default locale.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC3  **Attachments:** - [petclinic_2009-12-10_17_32_09.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/15995/petclinic_2009-12-10_17_32_09.zip) (_125.44 kB_)","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-03T13:35:57Z","2019-01-12T16:38:43Z"

This aspect ensures that direct usage of EntityManager will catch any resultant exceptions and convert them into Spring Framework's DataAccessException hierarchy. This makes it consistent with traditional `@Repository` usage or Spring's various data access abstraction templates.  It is desirable that the exception translation aspect be brought into Spring Aspects. It might be appropriate, though, to make it possible to require opt-in to use this feature perhaps by the invoking control flow having a particular annotation (ie it is probably undesirable that all usage of EntityManager receive this exception translation).  Please refer to the following FishEye location for the present exception translation aspect:  https://fisheye.springsource.org/browse/spring-roo/trunk/addon-jpa/src/main/resources/org/springframework/roo/addon/jpa/Jpa_Exception_Translator-template.txt#r305  Please refer to the following Jira issue for background to this feature:  http://jira.springframework.org/browse/ROO-182 http://jira.springframework.org/browse/ROO-255  Once this feature has been moved to Spring Framework I will modify Spring Roo accordingly.

Here is a typical scenario (using example).  1. A Web Form is simulating a User. User can have name and List of phoneNumbers. 2. phoneNumbers can be added dynamically using Javascript at client side. 3. Dynamic addition of phoneNumber into phoneNumbers is not a problem - Thanks to LazyList / AutoPopulatingList. 4. Dynamic Deletion is kind of an issue. Let's say the web form was rendered with phoneNumbers as {1,3,5,7,9}. Using Javascript the user removes {1,3} without submitting the form. Now when the form is submitted user.phoneNumbers should automatically have {5,7,9}.  There are number of articles I have read that explains this problem, but have not yet come across any elegant solution that handles dynalic deletions.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Attachments:** - [alpha.war](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16063/alpha.war) (_6.93 MB_) - [alpha-src.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16062/alpha-src.zip) (_7.02 MB_)  6 votes, 9 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-30T07:16:46Z","2019-01-12T03:50:40Z"

Or, alternatively, there could be some practicallz usable setting in the bean definition which would say if the same class loader has to be used like the bean definition class loader. Unfortunatelly I do not see any reasonable way how to set the proxy class loader programatically if running from the second classloader.   If the configurability of the classloader usage would be possible to implement, then if there is no clear technical reason which I do not see now, I would also prefer and find much more useful to set as the proxy class loader as default the same class loader, which has been used for the loading of the bean class itself rather than the default class loader of the spring framework.        My motivation was here to use Spring, used by the portal web application also for the instantiation of the beans in the portlet application, but then I cannot access the instantiated object through the interfaces, ""known"" to the portlet classloader, if the proxy resolves only such interfaces, which ""knows"" the portal classloader.    ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-11T22:22:44Z","2012-06-18T12:44:27Z"

The root of it was that the aspect is a singleton, and only copes with a single PlatformTransactionManager. In an OSGi environment, it's quite likely that there will be a single copy of the aspects bundle that's being shared by multiple applications, each of which would like to have its own PlatformTransactionManager.  Adrian and I spent a bit of time seeing if we could improve the situation such that the aspect could cope with multiple PlatformTransactionManagers. We believe we've been successful in doing so, but may well have overlooked some edge cases and subtleties. I'll attach a patch of the changes. It relies upon spring build 2.3.8 (so that we could configure the weaver appropriately). This means that, if Spring's not already on 2.3.8 or later, the svn:externals will need to be updated to:  spring-build -r694 https://src.springsource.org/svn/spring-build/tags/project-build-2.3.8  Hopefully the changes in the patch are reasonably self-explantory. The basic approach was to introduce PlatformTransactionManagerAware and to make any transactional beans implement the interface so that the PTM to be used (based on the application context's configuration) could be injected rather than pulling it from the singleton transaction aspect.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Attachments:** - [multiple-ptms.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/16198/multiple-ptms.patch) (_34.75 kB_)","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-14T23:08:26Z","2019-01-12T03:50:30Z"

As described there:  Although Keiths test now passes, more work is needed in ReflectivePropertyAccessor for a few reasons, but I wouldn't do that so close to a release:  - too much duplication in there and its messy - the typeDescriptorCache looks unnecessary - BeanTypeDescriptors are built separately for property reads and property writes. I did not want to switch to letting the PropertyDescriptor discover setters/getters (with limited time until release) and I didn't want to introduce the new cost of reflectively hunting for the opposing accessor when it may not be used (so hunting for the setter when a field is being read, just so the BeanTypeDescriptor would be fully populated). This means that metadata attached to the 'other accessor' may not make it through to the conversion. So if you annotate the setter, it wont (I dont think) affect the conversion service call for a property read. And if you annotate the getter, it wont affect the conversion service call for a property write. More thought and testing required here. Keith can probably knock up a test that shows this limitation - I'll need to discuss it with him how much of a likely real world issue it is.  This Jira is to cover the work to address that.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-12T02:38:31Z","2019-01-11T16:47:00Z"

Everytime I throw a business exception (which is meaningfull to my system) I get in my client side a RemoteAccessException (totally meaningless...). In order to know if it was some bug or if it was part of the business logic, I have to ""unpack"" this exception... I am sure you will agree this is not pretty nor is it right.  The expected behaviour of such proxy is that the exceptions declared in my service interface (normally business exceptions or of value to my business) are in fact caught directly in my client, not that they are wrapped around by some other meaningless exception.  To solve this problem we had to create a class which extended HessianProxyFactoryBean and use it to create the bean. It would be nice if the invoke method instead of wrapping the exceptions would just throw them as it is expected... I think.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=85159  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/cfbc5224e3c89aaed4243ac249618def82e6e3cc","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2010-02-23T22:48:43Z","2012-06-19T03:43:11Z"

We want to be able to return a XML or JSON response, based on what the client indicates in their Accept header.  However, in current web work, the view is based on resolving a view name. This doesn't have much meaning in the REST use case; we will return an object from a `@Controller`, and we want to be able to select a MarshallingView that supports an acceptable representation. Using ContentNegotiatingViewResolver, the `@Controller` returns a view name, which then has to be resolved, and will dictate what MarshallingView is selected. In other words, the `@Controller` has to decide on a xmlMarshallingView vs. a jsonMarshallingView, which defeats the purpose of the content negotiation.  I've adapted the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver to be able to take a list of views directly. When deciding on a MarshallingView to return, it goes through the list of registered views, and performs the negotiation on View.getContentType(...) vs. the media types in the HttpServletRequest. I'm implemented it as a RequestToViewNameTranslator, which returns a view bean name, and is used in conjunction with the BeanNameViewResolver to pull the right MarshallingView.  I will attach the code, and a configuration example. Using this with XStream annotations has worked pretty well for us.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC1  **Attachments:** - [ContentNegotiatingViewSelector.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/15791/ContentNegotiatingViewSelector.java) (_12.84 kB_) - [sample-servlet.xml](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/15792/sample-servlet.xml) (_2.95 kB_)  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2009-10-09T11:48:01Z","2012-11-02T05:43:46Z"

Alles in einem Satz erklärt ;)  Die Effekte sind kritisch da unterschiedliche User-Sessions vermischt werden. Wir vermuten dass es durch die wiederverwendeten Request-Objekte von jetty dazu kommt.

In unserem Workaround kopieren wir den Request nochmal in den ThreadLocal bevor das Runnable gestartet wird.  Ist jetzt die Frage ob es einen ""allg."" Weg gibt?

In my point of view, Spring is used a lot on server side but it is not very used on client side even though the framework has a lot of pros on a Desktop application. For instance, on client side, Spring is useful : - to use Spring proxy client like RMI, WS, EJB ... - to inject and mock your Business components - to test your GUI - to separate your Business components from your controller  During a long time, I tried to use elegantly IoC (Spring) on Desktop application without using an evil ServiceLocator singleton (containing a static applicationContext).  I tried to use for instance `@Configurable` and it is very elegant but there are poor performance and high memory usage problems (see http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-6252). Sot the solution is not usable for production.  I made an Swing GUI sample with the association of Swing Java Builder and Spring using `@Component` (or `@Named`) and `@Inject` (the sample is on http://code.google.com/p/javabuilders/issues/detail?id=83). The result is very elegant and the association of 2 frameworks is excellent. It is not the case generally with Swing and Spring because to inject a bean A into class B in Spring, the class B must be instantiated by Spring which is generally not possible (or easily possible) in Swing (the natural Swing Java Builder behavior resolves this point).  If you are interested, I can made a sample (with Spring and Swing Java Builder) like a petclinic client (with webservice proxy for instance) and do some documentation which will be accessible on Reference Documentation.

I'm writing Swing applications and I like using Spring in my client (not very common in a Swing application) because it is useful when you call some Remote Services (RMI, WS) by using the different Spring Proxy Clients or if you want to seperate your Business logic and GUI logic and so easy to test your gui.  The problem using Spring in Swing application is when you're making a Swing application, you need to inject in your Controller/View (JPanel for instance) some beans Spring. But your JPanel is not instanciated by Spring (and you can't it). To resolve this problem, I found 2 solutions - create a kind of ServiceLocator (where the applicationContext is instanciated). When you want to inject a bean Spring, you must ServiceLocator.getInstance().getYourSpringBean(). It is very old-fashioned and has all problems related to static singleton (not easy too test, problem in Netbeans RCP like Tomcat for static stuffs ...). - use `@Configurable` on your panel (not instanciated by Spring) to inject with `@Autowired` in some spring bean. It very clean and elegant on my point of view.  I made a small application with `@Configurable` and it works but it reveals some performance and memory usage problems. When you use a GUI with a ServiceLocator, the startup of this application is something like 2 s (1s for Swing and 2s for spring context in lazy mode) and the memory usage is 10 mo. When you use the same GUI with `@Configurable` (with the spring agent) the startup of the application is something like 10 s and the memory usage is 50-60 mo.  I attached a very small application example to show the problem. With this sample, when you use a GUI with a ServiceLocator, the startup of this application is something like 900 ms (250 ms for Swing and 650 ms for spring context in lazy mode) and the memory usage is 1.2 mo. When you use the same GUI with `@Configurable` (with the spring agent) the startup of the application is something like 3.6 s (1350 ms for Swing and 2280 ms for spring context in lazy mode) and the memory usage is 8 mo.  So the performance and memory usage is degraded by 5.  I tested with Spring 2.5.6 and with 3.0RC1 and the behaviour is the same.  Can you explain this behaviour? Is it normal? Maybe I have misconfigured my applicationContext. Can I specify the package where `@Configurable` classes are located to improve performance?  Honnestly, with these problems, `@Configurable` is just unuseable for production GUI application but only for unit tests.

Since i18n is a very key part of our architecture we need to modify messages at runtime without class reloading but since ResourceBundleMessageSource always caches the result we are unable to update a message.  So we have created a subclass that allows us to overcome this problem but still uses a cache for performance. The trick is to cache the MessageFormat result instead of the key, this way, even if something less is cached, the possibility to update the value for a key remains open (while still caching the corresponding MessageFormat).

Even worse - developers declaring (D3) assuming they would override the implicit one (D1) will end up with two instances of DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping (D2 and D3) resulting in duplicate registration of annotated controllers (component scan) and custom parameterization which will be without any effect as D2 seems to win over D3.

(A particular case is to implement format representation handling override via reading the _format_ query parameter instead of relying on the _Accept_ header) A proposed improvement would be to move the creation of a messages into an overwritable method which would create an appropriate implementation.

In this case, the JDBC driver (Postgresql) bombs. I suggest to call the setter only when the configured transaction isolation is different than the connection one. Example:  ``` ... // Apply specific isolation level, if any.

I define my actions as spring beans and would like to use `@Component` annotation and no XML configuration.  My problem is that an action path must correspond to the same Spring bean id.  And I can have the same spring bean used for multiple actions.  i.e /charge/view and /charge/save should map to the same bean.  I cannot do it with `@Component` annotation alone, and would need a `@Alias` or `@Role` annotation.  For instance something like :  ``` @Component(""/charge/view"") @Roles({`@Role`(""/charge/remove""),     @Role(""/charge/edit""),     @Role(""/charge/save"")}) public class EditChargeClienteleAction extends MappingDispatchAction { ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=83133  16 votes, 12 watchers","open","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2010-01-20T21:40:46Z","2022-05-12T08:02:52Z"

We noticed that there's a break when we moved to 3.0.0.RC3.  **Details:** In the getTransaction(...) method, when doBegin(...) is called, the TransactionStatus is now instantiated using a private method instantiateTransactionStatus(). This breaks our transactionManager that extends newTransactionStatus(). This is infact the case for all the instances where doBegin() is called throughout the code. _Note: The split between creation of the TransactionStatus and preparingSynchronization whereever doBegin() is being called is correct in that the TransactionStatus needs to be created before a call to doBegin() - this was an OOM issue that Juergen had fixed in 3.0.rc1_  **Proposed Solution:** newTransactionStatus(...) should keep doing what it did earlier i.e. simply be responsible for creating the new TransactionStatus. The prepareSynchronization(...) method should be called outside of it.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0 RC3  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/93abbd0ef76a4e7c35ed5fd4a6307ef1da34b1d5","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2009-12-04T06:19:34Z","2012-06-19T03:44:07Z"

The results from both of those methods is being rendered by the MappingJacksonJsonView.  My problem is that the session model attribute is by default being rendered along with the method's returned model attributes and causing a problem if another call to add an item to that collection is in progress while Jackson is marshalling.  This is throwing a ConcurrentModificationException.  I can't set renderedAttributes for the entire view instance, and there are other methods in my controller that will need to render that collection.  I do not have any way of excluding a model attribute from the JSON rendering for those one or two methods in the controller.  Could there be an annotation for the method to exclude model attributes from being rendered or specifically filter to a list of attributes?   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.1, 3.0.2, 3.0.3","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2010-04-28T01:25:04Z","2019-01-12T16:38:00Z"

The idea is to reset objects that are updated. While this can be achieved through proxying and a small amount of coding support with target sources, this could be easier implemented without the need for proxying if this container ""capability"" was available.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=298106#post298106","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2010-05-04T00:31:00Z","2018-12-28T10:54:35Z"
