"","9578","Allow locations value in PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer be resolved [SPR-4902]","**[Zemian Deng](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=thebugslayer)** opened **[SPR-4902](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4902?redirect=false)** and commented  When configuring PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer bean, the ""locations"" value can use property resolvable variable, but only if it defined in System properties ONLY. If not defined, it errors out. It would be very useful to have it also lookup an defined Map in another bean within the context that provide default values.  I notice that we can do this on other bean definitions after a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer has been setup, but the ""locations"" properties of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer bean itself is not configurable, which is a shame.  Can we add this improvement?  Thanks.

Currently, ClassPathXmlApplicationContext does not provide a facility to disable XSD validation in a straight forward manner. Even though it is possible to do so by subclassing ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, it would be better to allow users to enable / disable XSD validation through the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext itself.  As of Spring 2.5, XSD validation is not required to the framework to function properly. [Ref: SPR-3894]  This can be done with a minor code change in ClassPathXmlApplicationContext as follows:  public class ClassPathXmlApplicationContext extends AbstractXmlApplicationContext {      private Resource[] configResources;     private boolean validation = true;		//  validation is enabled by default          protected void initBeanDefinitionReader(XmlBeanDefinitionReader beanDefinitionReader) {     	     	// If XSD validation is disabled     	if (! validation) {     		beanDefinitionReader.setValidationMode(XmlBeanDefinitionReader.VALIDATION_NONE);     		beanDefinitionReader.setNamespaceAware(true);     	}     	     }          // Provide overloaded constructors to enable / disable validation     public ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(String configLocation, boolean validation) throws BeansException {     	this(new String[] {configLocation}, true, null);     	this.validation = validation;     }          // < REST OF CODE OMMITED>   }   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5  2 votes, 4 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-16T15:37:42Z","2019-05-06T22:00:42Z"

ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping and BeanNameHandlerMapping are a little agile, but they can only map the url to the class level, can not support the method level.  In Spring MVC 2.5, DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping is a new way for URL Mapping. Developers can use `@RequestMapping` to map a url to a class level or a method level. But the url is hard coded. And the url mapping value even has the url request suffix.  http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4125 The opinion in this report is valuable. Maybe there is a better solution.

To do that, I simply define an interface with a method for each message, the arguments of those methods representing the parameters of the message. The invocation handler used to create this proxy simply delegates the message resolving part to a MessageSource.  This is very useful when you have services which really need to generate messages at their level (for example: email sending, rcp).  So I thought I could share it if other people would happen to have a similar need. Of course, it needs to be polished by some spring expert to match spring overall quality ;-)  Xavier   ---  **Attachments:** - [MessagesFactoryBean.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13921/MessagesFactoryBean.java) (_3.38 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-04-11T06:35:57Z","2012-06-19T09:36:17Z"

I realize that using a ref of box1.item1 would look for a property rather than a bean id named item1. I'd like to propose a feature request where either you could specify something like ref=""box1>item1"" (i.e. new operator) or nested-ref=""box1.item1"" (i.e. new attribute) for the property element, and it would get the bean with id item1 defined within the bean with id box1.  My reasoning for this request is that when a bean needs to be referenced by other beans but that bean is contained within a parent bean (e.g. an 'item' bean contained by a 'box' bean), referring to that bean should be possible within the context of its containing bean. Currently, the only option is to change every nested bean into a top-level bean with an id:  Code: \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  There are two problems with the above approach, the first being a more verbose configuration, which is only a minor issue. The second, bigger, problem is that as your configuration grows larger, you'll see a large number of top-level beans (beans of class MyItem, in this example) polluting the same namespace unnecessarily. To make this situation more manageable and maintainable, you might then prefix every bean with the name of its containing bean:  Code: \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  The problem with the above is not only that the bean ids are redundant (box1.item1 is contained within box1), but also that when your configuration grows larger, mistakes like box101 containing ref box201.item1 instead of box101.item1 become easier to make.  A problem with my proposed feature in the original code sample is that because the nested beans' ids are of XML schema type ID, they must be unique throughout the configuration. Then item1 in box1 and item1 in box2 would conflict. In order to correct this, every nested bean's id could be defined by an attribute other than 'id', such as 'nested-id', which wouldn't have to be unique throughout the configuration:  Code: \ \  \ \ \  \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ The only requirement for uniqueness with nested-id attributes would be that all children of a common parent (i.e. sibling beans) do not have the same nested-id. However, a nested bean can have the same nested-id as its parent or child, and of a child of a different parent. Furthermore, top-level beans would not be permitted to have a nested-id.   --- No further details from [SPR-4292](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4292?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-02T06:38:30Z","2012-06-19T09:36:12Z"

"","9552","[Performance] CachedIntrospectionResults has wrong approach to caching. [SPR-4876]","**[Tomasz Wysocki](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=tawek)** opened **[SPR-4876](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4876?redirect=false)** and commented  Current approach in CachedIntrospectionResults is to cache ""weakly"" classes that are supposed to be ""not cache-safe"". This unfortunately causes that ""weakly"" cached introspection results can expire on gc. Rebuilding cached introspection results is costly in environments where there are lots of classes on a classpath. What is more rebuilding cause multi-threaded applications to synchronize on rebuilding. That cause significant drops in performance for periods of rebuilding which is not acceptable. This had been observed with JMeter running against some portal installation and diagnosed with YJP 7.5 profiler.  Maybe it is not common approach to put spring jars on a server classpath, but it will become more and more common with environments (OSGi for instance) where spring is a part of a platform. So putting spring jar on a server classpath cause all application classes not to be cache-safe. Workaround that forces applications to register it classloaders as cache-safe explicitly does seem a wrong solution for a problem to me.  I propose a different approach where unloading of cached introspection results is triggered by unloading a classloader. It has two of benefits compared to existing solution. 1. Application do not need to register and unregister their classloaders. 2. Introspection results are persisted as long as application is loaded and do not expire on GC. 3. Cached introspection results expire when application is unloaded.  Modified CachedIntrospectionResults  class from 2.0 version renamed to CachedIntrospectionResults2 follows as proposed solution. Note that I've decided to use 2.0 version because I see improvements done in later version as a step in a wrong direction. As you can see implementation is straight-forward and does not require any registration/unregistration of classloaders, and isCacheSafe method had been removed entirely (all classes are regarded as cache safe).  ```java /*  * Copyright 2002-2006 the original author or authors.  *  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License"");  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.  * You may obtain a copy of the License at  *  *      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0  *  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software  * distributed under the License is distributed on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and  * limitations under the License.  */  package org.springframework.beans;  import java.beans.BeanInfo; import java.beans.IntrospectionException; import java.beans.Introspector; import java.beans.PropertyDescriptor; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.WeakHashMap;  import org.apache.commons.logging.Log; import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;  /**  * Class to cache PropertyDescriptor information for a Java class.  * Package-visible; not for use by application code.  *  * Necessary as Introspector.getBeanInfo() in JDK 1.3 will return a  * new deep copy of the BeanInfo every time we ask for it.

However when I start a transaction that does not do anything with the database (not very useful in practice), it still acquires a connection from the pool (c3p0 logs this in debug mode).  What is the reason for acquiring a db connection before it's actually used? Like this, unnecessarily many db connections are used.

For historical reasons, the connections are produced by a static method on a factory class. So each connection bean is declared using the factory-method syntax. For example:                       The getDefDispatchConn method is declared to return a ""Connection"".  So my first problem is that the MBeanExporter.autodetect(AutodetectCallback) method only looks for annotations on the beanFactory.getType() type (which is going to be the interface). This is alright (even though in the !laxyInit case, it could use the actual instance for the include check), so I put my `@ManagedResource` and `@ManagedAttribute` annotations on the interface.  But then, things still weren't working. I found that AnnotationJmxAttributeSource.getManagedResource(Class) uses the Class.getAnnotation method(Class) method (and at this point we're using the Class of the actual instance, SpecificConnection). This causes a problem because it will not find the annotation on the interface (or on the base class, for that matter). So, I overrode this method to use AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation. This got me closer. But now, none of the attributes were being found. Because it doesn't seem like findAnnotation(Method,Class) can find annotations on interfaces, I had to move the `@ManagedAttribute` annotations to the ABC.  So in summary, I had to place a `@ManagedResource` on the interface to get the bean included in the first place, then this annotation must also be on each concrete class OR getManagedResource muse be overridden, and finally the attributes may not be annotated at the interface level.  Obviously taking the FactoryBean out of the picture would simplify things, but it seems like something here could be improved.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  **Issue Links:** - #8316 Allow `@ManagedXYZ` on interfaces  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/8f6a42bf646442192dcae01a9334f246508c7c99  3 votes, 3 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-25T06:26:24Z","2019-01-13T08:03:09Z"

It is my opinion that one of the following would be more useful:  1. Determine the attrName from the name of the annotated method. If the method was called getImportantData, the attrName could be set to ""importantData"". If the method name didn't start with a get/is, the attrName could simple be equal to the method name.  2. Instead of simply delegating to the ModelMap class, uses its conventions but apply them to the return type of the method. I'm not a huge fan of the getVariableName idea, but it would be more useful if it took into account the declared return type. If I have a method called ""List\ getImportantData()"", the attrName could be ""someBaseClassList"" (which is better than arbitrarily picking the class of one item in the list).  I like #1, this is what I expected to happen before I tried it. It also seems to follow how `@RequestMapping` works when no value is declared.

This bug is very difficult to reproduce but has a large impact. The fix is however simple, please handle this with high priority.  This issue occures when the concurrentConsumers=1 and maxConcurrentConsumers > 1. It is caused by a race condition in the AsyncMessageListenerInvoker.run method.  Consider the following logging and code: DEBUG : org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer > Received message of type [class progress.message.jimpl.TextMessage] from consumer [progress.message.jimpl.QueueReceiver@18ad9a0] of session [] 08/06/18 12:36:15.539, jms://x4.cti.AgentService?id=AgentService-525 DEBUG : org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer > Raised scheduled invoker count: 2 08/06/18 12:36:15.539, jms://x4.cti.AgentService?id=AgentService-525 DEBUG : org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer > Lowered scheduled invoker count: 1 08/06/18 12:36:18.554, jms://x4.cti.AgentService?id=AgentService-526 DEBUG : org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer > Lowered scheduled invoker count: 0 08/06/18 12:36:18.554, jms://x4.cti.AgentService?id=AgentService-527  You can see that two threads lower the invoker count at the same time, cause the scheduled count to be 0 and stopping the container.

Because shouldRescheduleInvoker() is synchronized(activeInvokerMonitor) thread A will do the check and stop at line y. Then thread B will do the same check with the same result (becaus thread A did not yet do the remove) and also stop at line Y. Both threads will proceed by removing themself from the scheduled invokers ending up with an emty scheduledInvokers list causing the end of both trheads, instead of the minimum of 1. No new thread is scheduled and the listenercontainer just stops working at all.  The check shouldRescheduleInvoker() and the update of scheduledInvokers.remove() should be in the same syncronized block: AsyncMessageListenerInvoker.run() { ...      synchronized (activeInvokerMonitor) {     	if (!shouldRescheduleInvoker(this.idleTaskExecutionCount) || !rescheduleTaskIfNecessary(this)) {     		     		scheduledInvokers.remove(this);     		if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {     			logger.debug(""Lowered scheduled invoker count: "" + scheduledInvokers.size());     		}     		activeInvokerMonitor.notifyAll();     	     		clearResources();     	}     	else if (isRunning()) {     		int nonPausedConsumers = getScheduledConsumerCount() - getPausedTaskCount();     		if (nonPausedConsumers < 1) {     			logger.error(""All scheduled consumers have been paused, probably due to tasks having been rejected.

It runs fine in a signed jar with Spring 2.0.8 but since the upgrade now takes 5 or more minutes to start as opposed to 10-15 seconds under Spring 2.0.8.  What's interesting is that it's equally fast with Spring 2.5.3 as long as the jar is unsigned. However, as soon as you sign the jar and then run the application (via java -cp ourfile.jar mainclass) it takes forever to start. Downgrading back to Spring 2.0.8 also solves the issue. Getting stack dumps show that it seems like as of Spring 2.5.x (we tried 2.5.1-2.5.3) during startup on a signed jar is now spending a tremendous amount of time doing jar verification triggered from org.springframework.core.io.UrlResource.

When it creates a proxy at line 688 it expects to get a cglib proxy. But when the target bean is a FactoryBean that states that it returns an interface then the returned prozy is actually a JDK-proxy. This causes an exception from doRegister() on line 694. I suggest that a check is added that detects if the TargetSource is aimed at an interface and skips the call to doRegister and outputs a warning that the bean wont be exported.  The FactoryBean that triggered this for me was WebFlow's FlowRegistryFactoryBean.   ---  **Attachments:** - [SPR4943JmxUtilsTest.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14331/SPR4943JmxUtilsTest.java) (_927 bytes_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-06-23T02:38:42Z","2019-01-11T18:27:42Z"

In the seldom case when there was an error in the Controller, and the errorView should have been hit, we whitnessed on OutOfMemoryError effectively bringing down the whole VM.  What seems to cause this is the following: In DispatcherServlet.java, around line 880(since Spring-2.5-final only), there is: // Do we need view name translation? if (mv != null && !mv.hasView()) { mv.setViewName(getDefaultViewName(request)); } ... were the default viewNameTranslator, a DefaultRequestToViewNameTranslator(unset in our config) chooses the viewName to consist of the same path that was already in the request URL, which in turn leads to the same handler/controller being hit. Thus, we have a loop now, in that the same controller gets hit constantly with an ever growing URL(the viewName is appended to the URL) until an OutOfMemoryException occurs.  In the logs, it looks sth. like this: mvc.multiaction.AbstractUrlMethodNameResolver: Returning handler method name 'activateUser' for lookup path: /2139252/0/de/web/endUser/action/activateUser.html std.web.EndUserController: cannot register user (bad key or state!=EMAILCONFIRM) [error in controller, now null errorView in ModelAndView ] 2008-01-05 05:03:43,640 [DEBUG] [http-80-1] [] [2139252] [] tools.servlet.ClientInternalResourceViewResolver: in resolveViewName('2139252/0/de/web/endUser/action/activateUser',..)

Is the above mentioned code in DispatcherServlet really needed at this place, even if it bears the risk of an OOME if a null errorView name is hit?    ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-11T01:49:01Z","2012-06-19T03:47:09Z"

FileSystemResource seems to differ in handling File and String path based constructors. Observe the following tiny test program:  public class FileSystemResourceTestCase { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { FileSystemResource fr1 = new FileSystemResource(""c:/dir1/""); Resource fr2 = fr1.createRelative(""dir2/foot.txt""); System.out.println(""A-fr1: "" + fr1 + "", fr2: "" + fr2);      	fr1 = new FileSystemResource(new File(""c:/dir1/""));     	fr2 = fr1.createRelative(""dir2/foot.txt"");     	System.out.println(""B-fr1: "" + fr1 + "", fr2: "" + fr2);     }  }  It will print:  A-fr1: file [c:\dir1], fr2: file [c:\dir1\dir2\foot.txt] B-fr1: file [c:\dir1], fr2: file [c:\dir2\foot.txt]  Which is very surprising to me although I can guess at the technical details leading to this problem. Nonetheless to me it seems that File-parameters of directory type should be handled like String parameters with a trailing slash (see your insightfuil comments for the #9044 report).  ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-22T02:10:35Z","2019-01-11T16:36:35Z"

It obviously supports resolution as a File, and as a URL."".  java.io.File is able to work with directories, but when trying to do this with FileSystemResource relative resources do not work.  Example:  Directory Structure: c:/dir1 c:/dir1/dir2 File Structure c:/dir1/dir2/foo.txt  Test: FileSystemResource base = new FileSystemResource(new File(""c:/dir1"")); FileSystemResource derived = base.createRelative(""dir2/foo.txt""); System.out.println(derived.exists()); // yields false  When examining the actual path in ""derived"" you will see that it refers to ""c:/dir2/foo.txt"". The problem lies in the following code in the FileSystemResource implementation:      String pathToUse = StringUtils.applyRelativePath(this.path, relativePath);  and in turn in the StringUtils implementation:      public static String applyRelativePath(String path, String relativePath) {     	int separatorIndex = path.lastIndexOf(FOLDER_SEPARATOR);     	if (separatorIndex != -1) {     		String newPath = path.substring(0, separatorIndex);     		if (!relativePath.startsWith(FOLDER_SEPARATOR)) {     			newPath += FOLDER_SEPARATOR;     		}     		return newPath + relativePath;     	}     	else {     		return relativePath;     	}     }  because both in combination do not take into account directories.

This allows for custom sql modification prior to being passed off to the internal NamedParameterUtils class which offers no callbacks.  SimpleJdbcTemplate delegates to NamedParameterJdbcOperations (default being NamedParameterJdbcTemplate) for all methods using named parameters except for the batchUpdate methods.  These methods use the private method doExecuteBatchUpdateWithNamedParameters which directly invokes NamedParameterUtils.  Thus, in order to handle custom sql modification for batchUpdates, SimpleJdbcTemplate must be overridden to not only use a custom subclass for the NamedParameterJdbcOperations but to invoke the custom logic in the applicable batchUpdate methods.  It would be nice to add batchUpdate to NamedParameterJdbcTemplate (as requested in #8007) and then delegate to this from SimpleJdbcTemplate. In this way, all sql parsing would be routed through an overridable getParsedSql.  ---  **Affects:** 2.0.8, 2.5 final, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 2.5.5  **Issue Links:** - #8007 Add a batchUpdate method to namedParameterJdbcTemplate","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-09-17T05:55:46Z","2019-01-11T15:40:25Z"

Saucier](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=saucier)** opened **[SPR-4766](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4766?redirect=false)** and commented  I've looked through the Spring source code, and there are still several inconsistencies regarding PropertyEditor handling.  The main areas in which PropertyEditor lookup seems to be occuring is in BeanUtils (findEditorByConvention), PropertyEditorRegistrySupport (findCustomEditor, getCustomEditor), AbstractBindingResult (findEditor), AbstractPropertyBindingResult (getCustomEditor) and TypeConverterDelegate (getDefaultEditor). There are a few others (findEditor in BindException and BindStatus and findCustomEditor in DataBinder) but these seem to be straightforward delegate methods.  While it would be ideal if we could get some consistency between these methods (is if findEditor, findCustomEditor or findDefaultEditor? Is it valueType, requiredType or targetType? Is it property value first then the target type, or the other way around?) there are some logical changes that I think should be made:  1. getCustomEditor of AbstractPropertyBindingResult is effectively the same as the findEditor method of AbstractBindingResult (which is the superclass of AbstractPropertyBindingResult!) when called with a null second argument, excepting the call to BeanUtils.findEditorByConvention which was just added. I believe this method should be removed.  2. The call to BeanUtils.findEditorByConvention could be moved to the findEditor method of AbstractBindingResult, but I'd argue this logic more appropriately belongs in PropertyEditorRegistrySupport. Currently, PropertyEditorRegistrySupport can only find PropertyEditors registered with registerCustomEditor, but not by the JavaBeans PropertyEditor class name convention.  3. AbstractBindingResult claims that the findEditor method returns null, which is not supported by the implementation. The javadoc comment should be fixed.  4. PropertyEditorRegistrySupport and TypeConverterDelegate have fundamentally different algorithms for finding PropertyEditors. I am not sure if this is by design. The differences appear to be:  a. PropertyEditorRegistrySupport will attempt to find PropertyEditors for supertypes or interfaces. b. TypeConverterDelegate uses BeanUtils.findEditorByConvention to locate PropertyEditors (see item 2, above). c. TypeConverterDelegate uses PropertyEditorManager.findEditor to locate PropertyEditors. d. TypeConverterDelegate can locate a PropertyEditor from a PropertyDesciptor.  At a minimum, it seems reasonable to me to add support for b and d to PropertyEditorRegistrySupport.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  **Attachments:** - [SPR-4766.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14009/SPR-4766.patch) (_3.86 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-04-30T16:13:58Z","2015-09-22T17:34:36Z"

I believe this same behavior should apply to Spring path expressions. Currently the ""."" operator is used for bean properties and the [] operator is used for collections. It seems that it would be useful to have a consistent interpretation with JSP for cases where Spring path expressions are being used in JSP (for example in Spring's form tag library).  For example, given a list ""list"", I can use ""list[0]"" in a Spring path expression but not ""list.0"".

However, if I request /test/other it still matches the index() method (and resolves the view to /WEB-INF/other.jsp). Similarly, if I request /test/, the index() method is called and my view is resolved to /WEB-INF/.jsp. This is because in resolveHandlerMethod of AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter$ServletHandlerMethodResolver, if no paths are specified on the `@RequestMapping` annotation, a parameter match is sufficient.

Saucier](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=saucier)** opened **[SPR-4648](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4648?redirect=false)** and commented  I'm having trouble tracking down what exactly is the solution to my problem, so please be gentle if my description here seems a bit obtuse...  I'm developing a controller using the `@Controller` annotation and not extending any of Spring's Controller base classes.  I have a method annotated with the ModelAttribute annotation (not on a parameter, on the method) returning my default ""form backing object"" e.g.  `@ModelAttribute` public Object getDefaultObject() { return this.beanFactory.getBean(""defaultObject""); }  and I've declared ""defaultObject"" in my spring configuration as having a ""prototype"" scope. Of course, the actual object I'm returning is not an java.lang.Object, it is a JavaBean with properties that are other JavaBeans (that is, an object graph) but this is exemplary.  so far, so good...  The problem is, unless I declare a `@ModelAttribute` parameter on my handler method (that is, a method annotated with `@RequestMapping`), the property editors I've registered in my spring configuration (through the webBindingInitializer parameter of the AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter class) do not get applied to the properties of my ""form backing object"". This manifests itself as the properties of my form backing object showing up in my form fields as Strings produced through the bean property's toString() method, and not through the corresponding PropertyEditor implementation I've registered through the webBindingInitializer.  As mentioned above, I can work around this issue by adding an explicit `@ModelAttribute` parameter to my handler method, but I'm not actually using the object in my handler method which would make it appear as if the parameter is erroneous. I'd prefer if the property editors were registered by default for any objects returned by methods annotated with `@ModelAttribute` instead.  Based on my uneducated perusal of the spring source code, it seems that in the getModelAndView method of the AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter class, the last if case (!BeanUtils.isSimpleProperty(returnValue.getClass())) ought to create some sort of DataBinder, perhaps using something like: createBinder((HttpServletRequest) webRequest.getNativeRequest(), returnValue, attrName); before the line: return mav.addObject(attrName, returnValue); (in spring 2.5.2, this is line 633).

It's a maven2 based project. But I left my IDEA project files created from the pom within that zip-file.  The tests testng_online.xml are in the module apptmpl (actually the only module in that zip) and the execution directory must be set to that module's directory. The test requires a postgres db and takes the master db configured within apptmpl/src/test/resources/applicationContextTest.xml and will create a fresh database to be used for each test class using the sql scripts within this project - that's why the execution path must be apptmpl/ so the scripts will be found correctly.  — I posted this first to http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=49301&referrerid=34190  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1  **Attachments:** - [startest.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13599/startest.zip) (_82.67 kB_)","closed","in: data,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-03T18:32:40Z","2019-01-13T21:53:35Z"

So in the form after submitting the POST request it would display ""old title"".  Removing the BindingResult attributes  modelMap.remove(""org.springframework.validation.BindingResult.book"");  will solve the problem (i.e. new title is displayed). So it seems the BindingResult gets mixed up with the model attribute. However, the user would be expected to know about the internals of ModelMap which should not be necessary..  We could expose an extended ModelMap class that automatically removes BindingResult attributes if the corresponding target attribute is overridden.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-09-23T10:03:16Z","2012-06-19T03:46:59Z"

HibernateTemplate should detect a HibernateTransactionManager-driven transaction where the transactional Session is obtained through a custom SessionFactory proxy.  In the JTA case, there are no guarantees that openSession() will be called through the proxy in the first place since Hibernate's own JTA support uses internal calls on the SessionFactory there.  However, Hibernate's own CurrentSessionContext implementations will keep using the native SessionFactory object directly. Native sessionFactory.getCurrentSession() calls will always bypass the custom SessionFactory proxy's openSession() method. The custom proxy needs to intercept and handle getCurrentSession() calls accordingly as well.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5  **Issue Links:** - #8051 HibernateTemplate doesn't work with Transactions externally managed behind hibernates getCurrentSession()","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-23T13:57:10Z","2019-01-11T14:34:03Z"

In this case, the underlying WS code throws an SQLException which is caught by the ReflectionUtils invoker, wrapped in an InvocationTargetException. This MESSAGE from this exception is then re-thrown as an IllegalStateException within the ReflectionUtils method. Therefore, the WebSphereDataSourceAdapter has no way of obtaining the 'real' (SQLException) cause for the error and throws as a result an IllegalStateException instead of an SQLException (as declared by the method).  The impact of this problem is not devastating in my opinion, but does result in SQL errors that are NOT wrapped by their corresponding Spring counterparts. This, in turn leads our SpringMVC layer to print a 'general error' JSP page instead of the more appropriate 'data error' page we have configured.  What I see as the best solution with the least impact on other code is as follows: - Do _not_ use ReflectionUtils.invokeMethod call, but use its code directly in the WebSphereDataSourceAdapter. - In case of an InvocationTargetException, check if the target exception happens to be an SQLException, and throw it if it is. Otherwise, simply imitate original ReflectionUtils behaviour.

Also when using PROPAGATION_MANDATORY we do not get an exception. In both cases we have no running transaction. When we switch to the JtaTransactionManager the problem goes away.  It appears that the check for a running transaction is insufficiant, since there is no differentiation between a global transaction context and local transaction containment (LTC). Since WebSphere always has local transaction containment as a default transaction context (See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0506_johnsen/0506_johnsen.html) the WebSphereUowTransactionManager always assumes there is a running transaction.  When an extra check is added in WebSphereUowTransactionManager in the method execute that the UOWType is not a UOW_TYPE_LOCAL_TRANSACTION the problem is solved :  public Object execute(TransactionDefinition definition, TransactionCallback callback) throws TransactionException { if (definition == null) { // Use defaults if no transaction definition given. definition = new DefaultTransactionDefinition(); }      if (definition.getTimeout() < TransactionDefinition.TIMEOUT_DEFAULT) {          throw new InvalidTimeoutException(""Invalid transaction timeout"", definition.getTimeout());     }     int pb = definition.getPropagationBehavior();     boolean existingTx = (this.uowManager.getUOWStatus() != UOWSynchronizationRegistry.UOW_STATUS_NONE           && this.uowManager.getUOWType() != UOWSynchronizationRegistry.UOW_TYPE_LOCAL_TRANSACTION);     int uowType = UOWSynchronizationRegistry.UOW_TYPE_GLOBAL_TRANSACTION;     boolean joinTx = false;     boolean newSynch = false;    ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-18T01:05:20Z","2012-06-19T03:47:07Z"

We rendered our report via an AbstractController and set the cacheSeconds property to zero (we know that for excel/pdf due to a bug in IE6 we need to set the cacheSeconds to -1, but say for now we are only interested about the HTML report without caching). But the problem is when the user logged out from our application and clicked the back button s/he can see the report from cache, but there should be no cache. (FYI: In other pages of our application we use the cacheSeconds property to prevent caching and it worked fine). Then we investigate bit further by using an application WebScarab to intercept the response and watched that in the report response only ""Pragma"" header is set, where as cacheSeconds instructs to set three headers in default settings - ""Pragma"", ""Cache-Control"" and ""Expires"".  We have manually setup those three headers in the view (JasperReportsMultiFormatView) in controller and it works fine. So where is the problem? why setting cacheSeconds is not sufficient to set those headers? Does Jasper overwrite/reset headers which are already set by spring or is it a spring-jasper integration code problem?  Detailed analysis:  ---  I debugged the spring code to see where the response cache headers got lost after set via the WebContentGenerator. In WebContentGenerator the following method adds the cache prevention headers to response:  Code:  protected final void preventCaching(HttpServletResponse response) { response.setHeader(HEADER_PRAGMA, ""No-cache""); if (this.useExpiresHeader) { // HTTP 1.0 header response.setDateHeader(HEADER_EXPIRES, 1L); } if (this.useCacheControlHeader) { // HTTP 1.1 header: ""no-cache"" is the standard value, // ""no-store"" is necessary to prevent caching on FireFox. response.setHeader(HEADER_CACHE_CONTROL, ""no-cache""); response.addHeader(HEADER_CACHE_CONTROL, ""no-store""); } }  But in the AbstractJasperReportsView the response is reset and the headers are populated again in the following way in renderMergedOutputModel method:  Code:      protected void renderMergedOutputModel(Map model, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)     		throws Exception {          	if (this.subReports != null) {     		// Expose sub-reports as model attributes.     		model.putAll(this.subReports);          		// Transform any collections etc into JRDataSources for sub reports.     		if (this.subReportDataKeys != null) {     			for (int i = 0; i < this.subReportDataKeys.length; i++) {     				String key = this.subReportDataKeys[i];     				model.put(key, convertReportData(model.get(key)));     			}     		}     	}          	// Expose Spring-managed Locale and MessageSource.     	exposeLocalizationContext(model, request);          	// Fill the report.     	JasperPrint filledReport = fillReport(model);     	postProcessReport(filledReport, model);          	// Prepare response and render report.     	response.reset();     	populateHeaders(response);     	renderReport(filledReport, model, response);     }  I don't understand actually why do we need to call the reset method? The reset method call clears all the previous headers in the response (which includes the cache headers set previously in WebContentGenerator). Setting the headers manually in the view cause no problem as after the reset call, in the populateHeaders method headers are added from view's headers property (so the cache headers are set again if you add those to headers property prior).  Code:  private void populateHeaders(HttpServletResponse response) { // Apply the headers to the response. for (Enumeration en = this.headers.propertyNames(); en.hasMoreElements();) { String key = (String) en.nextElement(); response.addHeader(key, this.headers.getProperty(key)); } }  Rob, Juergen - Is this a problem? Is the reset call necessary? If it's necessary then shouldn't we check the cache headers before resetting the response and keep somewhere to add again later?  ---  **Affects:** 2.0.5, 2.5 final  **Attachments:** - [testReport.txt](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13598/testReport.txt) (_1.28 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #5645 Fix HTTPS handling for JasperReports in IE","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-12T14:56:30Z","2019-01-13T22:40:39Z"

Something along the lines of extracting the convertToScriptSource() method in ScriptFactoryPostProcessor into a pluggable strategy, with perhaps a default if you don't want to do  anything more than inline or Resource-based scripts. So maybe there would be a ScriptLocator interface which you could plug into the ScriptFactoryPostProcessor rather than needing to subclass SFPP and override the protected convertToScriptSource method, which I did to allow scripts to be loaded from a database.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5  7 votes, 8 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-20T01:34:44Z","2015-09-22T17:34:39Z"

It would be beneficial to be able to configure different strategies for determining if a profile value is enabled for the current environment. The above classes could then delegate to the configured strategy. For backwards compatibility, the default strategy should simply delegate to ProfileValueUtils.isTestEnabledInThisEnvironment(); whereas, additional, pluggable strategies (e.g., one using regular expressions) could be provided for greater flexibility.  Further input from #10572:  It is a typical situation when one might have to run a combination of tests belonging to different test-groups.

JSP and other view technologies include this functionality by default.  Unless the parameters are returned in the XSLT Source, there is no way to access their values to display on the page or evaluate in logical operations.    An example might be a paging-type application such as a catalog.  A querystring might contain the page number the user is currently on, such as ""...?page=1"".  If you could access the querystring such as , you could display or evaluate it.  This fix is not critical, however, as this can be worked around by the developer placing the request object in the ModelAndView map and creating a custom XSLT View extended from AbstractXSLTView and building a node structure for the request parameters and adding it to the Source object.  This would simply be an added convenience to match the functionality of JSP and other view technologies without extra coding.  Two concerns about adding this functionality might include the overhead of placing these parameters in the view, and the second might be caching the view.   ---  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-23T12:18:52Z","2012-06-19T09:36:29Z"

I also noticed that in the HTTP response, the Content-Language header doesn't match the current locale (e.g. it still shows the platform default locale, not the locale that was set using the Accept-Language header).

This is in contradiction of the documentation in the reference guide:  ---  3.3.6.1. Excluding a bean from being available for autowiring  You can also (on a per-bean basis) totally exclude a bean from being an autowire candidate. When configuring beans using Spring's XML format, the 'autowire-candidate' attribute of the \ element can be set to 'false'; this has the effect of making the container totally exclude that specific bean definition from being available to the autowiring infrastructure.  This can be useful when you have a bean that you absolutely never ever want to have injected into other beans via autowiring. It does not mean that the excluded bean cannot itself be configured using autowiring... it can, it is rather that it itself will not be considered as a candidate for autowiring other beans.  ---  Please either clarify this behaviour in the reference guide if this is an intended behaviour (though I can't imagine why) or simply modify the above conditional  ---  **Affects:** 2.0.8  **Issue Links:** - #9444 DefaultListableBeanFactory.isPrimary() doesn't locate beans in parent contexts","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-05-05T01:27:17Z","2019-01-13T21:52:36Z"

The symptoms are random NullPointerExceptions being thrown due to the autowiring of beans not being performed.  The problem is due to the RootBeanDefinition of prototypes being initialized by more then one thread.  The problem exists in 2.5.1 and also 2.5.4. It may exist in other releases but these are the two I looked at.  The problem starts when two threads try to create a prototype bean of the same type.  For example:  MyWebController uses the following code to get a referecne to the prototype bean MyService.  MyService emailService = (MyService)getApplicationContext().getBean( ""MyService"");  MyService has an autowired property which is a singleton DAO named MyDAO.  `@Service`(""MyService"") `@Scope`(""prototype"") public class MyService_Impl implements MyService {      @Autowired     @Qualifier(""MyDAO"")     private MyDAO myDAO          . . .  }  The problem occurs when two threads try to get an instance for the first time to the MyService bean. The myDAO is NOT autowired.  In the spring libraries, the problem starts when two threads enter the following method during a request to create the prototype bean MyService.  org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.doCreateBean()  The method looks like this...  protected Object doCreateBean(final String beanName, final RootBeanDefinition mbd, final Object[] args) {      . . .          // Allow post-processors to modify the merged bean definition.     if(!mbd.postProcessed)     {     	applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors(mbd, beanType, beanName);     	mbd.postProcessed = true;     }          . . .  }  If more then two threads enter the applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors() for the same RootBeanDefinition at the same time, the properties (fields) to be autowired (injected) are lost.  The best way to see this is set a break point inside of doCreateBean() and allow two threads to enter the  applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors() one at a time. Note that the check ""if(!mbd.postProcessed)"" is NOT thread safe if two threads have already entered the if() statement.  The applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors() method is used to allow Bean Post Processers to have their postProcessMergedBeanDefinition() called.  When using the autowire annotation, the org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor is registered.  For the MyService bean, the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean has its postProcessMergedBeanDefinition() called.  In the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.postProcessMergedBeanDefinition() method the findAutowiringMetadata() method is called. The findAutowiringMetadata() is used to get the InjectionMetadata for the bean and store this object into a local cache in the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.injectionMetadataCache map field.  The InjectionMetadata contains members, both fields and methods that need to be autowired (injected) for this bean.  When the first thread enters this code, this works fine and returns the InjectionMetadata.  NOTE THAT THIS INSTANCE of InjectionMetadata IS CACHED IN THE ""AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.injectionMetadataCache map field"". As you will see below, the InjectionMetadata object in the map will be modified later.  Back in the postProcessMergedBeanDefinition() after the InjectionMetadata has been returned the following is called:  metadata.checkConfigMembers(beanDefinition);  Inside of checkConfigMembers() it calls:  doRegisterConfigMembers(beanDefinition, this.injectedFields);  Here the fields to be autowired are merged into the beanDefinition if it does not exist (see code below).  If it does exist, IT IS REMOVED from the input set ""this.injectedFields"" (The cause of the problem).  private void doRegisterConfigMembers(RootBeanDefinition beanDefinition, Set\ members) { for (Iterator\ it = members.iterator(); it.hasNext();) { Member member = it.next().getMember(); if (!beanDefinition.isExternallyManagedConfigMember(member)) { beanDefinition.registerExternallyManagedConfigMember(member); } else { it.remove(); } } }  For a single thread initializing this beanDefinition this is okay.  The problem is when another thread is also trying to initialize the same beanDefinition. Looking at the logic above, if the ""Member"" is already in the bean definition it is removed from the input Set of InjectedElements (see ""it.remove()"" from above). This Set of  InjectedElements is the same set cached in the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.injectionMetadataCache map.  So, the beanDefinition (RootBeanDefinition.externallyManagedConfigMembers) is CORRECT but the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.injectionMetadataCache map field no longer has this member as a field to be autowired.  Future calls to findAutowiringMetadata() will return an InjectionMetadata from its cache but the fields (member) to be autowired will not exist.  So when it comes time to inject other beans into this bean (like the myDAO bean), and the findAutowiringMetadata() is called, the information about what fields of a bean should be autowired is lost and therefore, those properties will not be injected and will be null.  The fix I have is to only allow a single thread to ever perform a ""merge bean definition post process"".  This can be accomplished by modifying the following method:  org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.doCreateBean()  The change will replace the none-thread safe call with...  protected Object doCreateBean(final String beanName, final RootBeanDefinition mbd, final Object[] args) {      . . .               // Allow post-processors to modify the merged bean definition.     if (!mbd.postProcessed)      {     	synchronized(mbd)     	{     		if (!mbd.postProcessed)     		{     			applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors(mbd, beanType, beanName);     			mbd.postProcessed = true;     		}     	}     }          . . .  }  I have tested this and it seems to work. My concern is the synchronization on the mbd itself. This seems like a good candidate to synch on but I am not sure what the impact will be if it is being synch on in other parts of the code. My concern would be a deadlock.    ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-06-18T09:39:32Z","2012-06-19T03:47:40Z"

Especially important capability is injecting dependencies after deserialization. This precludes users from creating useful subaspect of AbstractBeanConfigurerAspect unless they duplicate the functionality in AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect. This, in turn, precludes some interesting possibilities such as: - Injecting dependencies based on user-specific annotations. - Injecting based on user-specified interfaces (e.g. Injecting MailServer for objects implementing MailClient). - User specified configuration strategy (that can bypass Spring's reflection based strategy).  While making backwards compatible changes is ideal in some respect, it is probably going to end up making the design too complex (already we have some complexities such as non-abstract pointcut that must be overriden). So perhaps a better choice is to: 1. Create a new aspect, say, AbstractDependencyInjectionAspect with consideration for all things mentioned above. 2. Deprecate AbstractBeanConfigurerAspect.    This shouldn't be a real issue for any existing users as their subaspects of AbstractDependencyInjectionAspect, if any, will continue to work the same way. 3. Refactor AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect to extend AbstractDependencyInjectionAspect.    Since AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect is a concrete aspect (which cannot be extended further), there is no issue with user extensions to it. Further, most (all?) Spring users use this aspect to  or  anyway, making internal details umimportant to them.  ---  **Issue Links:** - #8980 Deserialization not reinjecting for `@Configurable` with preConstruction - #8981 Repeated configuration for `@Configurable` with preConstruction","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-07T00:52:02Z","2019-01-13T08:05:59Z"

This has a number of downsides: 1) it takes more time because of copying overhead and such 2) the client needs to allocate the byte array needed to serialize the remote call  overall this issue has a great impact on performance.  Central to the HttpInvokerExecutor is the abstract base class AbstractHttpInvokerRequestExecutor with its method 	protected abstract RemoteInvocationResult doExecuteRequest( HttpInvokerClientConfiguration config, ByteArrayOutputStream baos)  I propose to change this method to something like protected abstract RemoteInvocationResult doExecuteRequest( HttpInvokerClientConfiguration config, RemoteInvocation invocation)  to give the actual implementations the freedom deal with the RemoteInvocation rather than the byte array. Then CommonsHttpInvokerRequestExecutor.java and SimpleHttpInvokerRequestExecutor.java can easily be modified to take advantage of chunking.  I have done the changes in the attached ZIP file, they should be reviewed since I couldn't test them yet. They are basically derived from a version I made for Spring 1.2.9, and there it works fine using commons httpinvoker.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5  **Attachments:** - [httpinvoker_chunking.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14597/httpinvoker_chunking.zip) (_9.66 kB_)  1 votes, 4 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-25T04:29:24Z","2015-09-22T17:34:37Z"

After upgrading to Spring 2.5.5 the error message is gone again, although I haven't changed anything in the Spring Bean definitions.

The form:form tag currently does not support the 'target' attribute as defined in the HTML 4.01 specification here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.3  This means that users desiring this functionality must resort to a kludgey Javascript-based workaround such as those discussed in the following two forum threads: http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=44044 http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=46730  The lack of this tag does hamper the ability of a Spring-managed form to be part of some types of dynamic web applications. This really should be fixed, since the fix is simply to add a single attribute to FormTag.java and the TLD.

Since this has been an undocumented feature - I am not sure whether this is actually a real bug, but we will still depend on this feature. Our current workaround is to extend ContextLoader and ContextLoaderListener, and provide an implementation of the customizeContext method where we can resolve the System properties ourselves.  The only difference I can find is that in 2.5.1 the ContextLoader.createWebApplicationContext() method would invoke the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.setConfigLocations() method with the configLocations from web.xml. In 2.5.2 this was changed to invoke the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.setConfigLocation() (notice the plural/singural difference here).

Calling a stored procedure on the iSeries with 1 input parameter and 3 output parameters, using JDBC template and ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper as follows:  getInsuranceTransactionsSP = new SimpleJdbcCall(jdbcTemplate) .withProcedureName(SP_GETINSURANCE).withSchemaName( defaultSchema).returningResultSet( ""transactions"", ParameterizedBeanPropertyRowMapper .newInstance(InsuranceTransaction.class));  This worked fine in Spring 2.5.1  In 2.5.2 it no longer works.  This is because when it calls the stored procedure, it calls it with both the input AND the output parameters, rather than just the input.  As a result the JDBC driver throws an exception (trace shown at end)  Looking at the code for JDBCTemplate it seems that this method:  public Map call(CallableStatementCreator csc, List declaredParameters) throws DataAccessException  is not checking to see whether a whether a declared parameter is an instance of SQLOutParameter. It should not call callParameters.add(parameter); if the parameter is an out parameter.  I have tried the same test against MySQL and this is OK, it is only on DB2 for iSeries that I am having the problem.

I have an interface called SomeService with one method doSomeWork(Integer someArgument). I have an abstract class SomeAbstractService that implements the interface's method doSomeWork(Integer someArgument). This method implementation calls another method which is abstract and is called doSomeWork(Integer someArgument, Object someOtherArgument). Then I have another class called SomeConcreteService extending the abstract class but located in another package than the abstract class. When an aspect is defined on SomeConcreteService to target the interface implemented by the subclass it doesn't work, the aspect doesn't get called. A workaround is to place the concrete class in the same package as the abstract class or in a subpackage and update the aspect pointcut to include the package from the abstract class. Another option is to override the doSomeWork(Integer someArgument) in the SomeConcreteSerivice then it does work. I could Imagine though that in many framework this is not possible as the method doSomework(Integer someArgument)  would be final in the abstract class. I was expecting if I call a method on that service it would be proxied even if the method is declared in a super class. I did after all specify in the pointcut that I want all methods proxied including any method from the super class that might implement an interface method.

If the JstlView can't find a requested view, a 404 status will be set to the HttpServletResponse which is then handled by the web container. This is done by the RequestDispatcher that is used in the renderMergedOutputModel method of InternalResourceView. In the case of TilesView this is totally different. If the requested view doesn't exist (because there's no tiles definition with that name), a org.apache.tiles.definition.DefinitionsFactoryException is thrown which results in a 500 server error. I'd suggest to catch that exception in TilesView (when calling the TilesContainer's render method) and set a 404 error-code in the HttpServletResponse. Of course this could affect existing code, but I can't imagine that it would break, because the change would just be a 500 -> 404 error code change. Neither spring's JavaDoc nor the documentation does contain a note about the desired ""view not found"" behaviour - at least I couldn't find it, so I don't know what is really wanted.

To do that without too much magic I would like to be able to specify prefix free resource paths to the resources (for example the location of my hibernate mapping directory) in my bean definitions and have the web environment supply me with a resource loader that understands webapps and have the test cases use a FilesystemResourceLoader that locates the files properly when executing stanalone.  Unfortunately, if I subclass AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests the ApplicationContext that is created tries to resolve prefix-less resources in the classpath (and fails at that).  My current solution is override (and copy) the whole content of AbstractSingleSpringContextTests.createApplicationContext() and add an setResourceLoader(new FileSystemResourceLoader()) invocation between the GenericApplicationContext() constructor invocation and loadBeanDefinitions().  This solution is kind of convoluted and possibly breaks in unpredictable ways as soon as super.createApplicationContext() gets changed.  Proposed solution:  Add an overridable method AbstractSingleContextTest.createResourceLoader() that per default returns a ClasspathResourceLoader and configures the GenericApplicationContext with that before it loads it's bean definitions. Users like me then can override this method in our tests and return for example a FilesystemResourceLoader instead.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.3","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-04-20T05:53:09Z","2012-06-19T03:46:39Z"

If the CustomNumberEditor is constructed with no NumberFormat the \.decode method is called to parse the entered number. The behaviour of these classes it to treat any values with a leading 0 as an octal. As such 08 and 09 will create Number Format Exceptions.  I am not sure if this will be classed as a bug but it may be nice to change the implementation to use the apache NumberUtils createNumber style implementation where leading zeros are not interpreted as octal. Most users filling in web forms will not enter an octal.

As a result, when trying to serialize objects proxied for transactions, a NotSerializableException is thrown. (It also holds a non-transient reference to a DataSource).  From the source-code as well as from the javadocs, I understand that the TransactionInterceptor class was designed for serialization (as well as proxies in general) . However, in its writeObject method it attempts to serialize the transactionManager as is, which in the case of the HibernateTransactionManager, throws the exception.  This seems to me like a bug. The implication of the problem is that it is impossible to deploy in a cluster that employs session-replication. However, since there is a workaround I prioritize this as - Minor.  This is a workaround:  public class SerializableHibernateTransactionManager extends HibernateTransactionManager implements ApplicationContextAware { private static ApplicationContext applicationContext;      private Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException     {         logger.debug("""");                  /*          * null the non-transient references to these non-serializable objects          * before serialization (so that serialization does not fail).          */         super.setBeanFactory(null);         super.setDataSource(null);              return this;     }          private Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException     {         logger.debug("""");              /*          * discard the de-serialized object, since it is missing the beanFactory and dataSource,          * and obtain the bean from Spring, and return it instead.

Looked at the Javadocs, forums, etc. until asked a colleague who actually had traced this to Spring sources once after killing numerous hours. I think the Javadoc (and maybe the manual as well) must be improved to make this more clear.  The situation is simple: SimpleFormController handles a form submission, and needs to redirect to an external page/URL after it's done. The missing chain I (and most of other people I presume) missed there is to set the ""redirectAction"" to true. However, the crucial bit is that calling setRedirectAction( true ) is simply not enough - it needs to be called early, and preferably set in the portlet configuration. This, in my opinion, **must** be clearly explained in the header of Javadoc of org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView class, and possibly in the description of the redirectAction attribute itself.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-09-03T20:46:26Z","2012-06-19T03:46:48Z"

"","9157","RequestContextListener issue with session-scoped bean and forbidden resource in JSF [SPR-4480]","**[Mike Hanafey](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hanafey)** opened **[SPR-4480](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4480?redirect=false)** and commented  Using Glassfish v2, JSF 1.2, Spring 2.5, configured JSF access to spring beans via the standard delegating resolver, allowing for session scoped beans via org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener.  Most things worked as expected, except for the following case:  Part of the web app requires a specific role, which causes error code 403 on unauthorized access, and a JSF page is specified to be shown on a 403. This page contains a reference to the session scoped bean. When page is displayed because of the 403 error then RequestContextHolder throws the IllegalStateException in the currentRequestAttributes method, complaining about the probable need for a RequestContextListener.  The problem is the RequestContextListener did in fact store the attributes in the thread local variable, but this occurred under a different thread than the thread running when the bean access is attempted. This same page displays perfectly well if its URL is entered directly in the browser. The problem is clearly because the RequestContextListener runs as a different thread from the thread that ultimately displays the page as specified by the error page directive.  I don't know if this is a problem with Glassfish not adhering to the servlet spec, or if this is an issue with the RequestContextListener idea. The current problem arises under a narrow set of conditions, but it raises the concern that there may be other circumstances where relying on a threadlocal variable for the complete request cycle may fail.  The essential configuration is shown below, followed by the appserver traceback.

In the specific case, the example would read something like:  simpleReport.subReportUrls=ProductsSubReport=/WEB-INF/reports/subReportChild.jrxml  Failure to understand this subtlety leads to incorrect configuration that leads to a confusing error message (perhaps worth of another small jira) on the lines of 'Report URL [/WEB-INF/reports/DataSourceReport.jrxml] must either in .jasper or .jrxml' thrown from AbstractJasperReportsView.java:529.

This is somewhat of a problem when using the SimpleJdbcTemplate and trying to use these operations, because it allows the recovery of the wrapped JdbcTemplate only as JdbcOperations. Of course one can then explicitely cast to JdbcTemplate so this is relatively minor. Another small problem with setFetchSize not being in the interface is difficulty with mocking when this operation is used, whatever one might say about the idea of mocking the database layer.  Are there important reasons why JdbcTemplate has such methods not declared in JdbcOperations, or may they be aded to the interface?   ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-05T01:41:35Z","2015-09-22T17:34:37Z"

In both cases I need to get the lastModified timestamp of the resources (if available).  Currently I have to deal with different resource types to get the lastModified. But think this shold be implemented within resources. Otherwise it could be implemented in ResourceUtils but that makes it harder to implement it.  The getLastModified() function should return 0L when the value is not availabe (e.g. in case of StreamResources) or if it's a heavyweight operation to get the vaule (i.e for http urls where a http request would be required). Or method could have a boolean parameter which allows to do heavyweight operations like http requests to retrieve the value.  - for FileSystemResource lastModified() of the underlying file needs to be called (easy to implement) - for ClassPathResource - if it's a file - lastModified() needs to be called (also easy to implement) - for ClassPathResource - if it's something a jar - ResourceUtils.extractJarFileURL() needs to be called until we get a resource that is not in a jar file (also easy to implement) - for any other resource a decision must be made weather to implement this or to simply return 0L  Having a getLastModified() allows to implement ResourceMonitors which sends events when a resource was changed.

The code is quite simple and could be added to ResoureUtils:      public static String applyPath(String base, String sub)     {         if (sub==null) return base;         if (base==null || ResourceUtils.isUrl(sub)) return sub;              String prefix;         String basePath;                  if (base.startsWith(ResourceUtils.CLASSPATH_URL_PREFIX))         {             basePath=base.substring(ResourceUtils.CLASSPATH_URL_PREFIX.length());             prefix=ResourceUtils.CLASSPATH_URL_PREFIX;         }         else if (ResourceUtils.isUrl(base))         {             int pos=base.indexOf(':')+1;             basePath=base.substring(pos);             prefix=base.substring(0,pos);         }         else         {             basePath=base;             prefix="""";         }                  if (sub.startsWith(""/"")) basePath=sub;         else basePath=StringUtils.applyRelativePath(basePath, sub);                  return prefix+StringUtils.cleanPath(basePath);     }    ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1  **Attachments:** - [ResourceHelperTests.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13755/ResourceHelperTests.java) (_5.65 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-26T07:14:51Z","2015-09-22T17:34:36Z"

This is caused by the JPA detection code in AnnotationConfigUtils, which determines whether or not to register the JPA bean post processor in this fashion:  private static final boolean jpaPresent = ClassUtils.isPresent(""javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory"", AnnotationConfigUtils.class.getClassLoader()) && ClassUtils.isPresent(PERSISTENCE_ANNOTATION_PROCESSOR_CLASS_NAME, AnnotationConfigUtils.class.getClassLoader());  As you can see, it is using the classloader of the AnnotationConfigUtils class, which can see the JPA package due to the optional import in spring-core's manifest.  This should use the classloader of the bundle that declares , perhaps using the thread context class loader?

This has zero direct benefit (it's already guaranteed to be unique, and entry-sets are directly inquireable), and thus I can only imagine that it was meant to force a walk through the model map's collections; possibly to force materialization of lazy objects.  The negative side effect is that it's very slow for large lists, since it triggers walking iterators recursively.  This WILL spider-web throughout all lazily instantiated objects and collections, by invoking all their hashCode() functions in turn.  I noticed this when I produced explicit Lazily initialized collections which only hit hibernate when their accessor methods are called.  It allows me to have one controller with many 'optional' Model attributes.  My solution to this was to override the AbstractXXX collection class's hashCode and equals methods - preventing them from walking their respective collections.  Since someone went out of their way to produce this wrapper HashSet, is there is valid reason?

Unfortunately, Hibernate Search's FullTextSessionImpl assumes that it will be passed an org.hibernate.classic.Session. When using Spring for Hibernate transaction management, Spring creates a defensive Proxy that disables the Session.close() method. This Proxy does not implement the EventSource nor classic.Session, while Hibernate Search assumes that it does and has a ClassCastException in the FullTextSessionImpl constructor.  Hibernate Search's FullTextSessionImpl does this which is wrong for the Spring Hibernate Session Proxy:  public FullTextSessionImpl(org.hibernate.Session session) { this.session = (Session) session; // classic.Session! this.eventSource = (EventSource) session; this.sessionImplementor = (SessionImplementor) session; }  The Spring code in question is in HibernateTemplate.createSessionProxy:      protected Session createSessionProxy(Session session) {     	Class[] sessionIfcs = null;     	if (session instanceof SessionImplementor) {     		sessionIfcs = new Class[] {Session.class, SessionImplementor.class};     	}     	else {     		sessionIfcs = new Class[] {Session.class};     	}     	return (Session) Proxy.newProxyInstance(     			getClass().getClassLoader(), sessionIfcs,     			new CloseSuppressingInvocationHandler(session));     }  Modifying that code to detect and implement the org.hibernate.classic.Session and EventSource interfaces will allow easier integration with Hibernate Search.  The workaround for this is to use HibernateTemplate.setExposeNativeSession( true ) before executing the HibernateCallback (causing the SessionImpl to be passed directly, without a Proxy). This exposes the Session to potential close() and is **not** a good idea.

"","9806","Database connection problems cause Spring to raise an IllegalStateException and resulting in transaction state not being cleaned up [SPR-5133]","**[Matt Doran](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=matt_doran)** opened **[SPR-5133](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-5133?redirect=false)** and commented  We have customers encounter a strange ""Pre-bound JDBC Connection found!"", even though we only ever use the HibernateTransactionManager, and never any JDBC transaction manager.  This error has happened with a number of our customers, but we have been unable to reproduce it in house.  From some client logs, I noticed that this error only started appearing after the backend database was down for a period.  So there were lots of errors indicating that transactions could not be started.  After the database came online the ""Pre-bound JDBC Connection found!"" started occurring.  The background on this issue can be found at the following forum thread (I was receiving help from Martin Deinum, and he asked me to raise the issue here).  http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=59316  So I decided to try to reproduce the problem by deliberately bringing down the database connection, and trying to perform transactions.  Although I was unable to produce the identical behaviour, I could reproduce a situation that would cause Spring to throw an IllegalStateException in the ""TransactionSynchronizationManager.clearSynchronization()"" method.  This method is called from AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.cleanupAfterCompletion().   When this exception is raised the remainder if this method will not run, so the transaction cleanup method ""doCleanupAfterCompletion"" will not be called and the suspended resources would not be resumed.  So it's possible that these connection errors cause the transaction state from a previous transaction to be left behind ... and when Spring finds the pre-bound connection from the previous transaction it raises the above error.  It's only a theory, but it sounds plausible.  I have been able to create a simple reproduction recipe.  It shows that instead of getting an exception explaining that a connection cannot be established, you get a ""java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot deactivate transaction synchronization - not active"" instead.  I will attach the reproduction after creating the issue.  It is in the form of an Eclipse project ...all you need to do is run the ""springdbrepro.Main"" class.  You do not need to setup any databases, etc.  NOTE: I have tried this in 2.0.8 and it does not produce the IllegalStateException.  I did not test this in 2.5, because our code is using Hibernate 3.0.5 which is not supported in the later versions of Spring.  I might upgrade to 2.0.8 ... but I thought it would be worth raising this issue ... because this problem could be lurking in future versions too.  ---  **Affects:** 1.2.9  **Attachments:** - [spring-db-repro.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14628/spring-db-repro.zip) (_5.04 MB_)  **Issue Links:** - #8374 HibernateTransactionManager doesn't clean up when connection not available","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-09-01T00:06:10Z","2019-01-11T15:37:55Z"

For instance, if I have a java.lang.Long property that is mapped to a database column with a null value in it, the bean property will get set to '0' instead of 'null'.  It would be nice if this handled null instead of being forced to use BigDecimal in order to get handling of nulls.  This could be accomplished by calling RecordSet.wasNull() to check for null values.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-11T05:45:44Z","2012-06-19T03:47:18Z"

This is because the MethodInvokingJob catches all exceptions thrown by the invoked method (InvocationTargetExceptions), and then re-throws them as JobExecutionExceptions. Quartz apparently considers those to be ""expected exceptions"" that are used for scheduling purposes, and as such they are only logged as INFO.  Spring's MethodInvokingJob should probably find out if the thrown exceptions was a runtime exception, and re-throw it, and simply wrap checked exceptions in an appropriate RuntimeException and rethrow them. JobExecutionExceptions are apparently reserved for other purposes.  Also, you should probably not log an exception that you are re-throwing anyways, that only gives duplicate log entries, making a potential problem harder to find.   ---  **Affects:** 2.0.8, 2.5.1  **Backported to:** [2.0.9](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/46?closed=1)","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-26T19:25:29Z","2012-06-19T03:47:29Z"

As fallback, when no Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY property has been set, the old behaviour will be used.

Add a reference to section 6.6.1.  Reason  ---  From section 9.5 - Declarative transaction management. ""AOP concepts do not generally have to be understood to make effective use of this code"". This discourages the user from reading the relevant AOP section (6.6), as AOP ""does not generally have to be understood.""  From section 9.5.6 ""The `@Transactional` annotation may be placed before an interface definition, a method on an interface, a class definition, or a public method on a class."" This is not entirely true.  If the public method is not invoked via a proxy, then the `@Transactional` annotation will not be applied.  In this case, code may also have to be refactored; yet the reference document implies you simply add the `@Transactional` annotation.  Whilst many users will have read and understood section 6.6.1, it does no harm to explicitly emphasise the relevance of section 6.6.1 to transactional annotations - especially as Spring is modular in nature and few users will have consumed the entire reference manual.  ---  **Affects:** 2.0.7, 2.5 final  **Backported to:** [2.0.8](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/45?closed=1)","closed","type: documentation,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-05T19:41:06Z","2019-01-13T08:06:13Z"

The root of the issue is that the current thread's context classloader doesn't get set: a couple of resources suggest that it is due to the -XstartOnFirstThread parameter needed by Eclipse to run SWT, so the problem ultimately lies with Apple's Java VM.

Apologies for the description, but I'll try to explain.  I'm using the Spring Test Context, to perform Load Time Weaving within the boundaries of the test, to allow the injection of dependencies into `@Configurable` Domain Objects.  This works fine, unless some generic declaration references a super type of the `@Configurable` class, even if this declararion is not executed. Looking at the output from the Load Time Weaver, the Configurable class is no longer woven, leading me to assume that it has been class loaded prior to the instantiation of the Spring Application Context, and therefore before weaving has been turned on.  I will attach a test case that hopefully shows the problem.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  **Attachments:** - [springsrc.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14258/springsrc.zip) (_4.90 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #9811 `@Configurable` does not work when type is already loaded due to Java bytecode verification  9 votes, 10 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2008-06-27T01:13:06Z","2019-01-13T08:03:31Z"

The DataSource to expose the transactions for needs to be specified explicitly; it won't be autodetected.""  In order to generate and call some anonymous PL/SQL blocks (to deal with Oracle associative arrays used in legacy code) we are using JdbcDaoSupport. The rest of our app used TopLinkDaoSupport.  I saw in the documentation that Toplink transaction can be exposed to JDBC, but I think that this will never occur due to the SessionFactory creating a Proxy aound the Session, whilst checks within the ToplinkTransactionManager to retrieve the JDBCConnection assume a ClientSession.  Stepping through doBegin in TopLinkTransactionManager I think shows that a jdbcConnection will never be retrieved from a Writeable Toplink Client Session.  TopLinkTransactionManager.doBegin Code: if (!definition.isReadOnly()) { logger.debug(""Creating managed TopLink Session with active UnitOfWork for read-write transaction""); session = getSessionFactory().createManagedClientSession(); }  ServerSessionFactory.createManagedClientSession (in AbstractSessionFactory) Code: logger.debug(""Creating managed TopLink client Session""); return (Session) Proxy.newProxyInstance( getClass().getClassLoader(), new Class[] {Session.class}, new ManagedClientInvocationHandler(createClientSession()));  But later in TopLinkTransactionManager.doBegin it calls getJdbcConnection Code: if (!(session instanceof oracle.toplink.publicinterface.Session)) { if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) { logger.debug(""TopLink Session ["" + session +""] does not derive from [oracle.toplink.publicinterface.Session]""); } return null;  Unless I'm mistaken (a big risk!), a writeable Toplink Session will never be able to provide the JDBC Connection to the JdbcDaoSupport, as it's an instance of Proxy (notSession).  Is this expected behaviour, meaning that the ToplinkTransactionManager.getJdbcConnection should be overridden to deal with the Proxy instance, or is it a bug within the Spring-Toplink Integration layer.  As always, many thanks for investigating.

Currently, there is support for ""System"" properties, but in a Java EE environment it is often necessary to grab such variables from JNDI.  Case and point is your Log4jWebConfigurer class uses SystemPropertiesUtils for certain system variables.  However, we had to override this class in order for it to support derivation of the which log4j file to use based on the environment we are in.  Using JNDI, we can set and determine which environment we are in instead of setting a system variable which is often frowned on by admins.  Hopefully this can be considered for a future release so we don't have to override this class.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  **Attachments:** - [SystemPropertyUtils.diff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14542/SystemPropertyUtils.diff) (_546 bytes_)  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-13T10:49:54Z","2012-06-19T09:36:24Z"

Upon further inspection, on lines 1041-1043, I see this:  // Only cache the merged bean definition if we're already about to create an // instance of the bean, or at least have already created an instance before. if (containingBd == null && isCacheBeanMetadata() && this.alreadyCreated.contains(beanName)) { this.mergedBeanDefinitions.put(beanName, mbd); }  Note how the logic in the predicate belies what the comment is saying. If I read the comment correctly, it's really saying this:  if (isCacheBeanMetadata() && (containingBd == null ||  this.alreadyCreated.contains(beanName))) { this.mergedBeanDefinitions.put(beanName, mbd); }  When I change the code to do this, I no longer experience lock contention because my beans are now cached in mergedBeanDefinitions, and my pages show up quite quickly (from 10 seconds to ~1-2).  I'm not terribly familiar with the internals of Spring so I'm not sure if this is correct. Plus I'm using `@SpringBean` in Wicket which may be part of the problem, but even so this seems like a serious issue with the code path here, particularly with the predicate logic above and the level of lock contention I was observing -- with 40 threads issuing requests against my webapp I was seeing latencies of up to 500 ms on this single lock.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-26T14:26:47Z","2012-06-19T03:46:49Z"

This can be rather time consuming as the integration tests excercise more heavy weight services than is otherwise the case with normal unit tests.  The following unit test highlights the problem:  ``` import static junit.framework.Assert.assertNotNull;  import org.junit.Test; import org.junit.runner.RunWith; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.test.annotation.IfProfileValue; import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration; import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringJUnit4ClassRunner;  @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = { ""/nonExistingAppCtx.xml"" }) @IfProfileValue(name = ""test-group"", value = ""integration"") public class IntegrationTest {  	@Autowired 	String myNonExistingApplicationContextBean;  	@Test 	public void test() { 		assertNotNull(myNonExistingApplicationContextBean); 	} } ```  The test class should only be run if the test-group system property is set. The expected behaviour when running the test should IMHO be that to report that the testclass contained 1 ignored test. If the test class is run with the test-group property set, it should throw exceptions as the context configuration does not point to a valid application context.  When running the code with Spring 2.5.5 without setting the test-group property, an exception is instead thrown as the the app context is still attempted loaded and dependency injection is attempted.  This is due to the behaviour of createTest in SpringJUnit4ClassRunner which does not check if the testclass should be run at all:  ``` /**  * Delegates to {@link JUnit4ClassRunner#createTest()} to create the test  * instance and then to a {@link TestContextManager} to  * {@link TestContextManager#prepareTestInstance(Object) prepare} the test  * instance for Spring testing functionality.  * @see JUnit4ClassRunner#createTest()  * @see TestContextManager#prepareTestInstance(Object)  */ @Override protected Object createTest() throws Exception { 	Object testInstance = super.createTest(); 	getTestContextManager().prepareTestInstance(testInstance); 	return testInstance; } ```  The call to prepareTestInstance causes all the test execution listeners to fire, and inject the dependencies. By making a simple guard check to see if any methods should be processed at all, the problem can be eliminated. Alternatively it could be part of the TestContextManager's responsibility.  I hope that my explanation is complete enough to give you an understanding of the issue.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5  **Attachments:** - [IntegrationTest.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14469/IntegrationTest.java) (_605 bytes_)  **Issue Links:** - #10571 Class-level `@IfProfileValue` overrides method-level `@IfProfileValue` settings","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-28T07:21:22Z","2019-01-13T08:03:07Z"

This order is determined by the order of the Java classpath, in which entities that appear earlier typically hide those that appear later.  When an application context loads bean definitions, however, later declarations override earlier ones.  Thus we have a mismatch in the semantics of a classpath (first one wins) and bean definition loading (last one wins).  A common practice in deployed systems is to set up a directory for configuration overrides (usually properties files) at the beginning of the classpath.  This practice is incompatible with the use of ""classpath*:"" unless the additional configurations are strictly additive rather than overlapping.  The proposed solution is simply to reverse the order of resources returned by ClassLoader.getResources before returning them from PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver.findAllClassPathResources.  This change would remain compatible with strictly additive uses of ""classpath*:"" while resolving the mismatch in ordering semantics.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  **Attachments:** - [patch.txt](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14043/patch.txt) (_957 bytes_) - [SPR-4792.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14069/SPR-4792.patch) (_1.74 kB_)  0 votes, 6 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2008-05-09T01:09:35Z","2019-01-12T02:38:30Z"

"","9866","Some implementation of HandlerExceptionResolver should allow for a list of Exceptions to be ignored [SPR-5193]","**[Kent Rancourt](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=krancour)** opened **[SPR-5193](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-5193?redirect=false)** and commented  SimpleMappingExceptionResolver is the only implementation of HandlerExceptionResolver packaged with Spring.  It permits mapping of specific exceptions (subclasses and their subclasses) to specific views.  What this does **not** account for is the ability to ignore/rethrow specific exceptions.  While this would generally be a beneficial feature, it's **especially** important for those who are using both Spring MVC **and** Spring Security.  Spring Security's ExceptionTranslationFilter is far better suited for properly handling exceptions indicative of authentication or authorization failures- for example, an AccessDeniedException because user lacks the correct role.  Without an implementation of  HandlerExceptionResolver that is capable of ignoring/rethrowing such exceptions (or any exception(s) specified through configuration), the ExceptionTranslationFilter never gets the opportunity to do its job (i.e. redirect user to AuthenticationEntryPoint or send 403, depending on circumstances).  Marten Deinum indicated to me in the forum that I could address this gap by subclassing SimpleMappingExceptionResolver or providing my own alternate implementation of HandlerExceptionResolver.  The problems with such an approach are twofold:  1. The signature of the resolveException(...) method on the HandlerExceptionResolver  interface does **not** throw Throwable or Exception.  This means any attempt at subclassing SimpleMappingExceptionResolver or providing an alternate implementation of HandlerExceptionResolver can only successfully ignore/rethrow runtime exceptions.  While that is probably ok in most cases, it's not quite flexible enough for all use cases since method signatures in controllers can be very flexible and can (I believe) throw any type of exception.  2. Given Spring's popularity, I assume there are many developers using both Spring MVC and Spring security.  That entire population shouldn't have to implement a custom HandlerExceptionResolver just to ensure the ExceptionTranslationFilter can still do its job.  IMHO it wouldn't be optimal to encourage custom solutions to what I assume is a common problem when the feature could easily be included out-of-the-box instead.  Please strongly consider this improvment.  It would certainly help to streamline integration of two of SpringSource's top products.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/fbb2103e4d1279639957a7f0c43c1706ddfb754b  3 votes, 4 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-10-01T04:41:16Z","2012-06-19T03:47:02Z"

My use case would be for supplying request- or session-scoped beans to the handler method as arguments.  Currently, I would use aop scoped-proxies to supply scoped beans to a singleton controller, but by supplying them as arguments to the handler method, you remove the need to generate the proxy - it can supplied directly.

For example, take a `@Controller` which handles form submissions.  After a successful submission, the controller wants to pass control flow on to another controller.  Traditionally, you would return a forward or redirect back to the container, which would then re-dispatch to the other controller.  This is cumbersome, so instead you can inject the second controller into the first, and then directly invoke the second controller's handler method when you want to hand over control.  This is an improvement in some cases, and often gives more readable code, but it does mean giving controllers knowledge of one another, which isn't particularly nice.  You could instead define an interface to be implemented by the controllers, and inject that, but then if you're resorting to interfaces, why bother with annotations to start with.  So my suggestion is that AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter be extended to allow another type of return value from handler methods, specifically instances of another controller.  So controller A would be injected with controller B, but only as an Object.  It would think of it only as ""the thing to pass control flow to when I'm done"".  AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter  would examine the methods of that returned object for annotations which indicated that that method should accept control flow.  The method would then be treated as though it were the originally invoked `@RequestHandler` method, with all the same flexibility.  This would allow you to pass control along a chain of controllers without resorting to forwards and redirects.  It should be a fairly low-impact change, from what I can see of AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-05T08:36:16Z","2015-09-22T17:34:33Z"

I got it to work, but only after a lot of digging through the Spring source to find out how FactoryBeans and scoped-proxies interact.  My FactoryBean had been returning ""false"" from isSingleton(), which seemed to be consistent with the scope=""session"" in the bean definition.  Of course, what ended up happening was that the FactoryBean itself became session scoped, and every time my client code accessed the bean within the session, the BeanFactory created a new instance - the created instance itself was not session-scoped.  The fix is to return true from isSingleton(), and rely on the session-scoping of the FactoryBean to produce what is effectively a session-scoped, factory-created bean instance.  I hope I've described that OK.  I think the documentation could use some explicit notes about this.  (a) In the section on scoped-proxies, a mention that it is the Factorybean itself that is scoped, not the things it creates, and (b) in the section on FactoryBeans, a mention that the isSingleton() method refers to whether the instance created by the FactoryBean is a singleton within the lifetime of the FactoryBean, not the context.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-05T02:52:11Z","2012-06-19T03:47:30Z"

An example would be I have a FactoryBean which can throw a business logic exception during the creation of the object.  The factory bean is in the context as a scoped proxy.

This is fine, except I cannot then directly configure the original business logic exception in the SimpleMappingExceptionResolver.

I'd like to see this taken yet further, and I have a good use case for it.  In JBossAS, certain MBeans implement the org.jboss.system.ServiceMBean interface, which provides create/start/stop/destroy methods.  When wired up as part of JBoss's service framework, the container will invoke create and start on the bean **after** it has been registered with the JMS server, and then call stop and destroy **before** it is deregistered.  I would very much like to use MBeanExporter to perform the same lifecycle, so that the service can have full support from the Spring container, whilst participating in the JBoss service framework. In order to do this with Spring 2.5.5, you need to over-ride large chucks of code.  Specifically, during de-registration, MBeanExporter provides no pre- hook to allow you to stop/destroy the service bean, only a post- hook, by which time it's too late.  However, there is a onRegister hook which can handle the create/start part just fine, although that hook only works if you subclass MBeanExporter.  You can't do it with listeners, since the listeners only get access to the ObjectName when onRegister and onUnregister is called.  In #9060, it was decided that maintaining a map of ObjectNames to bean instances was not sufficiently compelling.  Hopefully this use case provides that justification.  So in summary, I'd like to see (a) a new pre-unregister hook added as both a protected method in MBeanExporter, as well as added to the listener framework, and (b) The map of ObjectNames to bean instances maintained by MBeanExporter, and the bean instances added to the registration hooks for both subclasses and listeners.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-06T00:16:32Z","2019-01-11T18:31:45Z"

I also have an `@InitBinder` method, which calls initDirectFieldAccess() on the WebDataBinder.  This obviously only makes sense in the context of the command-object methods, but there's no way to make that distinction in the annotation.  When invoking the methods which declare command object parameters, all is well.  However, when invoking the methods which use plain parameter arguments, the `@InitBinder` method is still called and fails on initDirectFieldAccess  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Target bean must not be null at org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Assert.java:112) at org.springframework.validation.DirectFieldBindingResult.\(DirectFieldBindingResult.java:51) at org.springframework.validation.DataBinder.initDirectFieldAccess(DataBinder.java:191)  I suggest that DataBinder be made aware that if its targetBean is null, then do not try and create the DirectFieldBindingResult, since it makes no sense in that context.

The import fails because import.xslt cannot be found.  If I then plug in my own URIResolver and make it log the href and base arguments, the base has actually resolved as file:///D:/WEB-INF.  I'd expect the base to be the webapp's WEB-INF directory on disk.  This is probably because when Spring wraps my transform.xslt in a StreamSource (via ServletContextResource) and passes that Source to the TransformerFactory, it loses all context information and doesn't know the base URi of the stylesheet.

If the response parameter is not declared, then Spring will attempt to generate a ModelAndView.  The docs should state this explicitly.

Looking at the code, it would seem that nothing in that class hierarchy is calling setExceptionListener() on the Connection object.  If this was done, then the listener container would be notified (in theory) by the JMS container when the connection was dead, and could then re-initialise the shared connection.  In environments when the JMS connection is frequently  dropped(e.g. JBossMQ in a cluster), this makes the SimpleMessageListenerContainer not useful, which is a shame, since otherwise it is just what I need.  I'd prefer to use it over the DefaultMessageListenerConatiner due to its simplicitly.  When an ExceptionListener is not attached to the Connection in JBossMQ, and the connection fails, then JBossMQ will log constant errors to the console saying ""Connection failure, use setExceptionLustener() to handle this error and reconnect"".

The bean would read the XML mapping file, then the annotated mappings, and ""blend"" them.  However, due to the change in 2.5.1 to LocalSessionFactoryBean (see #7275), the XML mappings are eagerly compiled before the code in AnnotationSessionFactoryBean gets a look in, and because the XML mapping refers to annotation-mapped classes, this fails.  I was sure that this way of specifying mappings was valid and legal according to the documentation, but I can't seem to find the reference anywhere.

I bring this up because I've just had a rather frustrating few hours trying to figure out why I was calling a method on a scoped-proxy bean, and all I was getting was an empty, unitinitialized proxy object.

I do like and desire context separation (web vs. service), but I would prefer the separation to be driven within Spring itself within the master configuration, rather than manually in web.xml.  I realize the above feature is most likely a Spring 3.0 feature, but I do think there are some things we can do in Spring 2.5.  Simply relaxing the requirement that a dispatcher-servlet always have a configuration file would go along way to getting the configuration design model I'd like to see from the user's perspective, even if everything gets put in one context in reality.  Currently, to get what I want I have to define a dummy dispatcher-config file with no beans and point to it.  I think the benefit gained in centralized configuration outweighs the current limitation that this can only be achieved with one ApplicationContext.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.3","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-04-23T22:43:22Z","2015-09-22T17:34:34Z"

I've been a couple of days searching if this particular issue has been addressed, but I haven't found anything. However, if I'm mistaken, my apologies O:-)  Well, to the point: AFAIK, there are a few ways to inject beans into a servlet, as noted in here: http://andykayley.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-to-inject-spring-beans-into.html  It would be nice to have automatic DI inside a servlet (incidentally, is this a design issue? why?), so beans could get automatically injected instead of retrieving them via ServletContext. I've made a little servlet which achieves automatic DI, by name or by type, both fields and methods. The idea is that developers' should extend DependencyInjectionServlet to get DI in their fields (and/or methods). Default behaviour of the attached servlet is to inject spring beans in all fields (except serialVersionUID and log) and doesn't try to inject in methods. That seemed most intuitive option to me. Also, autowiring, by default, is made by name.  However, this behaviour can be altered by overriding corresponding methods.  The idea of automatic DI inside the servlet came to me when digging into Stripes source code, which was adapted to make the DI inside the servlet. (Stripes behaviour is to inject beans into `@SpringBean` fields and methods).  the zip also contains a very dumb webapp which tests the servlet.  regards, jp   ---  **Attachments:** - [spring-servlet-dependency-injection.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14186/spring-servlet-dependency-injection.zip) (_23.70 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-06-16T20:09:06Z","2012-06-19T09:36:32Z"

An alert is exactly the same like a Validation Error, but give the oportunity to the user to resubmit again ignoring them. I have implemented outside of spring in a subclass of SimpleFormController this functionally and it´s not too complicated, but it seems that will be easier. This controller just insert with an special tag the fields wicth have alerts, and in the second submit doesn´t check again that fields, and when finally there are no alerts the submit in complete. In previous experience with users, it´s so useful to give alerts about some diferent conditions, like for example if a new field has the same name that other existing in the database but has change the case of some letters. That could be correct or not, depending of the situation, and you need database access, javascript is not useful in that case.

There is a regression with spring 2.0.x. In my bean, I declare : public class MyDao { `@PersistenceContext` private HibernateEntityManager     entityManager; ... }  I am then adding the necessary property in the config file so that spring generates a proxy that implements HibernateEntityManager that provided the ""getSession()"" method giving access to criteria:  \ \ \ \ \ \  But when the bean is instantiated, the property won't be set because spring ensures the property on which the annotation `@PersistenceContext` is set is exactely of the type ""EntityManager.class"" and doesn't allow an inherited type (this is done in PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor line 527) A work-around I found is to proceed like this :  public class MyDao { private HibernateEntityManager       em; // No annotation here  `@PersistenceContext` public void setEntityManager(EntityManager em) { this.em = (HibernateEntityManager) em; } ... }  But this would be simpler to allow inherited type and to check is the proxy implements the required type.

I even demo-ed this at SpringOne in 2007 (see http://blog.springsource.com/main/2007/06/25/code-samples-from-springone-beyond-the-obvious-talk/ for details).  Currently, this requires one to override the createWebApplicationContext method, copy its content and change the call on line 253 to do something else. This is the line: wac.setConfigLocation(servletContext.getInitParameter(CONFIG_LOCATION_PARAM));  Instead of directly calling servletContext.getInitParameter, I suggest to factor this out into a protected method so custom subclasses can easily change the way they choose to determine what config locations to use. That would prevent having to copy the entire method to just change a single line.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-14T00:17:50Z","2008-07-18T03:15:56Z"

In line with Java EE 5, it might be nice to support at least DI of fields and setters annotated with `@Resource`. Probably `@Autowired` makes sense as well: the reason I'm not sure is that #6727 clearly indicates that ServletWrappingController is not supposed to offer real DI capabilities, but that SimpleServletHandlerAdapter should be used for those cases.

As a result, the hot deploy times increased drastically. The application was otherwise unmodified , so we're definitely not using any specific 2.5.5 features (i.e. component-scanning)  Here are some timings from my local machine (win xp), the application is deployed as an unpacked WAR in Weblogic's autodeploy directory.  I hotdeployed the app 5 times in sequence, without making any request to the application in between.  Timings are taken from the ""Root WebApplicationContext: initialization completed in X ms"" message. The server was restarted and WLS jar caches were cleared in between runs.  2.0.8 (ms)         6562                  6000                  5969                  6844                  6894  2.5.5 (ms) 27203 28532 32141 34345 32562  There is an almost 500% increase in deploy time. Also, I noticed that the 2.5.5 deployment time seems to increase with the number of times deployed (it went as high as 38s).  http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?p=188252 seems to indicate something similar, but he's using component-scanning.

As it is not part of any official specification I'm not sure if people are willing to support this very vendor specific extension at all, but then again, patterns requiring support for long lived http-connections might become more and more popular as everyone is buzzing of Ajax.  Apache Tomcat 6.0 when ran using APR support (native libraries) or Http11NioProtocol test if any of the defined servlets implement the interface CometProcessor [1] and if they do their event(CometEvent) will be used in favor of the normal servlet api's service(ServletRequest, ServletResponse). More information on the AIO features of tomcat 6 can be found at [2].  So what I thought to suggest is creating CometProcessor version of DispatcherServlet, perhaps even a subclass of it to be used as a baseclass for all ""vendor-specific"" apis there are (until a standard is produced). This would be necessary (instead of simply implementing CometProcessor in DispatcherServlet) as implementing the CometProcessor interface disables the normal Servlet methods.  Any ideas? Or has this already been implemented? :)  [1] http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/CometProcessor.html [2] http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/aio.html  ---  **Issue Links:** - #10258 Support Servlet 3.0 (JSR-315)  5 votes, 5 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-09-17T22:34:04Z","2019-01-11T15:40:20Z"

Here is the exception:  java.lang.SecurityException: [Security:090398]Invalid Subject: principals=[eventfetcher] at weblogic.rjvm.ResponseImpl.unmarshalReturn(ResponseImpl.java:195) at weblogic.rmi.cluster.ClusterableRemoteRef.invoke(ClusterableRemoteRef.java:338) at weblogic.rmi.cluster.ClusterableRemoteRef.invoke(ClusterableRemoteRef.java:252) at weblogic.jndi.internal.ServerNamingNode_921_WLStub.lookup(Unknown Source) at weblogic.jndi.internal.WLContextImpl.lookup(WLContextImpl.java:374) at weblogic.jndi.internal.WLContextImpl.lookup(WLContextImpl.java:362) at weblogic.rmi.cluster.BasicReplicaHandler.refreshReplicaList(BasicReplicaHandler.java:506) at weblogic.rmi.cluster.BasicReplicaHandler.failOver(BasicReplicaHandler.java:206) at weblogic.rmi.cluster.ClusterableRemoteRef.invoke(ClusterableRemoteRef.java:257) at weblogic.jms.frontend.FEConnectionFactoryImpl_922_WLStub.connectionCreateRequest(Unknown Source) at weblogic.jms.client.JMSConnectionFactory.setupJMSConnection(JMSConnectionFactory.java:238) at weblogic.jms.client.JMSConnectionFactory.createConnectionInternal(JMSConnectionFactory.java:299) at weblogic.jms.client.JMSConnectionFactory.createConnection(JMSConnectionFactory.java:205) at org.springframework.jms.support.JmsAccessor.createConnection(JmsAccessor.java:184) at org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractJmsListeningContainer.createSharedConnection(AbstractJmsListeningContaine r.java:401) at com.db.websso.jms.WeblogicMessageListenerContainer.createSharedConnection(WeblogicMessageListenerContainer.java:41 ) at org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractJmsListeningContainer.refreshSharedConnection(AbstractJmsListeningContain er.java:386) at org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer.refreshConnectionUntilSuccessful(DefaultMessageLi stenerContainer.java:782) at org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer.recoverAfterListenerSetupFailure(DefaultMessageLi stenerContainer.java:764) at org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer$AsyncMessageListenerInvoker.run(DefaultMessageLis tenerContainer.java:892)  I had implemented a hack to partly solve the problem by extending the listener, but it's not completely effective. The result is that some threads seem to recover, while others continue to fail (and I can not currently explain why, given my hack re-creates the JNDI in the current thread!). Here's the hack:  protected Connection createSharedConnection() throws JMSException { // Associate JNDI variables (user and password) with this thread for the benefit // of the WL drivers. try { InitialContext ic = new InitialContext(jndiTemplate.getEnvironment()); } catch (NamingException e) { logger.warn(e.getMessage()); }       return super.createSharedConnection(); }  It's not very nice and it would be better to find a long term decent solution to this problem. Until a solution is in place, this object (and other JMS functionality, such as multiple threads and the JmsTemplate) will fail to work correctly with Weblogic.  I'm happy to test possible solutions if someone with indepth experience of the Spring JMS code can put forward suggestions.

"","9637","FreeMarkerView should support AllHttpScopesHashModel (analogous to FreeMarkerServlet in FreeMarker 2.3.14) [SPR-4962]","**[John Arkley](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=exappl088)** opened **[SPR-4962](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4962?redirect=false)** and commented  During development of my 1st web-app i found this because i began using appfuse-light-spring-freemarker-ibatis-1.8.1 as my prototype application.  appfuseLt uses Sitemesh  (opensymphony.org) to decorate Freemarker generated pages, by implementing a Servlet filter that diverts the FreemarkerView generated response into a buffer, parses that buffer and then inserts the generated view content as strings variables (${head} ${title}, ${body} ,,,) into the root data model and then invokes aSitemesh sub-class of FreemarkerServlet to generate the decorated page into the HttpResponse,  i.e. It a 1 level ""Tiles like"" compositiing implementation that allows a decorator.flt file to insert the $(body) of a view into a multi-column page layout.  The FreeMarkerServlet wraps the data-model as the AllHttpScopesHashModel, with its not found fall-through lookup in 4 scopes, (like jsp ?), page, Request, Session, and Application (servlet context), which the FreeMarkerView does not.  Although FreeMarkerView does insert the same set of scopes, because it is not using the AllHttpScopesHashModel to wrap them, code that works in the decorator.flt file that references a variable with ${message}, must be coded as ${Request.message} or ${Session.message} to be referenced in a Freemarker template processed by springs FreeMarkerView.  I tripped over this when i moved a small fragment  Freemarker markup from a decorator template to a view template.  I ""enhanced""   FreeMarkerView.java by cloning a method (createModel)  from FreeMarkerServlet.java and added an inner class clone of Freemarkers AllHttpScopesHashModel.java (see src below)  This latter choice was to make hacking up spring-webmvc.jar as fast a possible, and due to the constructor for AllHttpScopesHashModel not being declared public; which i suspect was just a oversight by the Freemarker coder(s), because all the other xxxxHashModel classes have public constructors.  This change also made it necessary to change the signature of FreeMarkerView's method as show here with the Map replaced with TemplateModel, so applying this patch with break anyone who has overridden FreeMarkerView.processTemplate(); protected void processTemplate(Template template, TemplateModel model, HttpServletResponse response)  I think Freemarker should make the constructor public so you could implement this fix without using an inner class, which i suspect has implications i don't grasp, as i am not a java expert.  I have only tested my  3 views plus 2 form views on this hack, but variable lookup works the same in FreemarkerView as in the FreemarkerServlet.  I have not got the springframework tests running yet, so i built my -webmvc.jar wtih ant by hand after recompling just the one file, FreeMarkerView.java, overwriting the un-jar'ed spring-webmvc.jar class files.  Anyone just using FreeMarkerViews for view rendering, but not using the FreeMarkerServlet (due to Sitemesh in my case) will not see this issue.  my hacked version of FreeMarkerView.java  ---  /* * Copyright 2002-2007 the original author or authors.  *   * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License"");  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.  * You may obtain a copy of the License at  *   *         http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0  *   * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software  * distributed under the License is distributed on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and  * limitations under the License.   */  package org.springframework.web.servlet.view.freemarker;  import java.io.IOException; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Enumeration; import java.util.Locale; import java.util.Map; import java.util.HashMap;  import javax.servlet.GenericServlet; import javax.servlet.ServletConfig; import javax.servlet.ServletContext; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.ServletRequest; import javax.servlet.ServletResponse; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;  import freemarker.core.ParseException; import freemarker.ext.jsp.TaglibFactory; import freemarker.ext.servlet.FreemarkerServlet; import freemarker.ext.servlet.HttpRequestHashModel; import freemarker.ext.servlet.HttpRequestParametersHashModel; import freemarker.ext.servlet.HttpSessionHashModel; import freemarker.ext.servlet.ServletContextHashModel; import freemarker.template.Configuration; import freemarker.template.ObjectWrapper; import freemarker.template.Template; import freemarker.template.TemplateModel; import freemarker.template.TemplateModelException; import freemarker.template.TemplateException; import freemarker.template.SimpleHash;  import org.springframework.beans.BeansException; import org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactoryUtils; import org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanInitializationException; import org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException; import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException; import org.springframework.web.servlet.support.RequestContextUtils; import org.springframework.web.servlet.view.AbstractTemplateView;  /** * View using the FreeMarker template engine.  *   *   \Exposes the following JavaBean properties: *  \ *  \\url\: the location of the FreeMarker template to be wrapped, * relative to the FreeMarker template context (directory).  *   \\encoding\ (optional, default is determined by FreeMarker configuration): * the encoding of the FreeMarker template file  *   \ *  *   \Depends on a single {`@link` FreeMarkerConfig} object such as {`@link` FreeMarkerConfigurer} * being accessible in the current web application context, with any bean name.  * Alternatively, you can set the FreeMarker {`@link` Configuration} object as bean property.  * See {`@link` #setConfiguration} for more details on the impacts of this approach.  *   *   \Note: Spring's FreeMarker support requires FreeMarker 2.3 or higher. *  * `@author` Darren Davison  * `@author` Juergen Hoeller  * `@since` 03.03.2004  * `@see` #setUrl  * `@see` #setExposeSpringMacroHelpers  * `@see` #setEncoding  * `@see` #setConfiguration  * `@see` FreeMarkerConfig  * `@see` FreeMarkerConfigurer   */   public class FreeMarkerView extends AbstractTemplateView {    private String encoding;    private Configuration configuration;    private TaglibFactory taglibFactory;    private ServletContextHashModel servletContextHashModel;    /** ________________________________________________________________________________________    * Set the encoding of the FreeMarker template file.

When the first transaction completes this synchronization runs and the shared connection is closed (there is no proxy or smart connection pattern used as in JDBC). Subsequent use of the now closed connection fail with IllegalStateException (as per JMS spec).  The bug appears to be in the ResourceFactory passed from DMLC to CFUtils. This implements createConnection() by returning a reference to the shared connection, however CFUtils is expecting a fresh connection that is can close (or at least one that suppresses close).  Using higher levels of caching avoids this issue since the DMLC never calls into CFUtils, it just uses the pre-established shared session.  We also notice that using a JmsTransactionManager causes the shared connection to be ignored, since a new connection is created and bound for each transaction.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-29T03:54:36Z","2012-06-19T03:46:54Z"

We have a situation where we have set our context to lazily init all beans by default.  Since the CustomEditorConfigurer is a BeanFactoryPostProcessor, it is instantiated and the postProcessBeanFactory method is invoked despite being lazily initialized.  This would typically not be an issue, except that some of the classes we are registering PropertyEditor's for are not actually included in our classpath.  This is by design - we want to have one single context configuration (consisting of many related context files) being consumed by many different clients.  By setting the beans to lazily init, the client can choose which dependent jars it needs, based on what functionality it requires.  In this particular case, one client does not need any of the functionality related to classes which are set up in the CustomEditorConfigurer, but it is forced to include them in order to successfully load the context.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.2  **Attachments:** - [spring-2.5.2-custompropertyeditor.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13757/spring-2.5.2-custompropertyeditor.patch) (_4.52 kB_) - [spring-2.5.2-custompropertyeditor.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13756/spring-2.5.2-custompropertyeditor.patch) (_3.56 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-10T05:18:23Z","2012-06-19T03:46:55Z"

Now, If we want save all the instance within the Collection, We have to implements the SaveAll method by myself in my DAO classes.               public void saveAll(Collection entities) {           for (Iterator it = entities.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {              getHibernateTemplate().save(it.next());           }       }             Actually the performance of above method is very bad. Here is a sample test result.               Inserting 4239 rows spends 10078 Millseconds              Inserting 4240 rows spends 8953 Millseconds            If we do not use the HibernateTemplate and use Session.save() method for each elements in Collection.         Here is Test result:              Inserting 4239 rows spends 1437 Millseconds              Inserting 4240 rows spends 1031 Millseconds                 If we importing two new method into class HibernateTemplate as following:            public void saveAll(final Collection entities) throws DataAccessException {           execute(new HibernateCallback() {               public Object doInHibernate(Session session) throws HibernateException {               checkWriteOperationAllowed(session);                for (Iterator it = entities.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {                   session.save(it.next());                }               return null;            }           }, true);        }  public void updateAll(final Collection entities) throws DataAccessException { execute(new HibernateCallback() { public Object doInHibernate(Session session) throws HibernateException { checkWriteOperationAllowed(session); for (Iterator it = entities.iterator(); it.hasNext();) { session.update(it.next()); } return null; } }, true); }  The above two method could improve the update and save operation performance significantly. Here is the test result. Inserting 4239 rows spends 1343 Millseconds Inserting 4240 rows spends 547 Millseconds  The reason of performance improving is the new method reduce the execution times of method checkWriteOperationAllowed(session) and creation times of HibernateCallback object.

We want for some method or body of for cyklus to be executed in another session (and then close it). If hibernate data  exception is thrown it will be safe to catch this exception and continue data access with origin session.

"","9271","easier framework support for the creation & injection of a bean by its class [SPR-4594]","**[James Strachan](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jstrachan)** opened **[SPR-4594](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4594?redirect=false)** and commented  Now that a bean can be annotated with `@Service` / `@Component` its no longer required to be inside an ApplicationContext for Spring to be able to instantiate and inject it. Yet from the public Spring context API the only choice you've got is to access beans by name. (Unless I've missed something :)  There are numerous frameworks out there that want to create an instance of some type easily (without it necessarily being in the spring.xml). Off the top of my head here's a few I've seen some icky code to integrate spring injection but am sure there's loads more...  * struts * stripes * jersey * apache came  Now in Guice its super easy. You do things like  ``` MyStartClass starter = injector.getInstance(MyStartClass.class); ```  You're done; all the nice IoC is done by the injector which is a framework developers dream.  When using Spring now we've got 2.5.x its kinda hacky.  e.g. here's some code from trying to use Spring nicely inside JAX-RS (Jersey). Notice its trying to find bean names; then if not it tries to use the BeanFactory in the appContext. This doesn't deal with things like the `@Component` / `@Service` use case though.  ```  import java.lang.reflect.Constructor; import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;  import com.sun.ws.rest.spi.service.ComponentProvider; import org.apache.commons.logging.Log; import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory; import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.AutowireCapableBeanFactory; import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableListableBeanFactory; import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;  /**  * @version $Revision: 1.1 $  */ public class SpringComponentProvider implements ComponentProvider {     private static final transient Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(SpringComponentProvider.class);     private final ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext;     private int autowireMode = AutowireCapableBeanFactory.AUTOWIRE_AUTODETECT;     private boolean dependencyCheck;      public SpringComponentProvider(ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext) {         this.applicationContext = applicationContext;     }      public  T getInstance(Scope scope, Class type) throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException {         String name = getBeanName(type);         Object value;         if (name != null) {             if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {                 LOG.debug(""Found bean named: "" + name);             }             value = applicationContext.getBean(name, type);         }         else {             LOG.debug(""No bean name so using BeanFactory.createBean"");             value = applicationContext.getBeanFactory().createBean(type, autowireMode, dependencyCheck);         }         return type.cast(value);     }      protected  String getBeanName(Class type) {         String[] names = applicationContext.getBeanNamesForType(type);         String name = null;         if (names.length == 1) {             name = names[0];         }         return name;     }      public  T getInstance(Scope scope, Constructor constructor, Object[] objects) throws InstantiationException, IllegalArgumentException, IllegalAccessException, InvocationTargetException {         return constructor.newInstance(objects);     }      public void inject(Object object) {         String beanName = getBeanName(object.getClass());         if (beanName != null) {             ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory = applicationContext.getBeanFactory();             beanFactory.configureBean(object, beanName);         }     }      // Properties     //-------------------------------------------------------------------------     public int getAutowireMode() {         return autowireMode;     }      public void setAutowireMode(int autowireMode) {         this.autowireMode = autowireMode;     }      public boolean isDependencyCheck() {         return dependencyCheck;     }      public void setDependencyCheck(boolean dependencyCheck) {         this.dependencyCheck = dependencyCheck;     } } ```  Now maybe SpringSource are now thinking, to hell with frameworks just use the Spring porfolio for everything bwaahahhahaha.  However one of the big factors for Spring's success has always been that it works nicely with loads of different frameworks (struts v stripes v tapestry et al). So I'm wondering would you consider writing some kind of SpringInjector helper class?  So a framework could do something like...  ``` Injector injector = new Injector(applicationContext); MyStartClass starter = injector.getInstance(MyStartClass.class); ```  This could then do things like; look for a single instance of MyStartClass in the bean names and use that if specified (fail if there's more than one); or if not treat it as a kinda `@Component`/`@Service` type and call its constructors and any other `@Autowired` / `@Resource` injection points etc.  i.e. now that there's the mixed model of stuff by name in the app context and stuff on the classpath which are types; could we have a simple unified injector API please for us poor hackers who sometimes dare to work with a framework which is not currently developed by SpringSource? :). Or - could Spring please catch up with Guice in the ease of use stakes as being an IoC framework? :)  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.2  **Issue Links:** - #18353 Programmatic bean registration within configuration classes  4 votes, 3 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-17T22:50:42Z","2019-01-11T17:18:39Z"

Symptoms are that lots of beans annotated with `@Component` are being skipped for inclusion as beans. After digging through the code, I think the following commit is the culprit:  http://fisheye1.cenqua.com/changelog/springframework?cs=MAIN:jhoeller:20080107164524  The commit message says:  added ""getEnclosingClassName()"", ""hasEnclosingClass()"" and ""isIndependent()"" methods to ClassMetadata interface; ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider (""context:component-scan"") ignores non-static inner and local classes  I am not sure why beanDefinition.getMetadata().isIndependent() is returning false for my classes. The scenario is as follows:  MyBroker has `@Component` annotation. MyBroker uses a class MyService (regular instantiation) using something like: MyService service = new MyService() MyService, in turn, is the class which DOES have a local inner class. I think the bug is in identifying MyBroker as having an inner class. It should not identify MyBroker as having an inner class (since it doesn't have one).  ClassMetaDataReadingVisitor.java has the following method:      public boolean isIndependent() {     	return (this.enclosingClassName == null || this.independentInnerClass);     }  In that method, while trying to see if MyBroker is a candidate, enclosingClassName is set to MyService.

"","9787","Add ability to declare bean type and explicitely mark bean factories in XML configurations [SPR-5114]","**[Grzegorz Borkowski](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=grzegorzborkowski)** opened **[SPR-5114](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-5114?redirect=false)** and commented  This is the description of my proposition for two small improvements of Spring XML configuration files in defaults schema (""beans"").  Description of the problem:  Let us first look at a fragment of typical configuration, here configuring JPA:  \ \ \ \ \ ... \  In Spring documentation and presentations it is often mentioned, that explicit configuration in XML has advantage of being kind of blueprint documentation of the application. So what we can find out reading this fragment? First, we have a bean of type LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean. Suppose I want to inject reference to it in other bean. What type this reference should be? If I check quickly in JavaDoc, I will find out that it extends AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean. I suppose that it implements JPA's EntityManagerFactory. But it doesn't. So I'm confused here. After more reading, I will find finally that it implements FactoryBean and returns EntityManagarFactory bean. But is is not visible at all from the configuration. I believe it should. Then I look at dataSource bean. It is of type org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource. I want to inject it into my other bean. What should be type of injected field: BasicDataSource? I would say, in 90% of cases not, it should be standard jdbc DataSource. In most cases BasicDataSource configured by Spring no longer needs programatic access to its specific methods. But can I make my field  being of type BasicDataSource? Yes I can. Is it good way? Definitely not. It is not a good way, because if after some time somebody decides to put our application on some JDNI-aware server and retrieve dataSource bean from JNDI, than application will suddenly crash, because one of programmers (or more) declared injected filed as BasicDataSource instead of DataSource. But how on earth could he know? He saw bean of ""BasicDataSource"" in spring XML.  Solution: Solution consist of two improvements. Both of them must not be obligatory, because of backword compatibility. They introduce (almost) no behavioral changes, no logic etc. They purpose is purely to improve the XML configuration semantics, i.e. making XML more clear in the role of application blueprint.  1. If the bean implements BeanFactory interface, you can declare it as \ instead of \ (you can, don't have to). This has advantage that it is immediatelly visible looking into config file, that the returned bean will be not of the type of ""class"" attribute and cannot be cast to any of it supertypes. You must check instead what type this factory returns.  2. Add additional optional attribute ""type"" (or maybe ""castType"" or ""castTo"" or ...?) is added to \ and \. This is a hint for other developers that they should in most cases cast the bean to this type. If they do, then you can safely replace implementations of this type at any time, and you will not get any nasty problems with incompatible types at runtime.  Let's rewrite our example now:  \ \ \ \ \ ... \  Now I don't have to searching JavaDocs to find out what is this LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean. I immediately see, that is is factoryBean, which returns EntityManagerFactory. And I am less afraid that one of programmers from my team declares injected dataSource bean somewhere in the code as BasicDataSource, becaue now everybody knows that the dataSource bean should be always referred to as javax.sql.DataSource. (Obviously the problem can still happen, sometimes you can really need some methods of BasicDataSource in your code. But now at least you were warned by the ""type"" attribute that you are doing it on you own risk and on your responsibility, so you must really have a good reason to do it.). This clearly states the intent of the person who put this declarations: ""I declare the bean emf of type EntityManagerFactory, implemented by LocalContaierEntityManagerFactoryBean factory. I declare dataSource bean of DataSource type, implemented by BasicDataSource. So there are really two beans here: EntityManagerFactory and DataSource"". You cannot say it looking at original configuration fragment.  This is almost purely semantical change. Almost, because we can add small change to Spring behavior: 1. If bean is declared as \ Spring will check if it implements BeanFactory (or we can decide that having such XML element it is no longer necessary to implement this interface); 2. If ""type"" attribute is declared, Spring will check if returned bean can be really casted to this type, and throw exception otherwise.

Details:  ---  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \                                                                                   ---  The JMS ConnectionFactory looked up under java:/JmsXA is XA-capable.  What i want is an XA transaction to be begun through JBoss' transactionManager, the JMS message receive performed within that XA transaction and then the onMessage() of the MDP executed in that same transaction. The above snipped works correctly as expected. However, this only works if JtaTransactionManager.transactionSynchronizationName is explicitly turned off (to SYNCHRONIZATION_NEVER in the above example). Without turning off transactionSynchronization on the JtaTransactionManager, the JMS Connection does not seem to be enrolled in the XA transaction.  Proof:  we performed several tests that for us indicate clearly that JMS message receipt is not performed in the scope of the XA transaction in which onMessage() executes. However, this is hard to report here.  as an indication, however, the following log output may suffice. With the above configuration (which works) the log output is  ---  [listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer: Received message of type [class org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsObjectMessage] from consumer [org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsMessageConsumer@14ecfa4] of session [org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsSession@185ded7]  ---  when transactionSynchronizationName is not set on JtaTransactionManager (and hence transactionSynchronization is on) the log output would be  ---  [listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer: Received message of type [class org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsObjectMessage] from consumer [org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsMessageConsumer@14ecfa4] of transactional session [org.jboss.resource.adapter.jms.JmsSession@185ded7]  ---  This may indicate that a JMS-local transaction (rather than a JTA transaction) is used in the later case?  Now: the above configuration which explicitly turns of transactionSynchronization works but neither is it comprehensible to me why i would need to turn off transactionSynchronization nor do i understand what difference it makes for this usage nor is it documented anywhere that to use DefaultMessageListenerContainer with XA transactions you must turn off transactionSynchronization.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","in: data,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-12T23:02:06Z","2019-01-13T22:40:54Z"

In that case, the object is now associated with a new session and getSession() will return another user's session to the background thread.  Basically, the getSession method should check first if the ServletRequestAttributes.session attribute is not null... if it is not null, use it!

I am migrating an application which worked fine in Tomcat but fails under glassfish.  When the action=""blah"" attribute of a form is generated by  tags, instead of providing the correct url e.g blah.htm?projectid=6,  under gassfish the action is pointing to the jsp which is rendering the view. This means on form submission the content is sent to the view, cutting out the controller and generally fails as you would expect.

Once tomcat's StandardHostValue has invoked the servlet chain checks the request for the existence of ""javax.servlet.error.exception"" and if it's present it throws the response away and starts error page processing.  The net result is that views resolved by an ExceptionResolver running in tomcat will never actually be seen.

After this conclusion and some debbuging, the problem was narrowed down to MessageInvoker.findMatchingMethod().  In this situation, the numberOfMatchingMethods will be equal to 2 (the two methods above) and because of this it cannot choose the correct method and retruns null (code down), discarting the request making it not arriving at the MDP defined.  // Only return matching method if exactly one found. if (numberOfMatchingMethods == 1) { return matchingMethod; } else { return null; }  I believe that should not be the case, and it should be capable of detecting the super class of the request and consider the SECOND method has the one to receive the request.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final  **Issue Links:** - #7067 MessageListenerAdapter should invoke closest matching method based on parameter type","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-06T22:30:05Z","2019-01-11T16:59:54Z"

[x] Introduce before/after test execution callbacks in the `TestExecutionListener` API. 2. [x] Introduce before/after test execution callbacks in `TestContextManager`. 3. [x] Introduce before/after test execution support in the `SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`. 4. [x] Introduce before/after test execution support in the `SpringExtension` for JUnit 5. 5. [x] Introduce before/after test execution support in `AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests`. 6. [x] Document that before/after test execution callbacks cannot be supported with JUnit 4 Rules. 7. [x] Introduce appropriate integration tests for the `SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`, the `SpringExtension`, and `AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests`.  ---  #### Comments from Original Poster  > Unitils is an open source testing project, offering features such as integration with dbunit, test database maintenance and support for mock objects. > The core of Unitils works in a similar fashion as the spring testcontext framework, with a testlistener that provides callbacks during the execution of tests. It's also been implemented for Junit 3.8, Junit 4 and TestNG. >  > An adaptor could be written that translates spring's listener calls into unitils listener calls. Such an adaptor could be easily implemented as an org.springframework.test.context.TestExecutionListener. However, unitils' listener system currently offers more hooks than spring's. Therefore we'd like to see spring's framework extended to add callbacks directly before and directly after executing the test method (after executing the `@Before` and before executing the `@After` methods).  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1  **Attachments:** - [springTestcontextUnitilsIntegration.txt](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13304/springTestcontextUnitilsIntegration.txt) (_38.38 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #18151 Introduce support for JUnit 5 in the TestContext framework (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #11259 Introduce a TestExecutionListener for DbUnit - #8640 Please allow TestExecutionListeners to fail the test  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/087efa668c42eeb9cc2ea79a17853a415d66d2c7, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/833deadddc0de6ea791f58e561d39e920b3e013d, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/f7f37cdb1b3d57f49cd014e2cda6d64779260b8d, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/6efb166c3628391360af81f226600348ab985007, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/80018c67e758d19bf50433edbcb14cf7e98b1eaf, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/fd008405a1f9bd1fef755d7e0aa5bb48895f0c73, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/3da5fbe995f971f1ac0c13f108a9d6c8325dfe11, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/da893328407766d95cbaddf0ce99fcdfeb202bae, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/5302566cbb71a0d1354bb55b7addf1a4fa965981  3 votes, 4 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-21T08:04:01Z","2019-01-13T08:05:48Z"

Let me give an example to illustrate what I mean.  Suppose we have a scheduled job that runs on a given date at a given time. To do this, we need to know the execution date, as well as the hour of day to execute on. We want to separate these two items out and do not wish to wrap our ""hour"" value into a Date object (whatever the reason may be). From the administrative point, we are also able to change these hour and date values individually. However, when we set up a new job time, we must ensure that the time is not in the past. This can happen due to two reasons: 1) The date is a past date 2) The date is today's date but the hour has already passed.  Say in our form we want to highlight both of these fields as error fields (since the entire date/hr combination is a problem, not just a single attribute). However, if we reject both of the fields as error fields, it theoretically represents 2 errors. Although, what we really want is to represent one error caused by the combination of two fields.  Here's another example:  Suppose we have a budget management application so we can allocate our weekly expenses. We now have to decide how to split our budget between 3 categories - food, living and entertainment. In our WeeklyBudget validator, combined together, these 3 categories cannot cost us more than our budget for the week. Once again, there is really just one error, but we have to reject 3 fields (create 3 errors).  So I guess my question is, is there a way to mark multiple fields as error fields for a singe error? If not, I know I can work around it, but can it be built into the framework?

This patch address both issues.  Async invocation is used automatically where the invoked method has void return type and no declared Exceptions. I simply set the replyTo queue to null and properly handle that through the invocation. Obviously I do not wait for any reply in the control flow.

However one of the things I love about Spring is it allows me to write code thats REALLY easy to unit test and adding an HttpServletRequest ruins that.  Simply by noticing that there are '*' in the url, it should be possible to have a class such as RequestParts (or even a string array), that tells me that the 1st part is ""welcome-to-the-site"".  In this manner, the signature could be:  public String showPost(Map map, RequestParts rp) { if (rp.hasParts()) { // Load up rp.getPart(0); } else { // Show an archive page } }  This would obviously work very well with a String array but might be ambiguous from `@RequestParam`, which is why a simple class could handle this.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final  4 votes, 0 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-11T11:31:04Z","2012-06-19T09:36:24Z"

It prevent's us from bringing our application into production.  I have one EAR with an ejb-jar module and a war module. - The ejb-jar module contains my stateless session beans and my MDBs. - The SLSBs and the MDBs extend from Spring's EJB convenience classes.  I'm using the shared context approach in which the spring context is shared between the ejb's (mdbs and slsbs) and the web module. All my ejb's therefore exhibit the following code pattern: \ public void setMessageDrivenContext(MessageDrivenContext messageDrivenContext) { super.setMessageDrivenContext(messageDrivenContext); setBeanFactoryLocator(ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator.getInstance(""classpath*:**/beanRefContext.xml"")); setBeanFactoryLocatorKey(""service""); } \  My web.xml contains the following entries: \ \ \contextConfigLocation\ \/WEB-INF/config/spring/spring-presentation.xml\ \               locatorFactorySelector         classpath*:**/beanRefContext.xml                        parentContextKey         service                        org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener       \  The beanRefContext.xml file is located in my application server's domain lib/classes directory so it's ""accessible"" by both modules.  This setup works perfectly as long as there are no messages on the queue when deploying/starting the application (in SJAS terms, the domain). In this ""no messages"" scenario the ejb module is deployed and no calls are made by the container of setMessageDrivenContext or ejbCreate methods (this is consistent with the ejb life cycle): [#|2008-01-05T12:45:45.366+0100|INFO|sun-appserver-ee8.1_02|javax.enterprise.system.core.classloading|_ThreadID=10;|LDR5010: All ejb(s) of [webedison] loaded successfully!|#]  After the ejb's have been loaded the web module is being loaded: [#|2008-01-05T12:45:45.406+0100|INFO|sun-appserver-ee8.1_02|javax.enterprise.system.container.web|_ThreadID=10;|WEB0100: Loading web module [webedison:webedison.war] in virtual server [server] at [/edison]|#]  Then the servlet engine is started and one of the first things that occurs is the initialization of the spring root web application context. As you can see (see NO MESSAGE EXCERPT snippets at the end of this bug description) spring's start looking for a beanRefContext.xml file in different locations (classpath locations I guess) and finally the one found in my application server application domain/lib/classes is used as indicated by this log entry: [#|2008-01-05T12:45:51.755+0100|INFO|sun-appserver-ee8.1_02|javax.enterprise.system.stream.out|_ThreadID=10;|2008-01-05 12:45:51,755 [INFO ] org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionReader - Loading XML bean definitions from file [C:\dev\apps\sun\appserver\81EEQ2\domains\webedison\lib\classes\beanRefContext.xml]  Once found, spring starts processing the beanRefContext.xml loading the ""service"" bean that contains the filenames of the actual application contexts that are to be loaded (see NO MESSAGE snippet at the end of this description).

That is, as long as the container doesn't preload one or more of the ejb's before the web module is loaded and started then everythings goes fine.  However the above setup does not work if  there is a message on the queue when starting(deploying) the application (in SJAS terms, the domain).

The bug (?) that should be solved therefore I guess is how we can initialize the context from within an ejb when it's not initialized yet ""by"" the web module and how the web module is able to detect that it's already initialized or being initialized (by the ejb module) ?

"","9309","Load dedicated child ApplicationContext for test instance in the TestContext framework [SPR-4632]","**[Eberhard Wolff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=eberhardwolff)** opened **[SPR-4632](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4632?redirect=false)** and commented  #### Status Quo  The `loadContext(\*\)` methods in `AbstractGenericContextLoader` and `AbstractGenericWebContextLoader` invoke `AnnotationConfigUtils.registerAnnotationConfigProcessors(context)`.  The result is that `@Autowired`, `@Resource`, `@Inject`, etc. all work by default, even if annotation-driven dependency injection is not explicitly configured in the test's `ApplicationContext`. Consequently, if a developer is not aware of this, then errors related to the lack of explicit annotation-driven DI support in production configuration will not be noticed until after testing which is typically undesirable.  Note, however, that this unexpected behavior only applies to XML-based configuration. With JavaConfig, an `AnnotatedBeanDefinitionReader` (used internally by `AnnotationConfigContextLoader` and `AnnotationConfigWebContextLoader`) automatically registers the _annotation config processors_.  Furthermore, `BeanPostProcessors` may inadvertently be applied to the test instance -- even though the test is not truly a _bean_ in the `ApplicationContext`. This leads to potentially problematic behavior such as accidental proxying of the test instance, as described in #14113.  ---  #### Deliverables  1. [ ] As suggested in comments for this issue, create an `ApplicationContext` dedicated solely to the test instance (for the purpose of dependency injection and bean initialization) and set the `parent` of that context to the `ApplicationContext` loaded by the TCF. 2. [ ] Stop invoking `AnnotationConfigUtils.registerAnnotationConfigProcessors()` in:    - [ ] `AbstractGenericContextLoader`    - [ ] `AbstractGenericWebContextLoader` 3. [ ] Ensure that _child_ contexts are properly closed with regard to context caching in the TCF.  ---  #### Original Issue Summary  _Do not enable annotation-driven DI for the entire ApplicationContext in the TestContext framework_  #### Original Proposal  It would be better if the TestContext framework (TCF) only enabled annotation-driven dependency injection for test instances and not for the entire `ApplicationContext`.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.2  **Attachments:** - [AnnotationConfigProcessorTestExecutionListener.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14662/AnnotationConfigProcessorTestExecutionListener.java) (_1.42 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #13149 Spring Test should not modify the application context under test (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #14496 Support WebApplicationContext hierarchies in the TestContext Framework - #10284 Provide support for context hierarchies in the TestContext Framework - #18295 Support 'throw-away' context for a test class - #10719 Provide mechanism for disabling automatic annotation-driven autowiring in tests - #14113 Test instances should not be proxied in the TestContext framework  6 votes, 6 watchers","open","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-26T23:56:21Z","2019-01-15T12:06:34Z"

"","9108","HttpInvokerClientInterceptor.executeRequest method doesn't give access to original MethodInvocation when overridden. [SPR-4430]","**[Duncan Doyle](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mccloud)** opened **[SPR-4430](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4430?redirect=false)** and commented  I'm subclassing the HttpInvokerClientInterceptor (and some other remoting classes) to provide dynamic routing and dynamic timeout configuration (through some other interceptor's). I'm using the ProxyMethodInvocation's user attributes map to communicate these routing and timeout configurations in between interceptor's in the chain.  It is advised to override the executeRequest(RemoteMethodInvocation invocation) when subclassing the HttpInvokerClientInterceptor to pass a different configuration to the actual HttpInvokerRequestExecutor. However, when subclassing this method I don't have access to the original (Proxy)MethodInvocation which contains my userAttributes map, which contains my chain (request scope) configuration. I could override the interceptor's 'invoke' method but in my opinion that would be bad design.  I propose to add a second 'executeRequest' method which takes 2 parameters, the RemoteMethodInvocation and the original MethodInvocation. The default implementation just delegates the call to the 1 param executeRequest method (this solution is also provided in, for example, Spring's AstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser for the doParse methods). This way, when one subclasses the HttpInvokerClientInterceptor one can have access to the userAttributes map in the original MethodInvocation and this map can be used to create a custom HttpInvokerClientConfiguration.  The code below shows my proposed solution:  public Object invoke(MethodInvocation methodInvocation) throws Throwable { if (AopUtils.isToStringMethod(methodInvocation.getMethod())) { return ""HTTP invoker proxy for service URL ["" + getServiceUrl() + ""]""; }      	RemoteInvocation invocation = createRemoteInvocation(methodInvocation);     	RemoteInvocationResult result = null;     	try {     		result = executeRequest(invocation, methodInvocation);       //This method now calls the new 2 argument executeRequest method.     	}     	catch (Throwable ex) {     		throw convertHttpInvokerAccessException(ex);     	}     	try {     		return recreateRemoteInvocationResult(result);     	}     	catch (Throwable ex) {     		if (result.hasInvocationTargetException()) {     			throw ex;     		}     		else {     			throw new RemoteInvocationFailureException(""Invocation of method ["" + methodInvocation.getMethod() +     					""] failed in HTTP invoker remote service at ["" + getServiceUrl() + ""]"", ex);     		}     	}     }          /**      * Execute the given remote invocation via the HttpInvokerRequestExecutor.      * Can be overridden in subclasses to pass a different configuration object      * to the executor.

The BeanDefinitionBuilder however does not have (in my opinion) full support to build a GenericBeanDefinition object. Currently the only method provided to build a GenericBeanDefinition is BeanDefinitionBuilder.genericBeanDefinition(). This method however doesn't allow me to set the beanClass. As far as I can tell there is no option in the BeanDefinitionBuilder to set this classname for a GenericBeanDefinition. This results in a not fully build GenericBeanDefinition when calling the BeanDefinitionBuilder's 'getBeanDefinition()' method. I still have to call the 'setBeanClass' method on the GenericBeanDefinition itself to provide the correct Bean Class.  In my opinion, the BeanDefinitionBuilder should be able to return GenericBeanDefinition which is fully configured.  Possible solution would be to provide the methods currently available to build a RootBeanDefinition, so including 'factoryMethod', 'beanClass' and/or 'beanClassName' parameters.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-22T01:21:30Z","2012-06-19T03:46:58Z"

The most common approach is to create hacks in controller to initialize collections/arrays command object properties before binding - trim or grow collections/arrays properties to some calculated size. This will allow binder to bind props[0].name, props[1].name request params to command object even if original command.getProps() returns null or empty collection/array.  The approach must be used EACH controller which wants to work with dynamically added fields.  This could be fixed in SINGLE place - in BeanWrapperImpl#getPropertyValue(), which could allow collection/array to grow instead of simply (Array.get(value, Integer.parseInt(key)), list.get(Integer.parseInt(key)))  Or could we somehow override that method?  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.3  **Issue Links:** - #6368 Option to expose empty value instead of NullValueInNestedPathException - #10702 Data Binder: Auto-grow collections as needed to support nested property binding  7 votes, 9 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-04-18T23:58:16Z","2019-01-11T17:42:56Z"

My command object contains some collection/array as property. The user could add values via javascript which causes the respective request parameters are being added.  I've subclassed CancellableFormController to provide a cancel feature which it handles perfectly. However in some scenario it fails: 1. show form without 'collection/array' values 2. add some via javascript (will generate inputs with names: props[0].name,props[0].value,....props[n].name,props[n].value) 3. hit cancel 4. got binding error. The error type is depends on state of command object returning from formBackingObject: if 'props' value is empty we've got an NullValueInNestedPath; if 'props' contains, say single value, then submitting props[1].name,props[1].value will cause ArrayIndexOutOfBounds.  Suppressing binding will solve the problem.

We use the DefaultMessageListenerContainer class to achieve this. The DMCL delegates the task execution jobs to a WorkManagerTaskExecutor.  The problem encountered is that, when issuing a graceful shutdown command to stop the server, the DMCL does continue to schedule message listener invokers. The other server modules nicely shut down, though.  So, because the server doesn't shutdown, I tried to stop it with a ""force shutdown"" command, and even with an abrupt CTRL-C command in the command. Then, the server stops, but when it is restarted, it does not register any new consumer. I registered a WorkListener instance to log any WorkEvent received. A WORK_REJECTED event is emitted at startup:  2008-04-07 14:24:11,226 ERROR [eu.ec.digit.hrs.connector.internal.jms.support.WorkListenerImpl] - WORK_REJECTED - work item: [-8793173144596195636][0] executing: org.springframework.scheduling.commonj.DelegatingWork@3fe922 - exception: commonj.work.WorkException: commonj.work.WorkRejectedException: [WorkManager:002916]Request belonging to WorkManager springWorkmanager, application hrs is rejected as the WorkManager is shutdown commonj.work.WorkException: commonj.work.WorkRejectedException: [WorkManager:002916]Request belonging to WorkManager springWorkmanager, application hrs is rejected as the WorkManager is shutdown at weblogic.work.commonj.CommonjWorkManagerImpl$WorkStatus.setThrowable(CommonjWorkManagerImpl.java:244 ) at weblogic.work.j2ee.J2EEWorkManager$WorkWithListener$1.run(J2EEWorkManager.java:139) at weblogic.work.SelfTuningWorkManagerImpl$WorkAdapterImpl.run(SelfTuningWorkManagerImpl.java:464) at weblogic.work.ExecuteThread.execute(ExecuteThread.java:200) at weblogic.work.ExecuteThread.run(ExecuteThread.java :172) Caused by: commonj.work.WorkRejectedException: [WorkManager:002916]Request belonging to WorkManager springWorkmanager, application hrs is rejected as the WorkManager is shutdown ... 4 more commonj.work.WorkException: commonj.work.WorkRejectedException: [WorkManager:002916]Request belonging to WorkManager springWorkmanager, application hrs is rejected as the WorkManager is shutdown  I used a wrapper class to test the availability of the ""springWorkmanager"" object in the JNDI at startup, and it exist. So maybe does the DelegatingWork instance refer to the work manager from the previous server instance (through some persistent caching), and not from the actual one?  Anyway, the previous sentence is pure guess. I believe that the JMS consumer startup issue is a consequence of the fact that the server could not be stopped properly.  If we do not use a WorkManagerTaskExecutor, and thus fallback to a default SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor, then we have no issue at all. But then we loose thread management by the application server...  Please do not hesitate to ping me back if you need additional information.

See also ""_Design Considerations_"" below.  1. [x] Introduce a mechanism in the TCF that supports the following features:    1. [x] end the current test-managed transaction    2. [x] start a new test-managed transaction    3. [x] configure the current test-managed transaction to be _committed_ once the test completes    4. [x] configure the current test-managed transaction to be _rolled back_ once the test completes 2. [x] Refactor `TransactionalTestExecutionListener` to use this new mechanism internally. 3. [ ] Consider introducing a JUnit `TestRule` that simplifies the programming model (e.g., by delegating to the proposed `TestTransaction` façade).  ---  #### Design Considerations  Introduce a `TestTransaction` class that acts as a _façade_ to the functionality previously available in `TransactionalTestExecutionListener`. For example, `TestTransaction` could define methods that could provide the following API:  - `TestTransaction.start()` - `TestTransaction.end()` - `TestTransaction.rollback(boolean)`  ##### Options for Interacting with the Test Transaction  ###### Dependency Injection of TestTransaction  Ideally, we would like to be able to have the `TestTransaction` injected into our test instance. However, since the `DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener` must come before the `TransactionalTestExecutionListener` in the chain of listeners, dependency injection would only be possible by introducing yet another ""transactional"" `TestExecutionListener` that creates a proxy bean or bean of type `ObjectFactory` in the `ApplicationContext`. Such a _proxy_ bean would serve as a placeholder for dependency injection into the test instance, and the `TransactionalTestExecutionListener` could later set a value either directly in the proxy/`ObjectFactory` or via a `ThreadLocal`.  But we would like to avoid having two (2) `TestExecutionListener` implementations for transactional support. Plus, the placeholder-bean approach could present more problems than it solves.  ###### Dependency Injection of TestContext  A second option would be to inject the `TestContext` into test instances (see #12947) and provide access to the `TestTransaction` as an attribute (note that `TestContext` implements `AttributeAccessor`), but this would open up use of the `TestContext` within test classes (i.e., no longer limited to the `TestExecutionListener` API). In addition, developers would be forced to navigate the `TestContext` to obtain the `TestTransaction`, thus making the programming model less intuitive.  ###### Purely ThreadLocal Approach  The final option is to follow a purely `ThreadLocal`-based approach with `TestTransaction` encapsulating the details and providing static methods instead of instance methods.  ---  #### Related Resources  - [Diff for TransactionalTestExecutionListener](http://springframework.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/springframework/spring/tiger/mock/org/springframework/test/context/transaction/TransactionalTestExecutionListener.java?r1=1.11&r2=1.12).

This came out of some questions and brainstorming in a Spring training session in LA, 5/1/08 with Chris Beams, Tchavdar Ivanov (FIM) and myself.  In Spring 2.5 the implementation of HandlerInterceptor has not changed leaving you to either implement the interface or extend HandlerInterceptorAdapter as before.  If you use `@Controller` and component scan you still must define a DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping to configure a single list of HandlerInterceptors for all Controllers.  It'd be nice if you could define a class as a `@HandlerInterceptor` and annotate methods as `@AfterCompletion`,  `@PreHandle` and `@PostHandle`.  The default behavior could automagically intercept all `@Controllers` scanned and fire according to the same contract as the original HandlerInterceptor.  Also interaction could be similar to `@Controller` with the methods allowing use of `@ModelAttribute` and `@RequestParam`.  Example provided by Chris Beams:  ```java // @HandlerInterceptors are @Components, thus eligible for component scanning. // If no class args are supplied, the interceptor applies globally to all  // registered @Controllers.  Naturally, specifying one or more classes narrows  // its scope.  @HandlerInterceptor({AccountController.class, CustomerController.class}) public class ExceptionLoggingHandlerInterceptor { 	@AfterCompletion 	public void logException(Object handler, Throwable ex) { 		logger.error(...); 	}  	// Or to be more explicit, do it @AspectJ-style, using 	// attributes to bind by name  	@AfterCompletion(handler=""handler"", exception=""ex"") 	public void logException(Object handler, Throwable ex) { 		logger.error(...); 	}  	// In keeping with @Controller methods, the user could 	// request the request, response, model, etc.  	@AfterCompletion(handler=""handler"", exception=""ex"") 	public void logException(HttpServletRequest req, Object handler, Throwable ex) { 		logger.error(...); 	}  	// Could even have handler methods return @ModelAttributes!  	@PreHandle 	public @ModelAttribute(""currentDate"") Date currentDate(/* no params needed, none requested */) { 		return new Date(); 	}  } ```  Obviously there's a lot to be worked out.  Some questions we have are: - How do you express the order of the interceptors, something that comes naturally in the \ configuratin.  `@Order`? - Is it more natural to express the Controller classes the HandlerInterceptor applies to **in** the `@HandlerInterceptor` (above) or would something like `@Controller`(interceptors=(`@HandlerInterceptors`{class, class, ...})) be more expressive? which is more flexible?   - The later does express the list naturally but you would have to repeat the list in multiple controllers to achieve the same behavior.   - Maybe an XML annotation hybrid? \...\ and `@Controller`(interceptor=""authInterceptors"") - Could tooling help visualize how an `@Controller` relates to it `@HandlerInterceptors` (add bonus for sure!)  ---  **Issue Links:** - #17959 Apply Filter or Interceptor to Controller class via annotations (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #8695 Ability to restrict HandlerInterceptors to specific controller paths  14 votes, 16 watchers","closed","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2008-05-01T09:44:33Z","2019-01-11T17:43:41Z"

The label for the checkbox is being added as a child of the \ element, which is invalid since \ is defined as an empty element in the HTML DTD. Consequently, the labels are not being rendered on my browser (Firefox 2.0.0.11).  To illustrate what is happening, here is some sample output of what gets output for each item:  \\LABEL\\  The LABEL text ought to be ouput between the end of the \ and \ elements.  To fix, swap lines 254 and 255 of org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/form/CheckboxesTag.java so that the label text is output after - rather than before - the end of the \ tag.

If the bound property contains some EL syntax to access collections (e.g. uses [] to access a map) these characters will appear on the ID attribute.

For those of us using JSE instead of JEE, we often have programs for which some properties are configured by command line parameters.  It would therefore be convenient to be able to pass a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext upon construction for those properties that change from run-to-run. The main program would  o parse the command line o set up Properties from the command line arguments o construct a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer o then create the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext with the configurer as one of the constructor parameters.  This way, configuration can be divided into 2 sets of parameters: those configurable by file because they are common to all the runs of a given application (and thus they can be configured in the config file) and those configurable from the command line but still allowing the flexibility and non-lazy instantation of beans offered by an ApplicationContext.  Currently, the only way I see to do this is to use a BeanFactory and explicitly post process it. But the ApplicationContext offers some useful features above and beyond the BeanFactory.  That is, it appears that the only way to apply a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to an AppicationContext is to configure it in the XML.    --- No further details from [SPR-4268](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4268?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-18T07:10:08Z","2012-06-19T09:36:13Z"

The basic idea is that the helper object is transaction aware, so the user does not need to remember to flush, and doesn't need to know the size of the batch, or where all the data are coming from - he just issues update statements repeatedly to the same PreparedStatement, and when the transaction commits a TransactionSynchronization issues the batch update.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-05-24T16:13:14Z","2015-09-22T17:34:39Z"

The only real work will be migrating the StatefulRetryOperationsInterceptor (very useful).  It currently depends on ItemKeyGenerator and NewItemIdentifier, for good reasons, so equivalents will have to be provided.

When there is a cross cutting concern internally in a framework class, like transaction management in a message listener container (or in a PollingSourceAdapter in Spring Integration or a Step in Spring Batch), it would help a lot if the implementation could be split out from the main ""business"" logic.  But if the concern is implemented as an internal method call, there is no simple AOP approach (no pointcut), and also it is fiddly to explain to users that they have to use a particular AOP configuration just to enable a perfectly sensible feature (which probably is the default).  PollingSourceAdapter is interesting because (in 1.0.0.m4 at least) it implements Runnable, so it is quite possible to proxy it and add the cross cutting concern using Spring AOP (with no point cut).  This is quite elegant, but not accessible to the user - it has to be set up by whoever creates the PollingSourceAdapter, which is never expected to be a Spring component, so is naturally created in a framework factory somewhere.  But as an extender of that framework I would also like to be able to add other AOP interceptors to the same proxy - it seems the fundamental framework that provides the PollingSourceAdapter should be able to add those interceptors using a simple declarative API.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.2  **Attachments:** - [BatchMessageListenerContainer.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13987/BatchMessageListenerContainer.java) (_4.79 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-04-20T22:55:15Z","2015-09-22T17:34:37Z"

Interestingly, if the HTTP headers are set to expire after 1 second, MSIE happily shows the user the page from cache, even though it really HAS expired according to the protocol, so there's definitely (yet another) IE fault at play here too.  Firefox and Safari don't exhibit this issue at all.  There is no way to override this behaviour in the AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter class at present, so I'm wondering if the default behaviour can be made more flexible?  Ideally this would be by way of an attribute on the `@RequestMapping` (or maybe a new annotation) which could be read by the handler adapter.  If no value is supplied, it defaults to 0, thus preserving current system behaviour and backwards compatibility, otherwise it specifies the cache seconds to use.  Perhaps adding such an attribute to the RequestMapping/new annotation would provide more benefit in finer grained cache control for annotated controllers, falling back to that set on the handler adapter.  I'll write and test the patch if any of that sounds like it might be acceptable.  Or perhaps there's already some way to handle this that I missed..?   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  **Attachments:** - [SPR-4930.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14195/SPR-4930.patch) (_5.14 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-06-18T02:00:33Z","2012-12-07T04:02:48Z"

When configuring a MethodInvokingFactoryBean to invoke a static method with arguments, the usual configuration for lists is non-conventional for typical Spring property configuration.  The following configuration will cause a NoSuchMethodException for the following class when the ""configurator"" bean is retrieved from either a BeanFactory or an ApplicationContext:  public class DoStartup { public static MyConfig loadConfig(final List\ filenames) {  ....  } }  \ \\home.DoStartup\\ \\loadConfig\\ \ \ \baseconfig.xml\ \testconfig.xml\ \ \ \  In fact, Spring looks for DoWork.loadConfig(String, String) when loading this bean.  Also, overloading the static method with a varargs version does not workaround this problem (i.e. public static MyConfig DoWork.loadConfig(final String... configs) { .... } ).  The required (yet incorrect) configuration as determined from the referenced unit test at: http://kickjava.com/src/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/MethodInvokingFactoryBeanTests.java.htm is as follows:  \ \\home.DoStartup\\ \\loadConfig\\ \ \ \ \baseconfig.xml\ \testconfig.xml\ \ \ \ \  This may also be the behavior for non-static method invocations.  If MethodInvokingFactoryBean is supposed to operate this way, please express why.

With `@Autowired` on method level I cannot set the dependencies of the base class.

It works fine with remote SLSB but I can't figure out how to inject a remote SFSB.  For the SLSB, I use the following configuration which works fine:        I naturally need my remote SFSB session to last as long as my HTTP session lasts, and the session of the remote SFSB lasts as long as I hold a reference to the EJB proxy obtained from JNDI, so I guess I need to scope my JndiObjectFactoryBean to the web session.  Since, the  element doesn't allow to configure the scope, I use the old fashioned JndiObjectFactoryBean configuration style.

This is normal since we actually don't want the JNDI Proxy to be instanciated at this point. But JndiObjectFactoryBean actually knows what the type of the target bean is, through its proxyInterfaces property, and the AbstractBeanFactory.getType(String name) actually falls back to the JndiObjectFactoryBean.getObjectType method which eventually checks the proxyInterfaces so it should work !  The problem is that when the JndiObjectFactoryBean.getObjectType is called, the proxyInterfaces is null even if it has been properly configured on the BeanDefinition.  I don't know Spring AOP and Spring's lifecycle well enough to figure out what a possible solution might be. I tried moving the setBeanFactory body to the afterPropertiesSet method but it didn't change anything.  This problem might be related to a double proxy issue, which is mentionned here: http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=32645&highlight=ScopedProxyFactoryBean  Jörg Heinicke mentions that a possible solution might be to move the scoping behavior to an interceptor (or an Advice i guess) so as to avoid the double proxy problem.

With this resolver, it actually happens to ""lose"" a field. The behavior is really random, not only depending on the data posted in the form (multiple successive posts do not all cause the problem).  Digging a bit, it seems that the problem happens on the field on which a buffer is cut. To be more precised, we looked in a filter into requestFacade.request.inputBuffer.bb.buff where requestFacade is the request object we have in the filter. We looked into it using reflection.  Here are two examples of what we found in this buffer. With the first one, the field ""signatoryFirstName"" was missing, with the second it was ok.  I'm sorry I do not really have time to try and create a reproductible sample. It is really totally random and I have no clue on what's creating it.

That will return a UrlResource instance, which uses Java's URL classes to resolve the URL and get the data.  Commons HttpClient allows the use of connection pooling, configurable timeouts, and other such features. It would be great if Spring can take advantage of this easily.

I find the current implementation of Quartz under Spring is poor and assumes static job scheduling.   My application uses dynamic job scheduling, meaning that the time and duration of the jobs are not known prior to starting the program.   The times and durations of jobs are known only on the fly during the execution of the program.  Furthermore, I find that the current implement of Quartz under Spring kills and eliminates many of the powerful features of Quartz such as JobFactory and many other concepts.   It would be nice to have an interfacing with Quartz that preserves and respects all these powerful features.  I strongly suggest that the design of the interfacing with Quartz be reviewed and changes be made to accomodate Quartz better.   Additionally, it is not mentioned in the documentation whether one can use Quartz directly, thus bypassing the Spring interface to Quartz.   Some precisions on this topic would be appreciated.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-25T03:43:29Z","2015-09-22T18:20:30Z"

The javadoc of CacheManager#getCache(String) says:  ""Returns a concrete implementation of Cache, it it is available in the CacheManager.

If we change to use:-  paramSource.addValue(""long_text"", ""This is a very long text"", Types.VARCHAR);  in Oracle works as well.  After some investigation to org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtil s.setParameterValueInternal() method, it seems like CLOB is not handled and is delegated to setObject() of PreparedStatement, which means it will depends on the driver implementation of setObject() to do the conversion. I believe the Oracle driver implementation of setObject() is trying to cast the passed in String to CLOB type and raised the above exception.  Just my little suggestion, in setParameterValueInternal() method, would it make sense to rewrite the following:-  ... else if (sqlType == Types.VARCHAR) { ps.setString(paramIndex, inValue.toString()); } ...  to :-  ... else if (sqlType == Types.VARCHAR || sqlType == Types.CLOB) { ps.setString(paramIndex, inValue.toString()); } ...  So that for CLOB it is delegate to setString() instead of setObject(). I am not sure if it's the correct way of setting CLOB with setString(), or setCharacterStream() or setClob() is the better choice?

I'm using Spring in a webapp that generates some files into a directory in WEB-INF. This directory usually does not exist when the webapp starts. In Spring 2.0.x, I could configure that directory like this, where `targetDir` is a propery of type `java.io.File`:  ```  ```  A ServletContextResource was created for this path, and ServletContextResource.getFile() resolved the path relative to the webapp directory, no matter if the directory existed or not.  In Spring 2.5.x, this has changed: if `WEB-INF/generated` does not exist, FileEditor treats it as a path relative to the current directory, which depends on how the webapp container was started and is generally unpredictable.

This is fine, however, in most BeanDefinitionParser implementations (see ComponentScanBeanDefinitionParser, AnnotationDrivenBeanDefinitionParser) complex logic relating to which beans to register is tangled up with parsing the XML Element object passed in.  Ideally, we should decouple XML parsing from bean registration logic, probably through a simple delegation model.  The BeanDefinitionParser SPI (and all of our existing internal implementations' public interfaces) can remain the same.  parse() will continue to take an Element and a ParserContext.  However, parse() should be limited to parsing the XML Element into a object specific to the metadata contained in that element (see below in open issues regarding naming of those objects).  Once parsing is complete, the BeanDefinitionParser should delegate to an object that understands how to read that now-abstract metadata and register bean definitions that are appropriate given its values.  (naming: BeanDefinitionRegistrar?)  Open issues:  1) What do we call the abstract representation of the metadata coming from the namespace elements (or annotations in the JavaConfig case)?  For example, when parsing  it will be parsed into an object that looks something like:  public class XXX { private String[] basePackages; private boolean annotationConfig;      public void setBasePackages(String[] basePackages) {         this.basePackages = basePackages;     }          public String[] getBasePackages() {         return basePackages;     }          // other accessors ...  }  The question is, what should class XXX above be called?  What, fundamentally, **is** a namespace representing with regard to the Spring configuration model as a whole?   Consider the following - today in Spring XML we have what are simply referred to as 'namespaces':        JavaConfig, on the other hand, expresses this same metadata through a type-level annotation:      @ComponentScan(value=""..."", annotationConfig=false);  Same metadata, different vehicles for its transmission.  In the abstract, then, what is this metadata?  We could call XXX any of the following:  ComponentScanDescriptor ComponentScanDeclaration ComponentScanPlugin ComponentScanModule ComponentScanExtension  In some ways, I like 'descriptor': it connotes that the object is little more than a data holder, a struct if you will.  It is not expressive, however, about its role or purpose in the larger model.  Currently JavaConfig is referring to these things in the abstract as 'ConfigurationPlugin' instances, where ConfigurationPlugin is an interface.  2) ParserContext  We will also need to consider ParserContext, and any ties it has to XML.  JavaConfig will also need to make use of ParserContext (or something like it) in order to communicate bean/component registrations to Spring IDE.  ---  **Issue Links:** - [SJC-161](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SJC-161) Provide support equivalent to  (_**""is depended on by""**_) - [SJC-96](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SJC-96) `@AnnotationDrivenTx` - support equivalent to  (_**""is depended on by""**_) - [SJC-97](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SJC-97) Provide `@ComponentScan` annotation for support equivalent to  (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #12694 Introduce FeatureSpecifications for BeanDefinitionParsers as appropriate - #12078 Support Java-Based Application Configuration","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-19T06:34:35Z","2019-01-13T08:02:49Z"

For instance, Validator instances could be annotated as `@Component` and be subject to component scanning.  At any rate, whether declared via bean definitions or component scanned, registered Validator instances should be iterated through, and any returning true from Validator#supports() should be used to validate candidate objects.  Additionally, I believe the interface-based approach is preferable here, vs a `@Validator` approach, because the strong contract of supports()->validate() is a useful and expressive one.  It would be sufficient to simply allow Validator instances to be component scanned.  We just need to add iterating through and invoking registered validators to the lifecycle.  ---  **Issue Links:** - #4803 Support for declarative validation (Hibernate Validator, anticipating JSR 303) (_**""duplicates""**_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-02T16:12:53Z","2019-01-11T18:33:12Z"

It would be good to have the JavaDoc be explicit about this.  This came up when considering the fact that `@Inherited` is not supported on interfaces, and that the reason for this is that it avoids a 'multiple annotation inheritance' problem (if you will).

Implementing this looks like it will involve overriding visitOuterClass() within ClassMetadataReadingVisitor.  Here's an oversimplified example:      public void visitOuterClass(String owner, String name, String desc) {     	this.declaringClassName = ClassUtils.convertResourcePathToClassName(owner);     }  It's incomplete because it doesn't consider name and desc.  These params are non-null only if the underlying class is a local or anonymous inner class.  I haven't thought out what to do in this case -- perhaps nothing different at all.  This feature is needed by JavaConfig in order to eliminate use of Class.forName() internally. (See [SJC-53](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SJC-53) for more detail).  However, it is not urgent.  I have a workaround for this, if an ugly one:      public class NestedClassTypeFilter implements TypeFilter {     	public boolean match(MetadataReader metadataReader, MetadataReaderFactory metadataReaderFactory) {                         // when encountering class names like com.foo.Outer$Inner, assume that it is a nested class.     		return metadataReader.getClassMetadata().getClassName().contains(""$"");     	}     }  (Technically, someone could define a top level class with '$' in the name, and this implementation would produce a false positive.  I'm okay with that being a known issue in the meantime)  If and when this feature implemented, I'll be able to change the implementation to the following:      public class NestedClassTypeFilter implements TypeFilter {     	public boolean match(MetadataReader metadataReader, MetadataReaderFactory metadataReaderFactory) {     		return metadataReader.getClassMetadata().hasDeclaringClass();     	}     }  Of course, NestedClassTypeFilter could be added to core as well if it looks generally useful.

Here is an example child:  Code:  `@Controller` `@RequestMapping`(""/child/test"") public class ChildController extends ParentController {      @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)     public void doGet(                 HttpServletRequest req,                 HttpServletResponse resp,                 @RequestParam(""childId"") String childId             ) throws IOException, ServletException {                  resp.getWriter().write(             ""I am GET for childId: "" + childId + """");     }  }  You'll notice that ""child"" also uses `@RequestParam` which is really slick for grabbing req params, which is one of the reasons I went this route as opposed to using something like SimpleServletHandlerAdapter and manually pulling the param(s) out of the req.  When I deploy this controller and navigate to it with something like: http://localhost:8080/bug-test/child/test?childId=99  I get a 404 error, and a log message of: [WARN] PageNotFound - No matching handler method found for servlet request: path '/child/test', method 'GET', parameters map['childId' -> array\['99']]  This same configuration works in 2.5 final. Also, if I take out the `@RequestParam` in child, it works under 2.5.4. The addition of `@RequestParam` is what makes it break in 2.5.4.  -Chris   ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final, 2.5.4  **Attachments:** - [testcase.jar](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/14068/testcase.jar) (_12.20 kB_)","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-05-06T09:42:26Z","2012-06-19T03:47:08Z"

(Please ignore the issue #9809, I tried cloning #6739 and changing the Spring versionm, but apparently I'm not allowed to move it once I clone. So I've created this brand new issue)  I want to re-open this issue as it has more bugs in my opinion. CallableStatementCreatorFactory.CallableStatementCreatorImpl.createCallableStatement(Connection) has the following lines:  if ((declaredParameter).isInputValueProvided() || inValue != null) { StatementCreatorUtils.setParameterValue(csToUse, sqlColIndx, declaredParameter, inValue); }  As one would expect, SqlOutParameter returns false for isInputValueProvided(), whereas SqlInOutParameter returns true for it. Now the problem is with the second part of the if check: ... || inValue != null)  I think this is defying the whole purpose of SqlOutParameter class and its isInputValueProvided() method, because even though that method is returning false (implying that no value should be set on a strictly output parameter), we go ahead and set it.  This causes issue on a next call which actually passes in NULL as a value of the parameter, at which time Spring doesn't honor the value and set it on the statement. And this causes issues with the value that is passed in to the stored procedure later on since we use the same statement due to statement caching and we don't set the value to NULL.  What is the purpose of that (inValue != null) check? I think ANY value should be delegated to the statement to avoid issues. Was this done to keep backwards compatibility? I find this quite dangerous if it's done for that purpose. Can we get this fixed?

This method should only ever return EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE, SKIP_BODY, or EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED.  To fix the problem simply modify Line 51 of org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.AbstractHtmlElementBodyTag from ""return EVAL_PAGE;"" to ""return SKIP_BODY;"", as I am pretty sure this is the behaviour that the author was going for.  This defect results in inconsistent behaviour about how nested contents of the tag are handled. For example, consider the following code:   Do something to indicate an error ocurred, e.g. wrap an entire section with a div   In jetty, this will only display the contents of the tag if an error is bound to bean.property. In weblogic, we've found that the contents always display, regardless of whether an error has occurred or not.  This inconsistency is fair enough as the spec doesn't mandate how the container should handle unknown responses from the doStartTag method of a custom tag and obviously jetty and weblogic have different default behaviour.

The main servlet is 2,000+ lines long with many if/else if clauses that depend on a parameter in the URL.  There are close to 250 separate commands.  My first pass before Spring was to pull out if/else code into about 40 objects grouped by command type and have the servlet become a dispatcher, meaning I had a mappingObject that took in a value and returned a CommandObject which was then executed - worked fine.  The initial change to Spring was not much.  My servlet entry in web.xml became a DispatcherServlet.  My servlet became an AbstractController and WebApplicationContext mapped everything to this one Controller.  Everything still worked, but I am essentially being a dispatcher  However, when I started to try to get Spring to do the dispatching I do not see a HandlerMapping object that will mapping a request parameter value to a Controller bean.  All I see is the MultiActionController with a methodNameResolver and a delegate object.  Implementing this would end up with a delegate object as large as the original servlet.  I think what I want is something named UrlParameterHandlerMapping, here looking for the parameter 'command' and mapping values to Controllers                                                         loginController                    userEditController                              Thus, this functionality is analogous to SimpleUrlHandlerMapping, but on a parameter, and seems to be a reasonable thing to do.  Now, I understand that changing the app to use URL path extensions would allow the existing HandlerMapping to work.

Included in the WASv6.1 bundled com.ibm.ws.runtime-6.1.0.jar are the API classes referenced in the WebSphereUowTransactionManager, but under different java packages. For example, WebSphereUowTransactionManager imports com.ibm.wsspi.uow.UOWManager, but com.ibm.ws.runtime-6.1.0.jar has this packaged under the slightly different com.ibm.ws.uow.UOWManager.  Spring 2.5.1 includes a supporting WebSphere API jar for these interfaces, included in the 'with-dependencies' download (websphere/websphere_uow_apis.jar). Again, these interfaces are packaged in a location inconsistent with our WASv6.1 libraries. I also looked closely at the WASv6.0 libraries a few weeks ago. If I remember correctly, these interfaces were packaged differently again in that release... Specifically, a different jar, but in the same java package as WASv6.1, thus inconsistent still with the WebSphereUowTransactionManager.  The JavaDoc for the WebSphereUowTransactionManager class specifies it supports WASv7.0, v6.1, and v6.0: ""This transaction manager is compatible with WebSphere 7.0 as well as recent WebSphere 6.0.x and 6.1.x versions.""  So it seems as though the WebSphereUowTransactionManager only supports WASv7.0, which is not yet final, and not WASv6.x.

This works very well if no proxying is involved. However, when AOP is used and a proxy of the controller is created (implementing the appropriate interface, where the interface has `@RequestMapping` at type and method level), then it fails.  The code in DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping properly finds `@RequestMapping` at type level in the interface (since it uses AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation), but then it looks for method-level annotations in DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping.determineUrlsForHandlerMethods()  This method only looks at the implementation class (the proxy), and finds no such annotation.  It should use the same kind of logic that AnnotationUtils does, and check the method declaration in the relevant interface(s) for any annotation there. Alternatively, perhaps declaring `@RequestMapping` as `@Inheritable` would suffice? Not sure. In any case, it should be simple to find the interfaces, get the right method, and check for annotations there.  The reason I prefer JDK proxies to CGLIB-based ones is because when we use CGLIB, it creates memory leaks when the application is reloaded in Tomcat, while JDK proxies don't have this problem.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4  1 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-14T04:51:29Z","2019-01-11T15:27:15Z"

Most of the time, those kinds of values are primitives).  Typically, such configuration values come from properties files and are made available via variants of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.  However, in such an environment this is difficult to achieve since Strings, Integers, etc are not considered component types (see http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-3744).  One solution to this issue is what Solomon writes about:  An `@Value` annotation with property resolution... For example:  `@Autowire`  public void setI(`@Value`(""${i}"") int i)  With a property file entry:  i=5  This seems very natural and seems to be the annotation configuration based version of Java Config's `@ExternalValue` (see http://www.thespringexperience.com/blog/rod_johnson/2007/11/spring_java_configuration_moving_ahead.html)  If this is a sensible approach, consider unifying the two annontations to be common.   ---  **Attachments:** - [spring2.5-configuration.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13738/spring2.5-configuration.zip) (_17.52 kB_)  3 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-11T00:42:01Z","2012-06-19T03:46:38Z"

The problem is that only the first portlet being rendered gets access to the scopes ""request"" and ""session"" and all the portlets being rendered afterwards terminate rendering due to an IllegalStateException (RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes(), line 120). However, as it worked perfectly when there was only one portlet I didn't thought of a configuration error but rather a bug in either the portal server or Spring itself (I've used the RequestContextFilter with the dispatcher methods ""REQUEST"", ""INCLUDE"" and ""FORWARD"" being mapped).  Now, according to the exception stack trace the portal server executes this filter for each portlet (just as I would have expected), but the filter proceeds without ""invoking itself"", i.e. the OncePerRequestFilter thinks that it already has been executed. Note that there is a different request object for each portlet (i.e. there is a different request object for each time the filter is executed), but it seems that the portal server passes request attributes on even though the filter is provided with different request objects. However, by using a rewritten version of the RequestContextFilter that cleans up the request attributes afterwards, everything works fine and therefore I'd suggest to patch the OncePerRequestFilter class accordingly.   ---  **Affects:** 2.0.8, 2.5.2  **Attachments:** - [SPR-4621.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13825/SPR-4621.patch) (_932 bytes_)  **Backported to:** [2.0.9](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/46?closed=1)","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-24T04:45:07Z","2012-06-19T03:46:52Z"

This hook is required to implement a ""lazy enlistment"" transaction manager.  A ""lazy-enlistement"" transaction manager differs from Springs ""out-the-box"" single resource transaction managers in that transaction resources (JMS connections or JDBC connections) are bound to the transaction when they are first used. The transaction manager collects resources during the life of the transaction rather than forcing developers to declare the resources they anticipate they will use upfront. Our developers find this programming model simpler and vastly reduces configuration overhead. Once a transaction manager is defined and code executed inside the transaction boundary any resources used are implicitly bound to the transaction.  The following pattern is used extensively throughout Springs resource handling code, for example in DataSourceUtils and ConnectionFactoryUtils:  public Resource doGetResource(ResourceFactory factory) {  Resource resource = getResourceFromTSM(factory);  // (1) resource found in transaction if (resource != null){ return resource; }  // (2) resource not found, create a new resource resource = factory.getResource();  if (isSynchronizationActive()) { addResourceToTSM(factory,resource); addSynchronizationToCleanupResource(resource); }  return resource; }  Branch (2) may appear to show lazy creation of the resource however this can't be used for the following reasons:      * No mechanism exists to get notified of the resource's addition to the TransactionSynchronizationManager.     * The resource cleanup synchronization may cleanup the resource before the transaction manager enters the commit phase (as a result of closing of the connection in beforeCompletion). There is no way to disable this synchronization from been added.     * There is no control over configuration of the resource, for example, after getting a JDBC Connection (the Resource) from a DataSource (the ResourceFacotry?) one must disable auto-commit in addition to other connection preparation such as configuring the isolation level.   Spring's transaction managers pre-populate the TransactionSynchronizationManager with the resource(s) they will manage so transactional resources are always found and branch (1) is taken.  A transaction manager supporting ""lazy enlistment"" would need to plug in its own resource resolution strategy before Spring takes its fallback logic in (2).  We propose an extension point to be added to TransactionSynchronizationManager. A sketch of the extension point API is shown below:  interface TransactionResourceResolver { public Object resolveResource(Object key); }  The following API would be used to register a custom strategy with the current transaction:  TransactionSynchronizationManager.setResourceResolver( resolver );  resolveResource() is invoked from TransactionSynchronizationManager#getResource(key) when the key is unbound. To clarify, the logic in getResource() would follow this pattern:  public Object getResource(Object key) {  // 1) Check resources map Object resource = resources.get(key);  if (resource != null){ return resource; }  // 2) Consult custom strategy Object resource = resolver.resolveResource(key); if (resource != null) { resources.put(key, resource); return resource; }  // 3) Give up return null; }  This small extension enables the implementation of the ""lazy enlistment"" Transaction Manager. Note, this is similar to the request in #7996. This new issue clarifies the requests made in the comments with a focus on lazy enlistment.  ---  **Issue Links:** - #7996 Provide listener for TransactionSynchronizationManager  6 votes, 10 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-23T20:50:40Z","2019-01-11T14:33:42Z"

We make use of aliases to assign different roles to beans in cases where a single bean is providing multiple roles, for example:  \  This is convenient as we can later remove the alias if we decide we need to use a different implementation for 'db_a'.  During high level testing we'd like to mock out 1 or more of these roles. For example, we'd like to say anything that uses bean 'db_a' should use this mock instead. Our framework loads the real production XML configuration file and using a BFPP we massage the container to swap out some beans for mocks. If 'db_a' was a regular bean we could quite easily remove its definition from the registry and just register our mock as a singleton with the BF. However if we are using aliases this isn't possible as no API exists to remove from the alias map.  Could a public API be added to AbstractBeanFactorty to manage this map? Something like:  void removeAlias(String beanName) void isAlias(String beanName)  With the usual caveats that once the factory is refreshed any mutation of aliases may lead to an inconsistent state?  The alternatives we've found - extending AbstractBeanFactory to intercept calls to regsiterAlias(), caching, then flushing once we have made our modifications - seem a bit fragile.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-02-12T04:46:37Z","2012-06-19T03:47:17Z"

We need to wait for all the threads to stop so we can then shutdown dependent components in the application (we don't want to shut these down until all message processing is complete). So we used shutdown(), however after shutdown the container can't be re-started!. So we use stop() but then we don't know when the stop is complete.  A simple option would be adding a stopAndWait() API that would block the calling thread until the containers threads are stopped. But we'd like to stop all our containers (we may have >10 in the application) concurrently. A nice way to do this is to give a callback to stop() to be invoked on completion.  // notifies the containers threads to stop, invokes the callback when all threads are done. void stop( CompletionCallback completionCallback )  Where CompletionCallback is (could use Runnable?):  interface CompletionCallback { public void complete(); }  We can then await stopping something like:  final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch( containers.size ) CompletionCallback callback = new CompletionCallback()   {    void complete() { latch.countDown(); } };  for( DMLC container : containers )  { container.stop( callback ); }  latch.await();  If this API doesn't seem generally useful would it be possible to provide a subclass hook to allow this as the monitor & counters are not visible (looks like something that could be easily refactored out of doShutdown()).

The intent is to test the Spring wiring & post-processing (which in many Spring apps provides a great deal of functionality beyond dependency injection, eg AOP, WebServices) so manual wiring is not sufficient.  A current example faced by the reporter is interaction-testing web service beans exposed via XFire/Spring using JSR181 `@WebService`. We want to test the web services but mock out the backing business logic components.  The solution I envisage would be to support binding of the trained mock object into the context under a given bean Id, at a defined lifecycle point before normal bean instantiation proceeds.  However, there appears to be no such facility in the spring architecture. This is presumably a deliberate, considered decision and there may be significant obstacles to the above outlined solution.

These classes use org.apache.log4j.NDC (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/NDC.html) to store thread specific logging data (like url, client info).  NDC holds these diagnostic information in a static Hashtable. The entries in these table have the current Thread as key and a Stack as value. Calling NDC's push() can create a new entry in the table if there were none, and push the parameter into the Stack. However pop() only removes elements from the Stack, and does not remove the whole entry. That's why NDC's api states that users should call NDC.remove(), to remove the entry from the static Hashtable. However Spring is not calling that method (only push, pop). This is the reason why a reference is kept in the entries key to the Thread objects and this leads to OutOfMemory pretty fast (application servers with Thread pooling could be not affected but those creating new Thread objects are).  Log4j api says that the best place to call NDC.remove(), would be at the end of the Thread run, but thats not configable in case of an application server.  So there could be more possibility to fix this: 1. Never call NDC.remove() but state in the api that user should be aware of this. 2. Call NDC.remove() always (this is not appropiate for those who use NDC before Log4jNestedDiagnosticContextFilter too). 3. Call NDC.remove() if NDC.getDepth() returns the same in beforeRequest, afterRequest (could still lead to memory leak, if someone uses push without a pairing pop). 4. Make it configable in the filter if it should call NDC.remove() or not (making the removal the default option). 5. Make a cleaning thread and call NDC.remove() there because NDC.remove() removes all not alive Thread objects also from the Hashtable (this could be an overkill for this).    ---  **Affects:** 2.5.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-08-19T18:47:20Z","2012-06-19T03:46:51Z"

"","9228","@RequestMapping method resolution is not deterministic [SPR-4551]","**[Ari Miller](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ari1974)** opened **[SPR-4551](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4551?redirect=false)** and commented  My description of the problem below uses the 2.5.2 version of the classes described.  Note the problem also occurs in 2.5.1.  We believe we have discovered an issue with the RequestMapping method resolution logic, that can cause particular requests to be handled by the wrong RequestMapping method based on the order in which the controller methods are returned by Class.getDeclaredMethods() (which is not deterministic).  The AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.ServletHandlerMethodResolver.resolveHandlerMethod will return the appropriate method to invoke for a given request.  It starts with a series of methods that might potentially be used to handle the request, based on the `@RequestMapping` annotating those methods in the target handler.  The problems stems from the dependency on initial order in the logic used to select from multiple potential methods:  Lines 452 - 472 of AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter: [CODE] else if (!targetHandlerMethods.isEmpty()) { RequestMappingInfo bestMappingMatch = null; String bestPathMatch = null; for (RequestMappingInfo mapping : targetHandlerMethods.keySet()) { String mappedPath = targetPathMatches.get(mapping); if (bestMappingMatch == null) { bestMappingMatch = mapping; bestPathMatch = mappedPath; } else { if ((mappedPath != null && (bestPathMatch == null || mappedPath.equals(lookupPath) || bestPathMatch.length() < mappedPath.length())) || (bestMappingMatch.methods.length == 0 && mapping.methods.length > 0) || bestMappingMatch.params.length < mapping.params.length) { bestMappingMatch = mapping; bestPathMatch = mappedPath; } } } return targetHandlerMethods.get(bestMappingMatch); } [/CODE] Note that the if((mappedPath != null ... )  logic gives multiple possible opportunities for a method to be deemed a betterMappingMatch than the current best match.  Given certain requestMapping annotations, this results in whichever method is last in the LinkedHashMap targetHandlerMethods being returned, because the last method will meet one of the || conditions in that if statement.  Here is a specific example, with two methods on a single controller that could handle an incoming request with the path /enterAccessCode.do:  `@RequestMapping`(""/**/enterAccessCode.do"") public ModelAndView methodWithPathMapping      -- this is the method we want to handle the request  `@RequestMapping`(method = {RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST}) public ModelAndView methodWithMethodMapping()  Say the LinkedHashMap targetHandlerMethods has the following order: 1. methodWithPathMapping 2. methodWithMethodMapping  Initially, the bestMappingMatch starts with methodWithPathMapping. When it gets to the if statement, methodWithMethodMapping becomes the bestMappingMatch, because this part of the statement is true: (bestMappingMatch.methods.length == 0 && mapping.methods.length > 0) This is not the desired behavior.  If you have the reverse order: 1. methodWithMethodMapping 2. methodWithPathMapping  methodWithMethodMapping starts out as the bestMappingMatch, but know the first part of the if statement is true, so methodWithPathMapping becomes the best match.  As to this not being deterministic: HandlerMethodResolver.handlerMethods is a LinkedHashSet created based on ReflectionUtils.doWithMethods, which in turn depends on the result of targetClass.getDeclaredMethods() (Javadoc declares:  The elements in the array returned are not sorted and are not in any particular order).   HandlerMethodResolver.handlerMethods is iterated through to create targetHandlerMethods, which is once again then not in a deterministic order.  We've seen this result in different behavior depending on the JVM (and I think hardware) -- some hardware consistently uses the appropriate method to handle the incoming request, some hardware, because of the different method order, uses the inappropriate methodWithMethodMapping. Our workaround for this is to avoid having our general handler use method = {RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST} for the methodWithMethodMapping -- this makes all of the if statement || blocks false. My claim is that the logic to determine the best mapping match in the if block should be insensitive to initial order when finding the bestMappingMatch.  Here is a crude and untested way to accomplish that: Replace: [CODE] if ((mappedPath != null && (bestPathMatch == null || mappedPath.equals(lookupPath) || bestPathMatch.length() < mappedPath.length())) || (bestMappingMatch.methods.length == 0 && mapping.methods.length > 0) || bestMappingMatch.params.length < mapping.params.length) { bestMappingMatch = mapping; bestPathMatch = mappedPath; } [/CODE] with  [CODE] private boolean isBetterPathMatch(String mappedPath, String mappedPathToCompare, String lookupPath) { return (mappedPath != null && (mappedPathToCompare == null || mappedPath.equals(lookupPath) || mappedPathToCompare.length() < mappedPath.length())); }  private boolean isBetterMethodMatch(RequestMappingInfo mapping, RequestMappingInfo mappingToCompare) { return mappingToCompare.methods.length == 0 && mapping.methods.length > 0; }  private boolean isBetterParamMatch(RequestMappingInfo mapping, RequestMappingInfo mappingToCompare) { return mappingToCompare.params.length < mapping.params.length; }  if (isBetterPathMatch(mapppedPath, bestPathMatch, lookupPath) || (! isBetterPathMatch(bestPathMatch, mappedPath, lookupPath) && isBetterMethodMatch(mapping, bestMappingMatch)) || (! isBetterPathMatch(bestPathMatch, mappedPath, lookupPath) && ! isBetterMethodMatch(bestMappingMatch, mapping) && isBetterParamMatch(mapping, bestMappingMatch)) { bestMappingMatch = mapping; bestPathMatch = mappedPath; } [/CODE]  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1, 2.5.2  **Attachments:** - [4551Fix.diff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13743/4551Fix.diff) (_2.63 kB_) - [AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13745/AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.java) (_29.97 kB_) - [SpringAnnotationMethodHandlerAdapterNotDeterministicTest.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/13744/SpringAnnotationMethodHandlerAdapterNotDeterministicTest.java) (_3.74 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #9744 `@RequestMapping` method resolution issue with duplicate paths","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-06T04:32:16Z","2019-01-13T08:04:54Z"

In such cases, there is a fourth solution:  * override the setter and use the `@Qualifier` annotation as follows (where ""myDataSource"" is the bean id of the desired DataSource):    `@Override`   `@Autowired`   public void setDataSource(`@Qualifier`(""myDataSource"") DataSource dataSource) {   super.setDataSource(dataSource);   }  This solution is currently documented on the support forum at least twice: http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=48997 http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=47468  It therefore sounds like something that needs to be in the Reference Docs, right in para 2 of Section 8.3.7.3 (""Dependency Injection of test fixtures"") where it's needed.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.2","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-14T17:27:11Z","2012-06-19T03:46:36Z"

Let's have a look at some examples:  1) public String handleRequest(User user)  User is an custom application domain class that extends javax.security.Principal. I'd like to get injected the logged-in user from request.getPrincipal(), cast appropriately. A variation of this usecase would be to get the logged-in user from an application-specific session attribute.  2) public String handleRequest(`@IsParameterPresent`(""parameterName"") boolean isPresent)  Sometimes, I just want to check if a specific request parameter is present. I'm not interested in the actual value.  3) public String handleRequest(`@PathPart` int articleId)  This idea is probably generic enough to qualify for a built-in solution. But for the sake of an example, I'll list it nevertheless. `@PathPart` would extract one of the matched wildcards in a path mapping, which can be aquired with request.getAttribute(HandlerMapping.PATH_WITHIN_HANDLER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE). Full parameter binding similar to `@RequestParam` should happen here.

In this case, I cannot distinguish by method, and I do not want to distinguish by parameter (the naming of the parameters is up to Spring Binding / Tag Library).  2) Mapping only matches if parameter is not present  Although not needed as urgently as 1), it would make `@RequestMappings` easier to formulate and a bit more robust.

I'm biased towards ""or"", because it's more likely to grant an access to multiple roles than to require multiple roles in combination (I could be wrong).  General considerations:  - Instead of throwing the exception, something like response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN) could be more appropriate.  - `@AccessRestriction` should be allowed at Method-level and Class-level, perhaps even Package-level would make sense. Restrictions should be inherited, just like with `@RequestMappings`.  - more ideas for Access Restrictions, but not that common: Needs HttpSession, Host names/IPs.    ---  **Affects:** 2.5.1","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-17T21:08:08Z","2012-06-19T09:36:31Z"

Implementing an interface like LastModified would be old-style (no subclassing). Thus, I'd like to propose passing the if-modified-since date into the request handling method either as a java.util.Date or a long, tagged with an annotation such as `@IfModifiedSince`. The handling method can then decide either to handle the request as usual, or to return a 304 (Not Modified) response. The 304 could perhaps be abstracted away by just returning null or something.  The aggregation of getLastModified() and handleRequest*() into one method has several advantages:  - You only need to call your service method(s) once. With the old-style, you had to either buffer service results in request scope (awkward), or call services twice and rely on efficient caching (awkward, too).  - You can use binding mechanisms. Old-style, if you extend BaseCommandController (or subclass), binding would not happen on getLastModified(), only on handleRequestInternal().  - You do not need to catch exceptions. Old-style, getLastModified() does not allow any exceptions to be thrown, while handleRequest*() allows every Exception (which is very convenient in the web layer).    ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2007-12-25T07:29:43Z","2012-06-19T03:47:26Z"

The real root cause for seeing this issue is that, with ""my"" JMS provider, calling qcf.createConnection() on a WaveQueueConnectionFactory instance qcf only creates a WaveConnection (which only implements connection, but not QueueConnection), but calling qcf.createQueueConnection() creates a WaveQueueConnection (which implements both).  I would propose to fix this with the following if ... then ... else in SingleConnectionFactory#doCreateConnection() that ensures that the appropriate create method is being called:      protected Connection doCreateConnection() throws JMSException {                 ConnectionFactory connfac = getTargetConnectionFactory();                 Connection conn = null;                 if (connfac instanceof QueueConnectionFactory) {                     conn = ((QueueConnectionFactory) connfac).createQueueConnection();                 } else if (connfac instanceof TopicConnectionFactory) {                     conn = ((TopicConnectionFactory) connfac).createTopicConnection();                 } else {                     conn = connfac.createConnection();                 }     	return conn;     }  I do perfectly know that a SingleConnectionFactory102 exists which properly handles this, but (a) my provider is JMS 1.1 compliant and (b) I would rather like to use CachedConnectionFactory (not directly SingleConnectionFactory).  I admit that, if you prefer, this issue could also be resolved by adding a CachedConnectionFactory102 that extends SingleConnectionFactory102.

"","8989","There are some issues we face using spring hibernate. I made a utility to solve these. [SPR-4310]","**[Amit Khosla](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=amit.khosla)** opened **[SPR-4310](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4310?redirect=false)** and commented  Hibernate Utility The utility is an attempt to solve issues we face daily while using hibernate. Currently we are solving these four problems:  1) Updating an object:    Problem:    If we are saving an object which has some properties which are null, if we update the object, we will find that in the database it remove those values from database.     Example:    In a student table, having fields: name, address, roll no & standard. Now, suppose, if admin of this school, wants to update address. For doing so, we are displaying a form where the admin changes the address & submit the page. At server, we get id of the student & address of the student. Now, to save this information, either we need to load an object of student (means retrieving all the info which we don't want & unnecessary hit to database) or creating new object of student setting id & address. In the second approach we didn't set values for name, roll no & standard. So while updating we will loss this information.     Solution:    Call method of the the tool, update (student, ""studentId""); student is the object of Student class having just studentId & address set.This is all you need to do.  2) Projections:    Problem:    If we are using projections (selection of selective columns), hibernate will return you list of object array or list of object.     Example:    If we want to retrieve name & roll no. from the student table, what we will receive will be list. Each item in list will be array of object, whose 0th index will have name as String & 1st index will have roll no. as long. It is difficult to parse this data & we have to send this data in form of objects from dao layer to manager layer.     Sample:    Instead of parsing this list containing name & roll no, we will get student object using a method of the utility.  3) Writing HQL    Problem:    We often need to write HQL of same pattern. Like selecting these fields from this table, for some conditions & then we need to order them as well. It takes some amount of time to do this again & again.     Sample:    Just call method smartList (student.class, ""name"", where array, orderby array) will return list of students.  4) Paging code:    Problem:    We have to use paging in each of application we work. Again we need to do the same kind of effort again & again for each different paging data we want.     Sample:    We just need to call the method to get the list of pojos for a page & the total number of records in the table.  If it make sense to use this kind of utility please reply.   --- No further details from [SPR-4310](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4310?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-01-09T02:29:12Z","2012-06-19T09:36:22Z"

My scenario is as follows - I'd like to create a Facade bean. This bean only delegates activity to other (service) beans. I'd like the Facade to only be an interface, and at runtime glue an invocation handler to it using a proxy. To do this I have to create the Facade by using a FactoryBean.  What I'd like to be able to do is to define my Facade interface using annotations only, for example:  `@Facade`(delegates={""a"",""b""}) `@FactoryBean`(name=""facadeFactory"") public interface MyFacade { ... }  the ""`@Facade`"" is my custom stereotype, and I expect that `@FactoryBean` would be a spring annotation.  thanks, Amir   --- No further details from [SPR-4976](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-4976?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-02T19:41:11Z","2012-06-19T09:36:25Z"

Currently you can set up a configuration that fails with NullPointerExceptions as follows:  1. Set up a Spring MessageSource as per normal 2. Set up a custom JSTL BundleSupport tag that gets the bundle from the page LocalizationContext  and calls bundle.getLocale() to do something 3. Use the Spring JstlView to forward to a page containing above tag  It sounds a little convoluted on paper, but it can be useful to inspect the locale set on the bundle.  In our case, we have an translator development mode setting where we can set our JSTL tags to print out additional information if the locale of the bundle is equal to a specified development locale.

The language is detected by the controller, which stores it in the model. This is passed to a custom view, derived from AbstractView, which loads the localized XSLT file every time it's called. If the ""XsltView"" would allow a placeholder in the Url property, the view could substitute it with a parameter in the model which stores the language and then the view could select the XSLT file and cache the right XSLT source. In this way, the view could store a map of (lang, XSLT) to use for the presentation. Obviously, the language is just a possibility of the use of the placeholder.

I also think that the following statement is wrong:  this.callString = ""{? = call "" + getSql() + ""("";  because the ""="" should be precedeed with "":"", i. e.:  this.callString = ""{? := call "" + getSql() + ""("";  Moreover, the last ""("" sholud be present only if there is at least one parameter passed: if none is provided then the ""("" should not be written to the ""callString"". This problem occurs when I specify the name of the stored proc only and so ""compileInternal()"" is called. If I call ""setSql()"" and ""setSqlReadyForUse(true)"" then the method is skipped.  In the class ""CallableStatementCreatorFactory.CallableStatementCreatorImpl"", the method ""createCallableStatement"" does not call ""registerOutParameter"" for the return value: see line 185, in the loop to register parameters, where, if the parameter is a result then it's skipped, but, at line 189 there is a test with ""instanceof"" to check if the parameter is a result (!). This always occurs.  I detected these problems with the following code.  TestStoredProcedure toTest = new TestStoredProcedure(my_datasource, ""package.function""); SqlParameter[] parameters = new SqlParameter[2]; Map inParams = new HashMap(); Map result = null;  /* * The SQL function returns a SYS_REFCURSOR: JDBC can only handle it as ""Object"" and then I have to cast it to ""ResultSet""; * anyway I wanted to try if Spring has any automations about it; you can use a normal ""SqlOutParameter"" of type ""Types.OTHER"" if this is not the case.   */   parameters[0] = new SqlReturnResultSet(""my_result"", new BeanPropertyRowMapper(SomeClassWithProperties.class));   parameters[1] = new SqlParameter(""only_parameter_for_function"", Types.INTEGER);   inParams.put(""my_result"", null);   inParams.put(""only_parameter_for_function"", new Integer(1));   toTest.setFunction(true);   toTest.setParameters(parameters);   // the two following lines are activated to avoid problem in SqlCall, just comment them to detect it   toTest.setSql(""{call ? := package.function(?)}"");   toTest.setSqlReadyForUse(true);   toTest.afterPropertiesSet();   result = toTest.execute(inParams);  I obtain the following exception from Oracle: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01008: not all variables bound  I didn't find anything about calling stored functions (neither in Google nor in Spring-Jira) so I posted here my investigations.

For instance 'date'.  This would allow to define an alias with \_ and will map it to the java corresponding property. For instance column date_ will be mapped to the java bean property date.  One possible implementation, tested and running successfully in our environment is to add the following 3 lines of code to the method initialize(Class):      String underscoredNameSuffixed = underscoredName + ""_"";     if (!pd.getName().toLowerCase().equals(underscoredNameSuffixed)) {     	this.mappedFields.put(underscoredNameSuffixed, pd);     }  These lines were added directly added after the following piece of code: String underscoredName = underscoreName(pd.getName()); if (!pd.getName().toLowerCase().equals(underscoredName)) { this.mappedFields.put(underscoredName, pd); }  I hope this small enhancement will be added.  Cheers, Adelino.  The only change (3 lines in bold have added) is: /** * Initialize the mapping metadata for the given class. * `@param` mappedClass the mapped class.   */   protected void initialize(Class mappedClass) {   this.mappedClass = mappedClass;   this.mappedFields = new HashMap();   PropertyDescriptor[] pds = BeanUtils.getPropertyDescriptors(mappedClass);   for (int i = 0; i < pds.length; i++) {   PropertyDescriptor pd = pds[i];   if (pd.getWriteMethod() != null) {   this.mappedFields.put(pd.getName().toLowerCase(), pd);   String underscoredName = underscoreName(pd.getName());   if (!pd.getName().toLowerCase().equals(underscoredName)) {   this.mappedFields.put(underscoredName, pd);   }   String underscoredNameSuffixed = underscoredName + ""_"";   if (!pd.getName().toLowerCase().equals(underscoredNameSuffixed)) {   this.mappedFields.put(underscoredNameSuffixed, pd);   }   }   }   }  I hope this small enhancement will be added.

For example, with this query:  SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = :baz::timestamp;  Note the ""::timestamp"" is attempting to cast the 'baz' parameter (presumably an integer type) to the Postgresql timestamp type.  The likely correct solution for this would be for the parameter matching to not match on :: (two colons).  Albeit, this is a relatively easy to work around issue, because one can always use the traditional question mark syntax and not named parameters, like:  SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE baz = ?::timestamp;  However, for large queries, it's convenient to use named parameters and sometimes a type cast is needed for complex or custom Postgresql data types.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5 final","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-03-21T18:06:47Z","2012-06-19T03:47:45Z"

Anyone wanting to set the classloader seems to have no alternative but to override the setter on classes like TransactionProxyFactoryBean in order to force the classloader to be set to what they want and not allow the initializeBean method to change it.  The initializaion method is this one in org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.java protected Object initializeBean(String beanName, Object bean, RootBeanDefinition mbd) { if (bean instanceof BeanNameAware) { ((BeanNameAware) bean).setBeanName(beanName); }      	if (bean instanceof BeanClassLoaderAware) {     		((BeanClassLoaderAware) bean).setBeanClassLoader(getBeanClassLoader());     	}          	if (bean instanceof BeanFactoryAware) {     		((BeanFactoryAware) bean).setBeanFactory(this);     	}  I am guessing the desired behavior here is probably to allow the value that is set via the setter to remain but allow the initializeBean method to change it if it was not set but I am not sure if this would cause a problem with other code that expects the current behavior. If the current behavior is correct then there might need to be some extra documentation or perhaps a change in the visiblity of the setter. Also, if the current behvaior remains then it would be nice to have a class which would allow the setting of the classloader for proxying.   ---  **Affects:** 2.0.6","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-05-04T08:44:53Z","2012-06-19T03:47:25Z"

With the definition done as above, security gets applied correctly, but the ApplicationListener.onApplicationEvent callback fails to ever get invoked.  If I comment out the intercept-methods decorator, the callback works again.  If I delete the intercept-methods decorator and replace it with a stand-alone global-method-security element, I'm in good shape with both security and the onApplicationEvent callback:                      ---  **Affects:** 3.0 M4  **Issue Links:** - #19349 Inner bean behind BeanFactoryPostProcessor should be able to receive application events  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/0e1b04d0829caa3a64ccab655c971312491f46ba","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2008-09-24T13:53:25Z","2019-01-11T14:22:28Z"
"","9726","CachedMessageProducer does not use the Message's priority, TTL, or delivery mode [SPR-5051]","**[Aaron Baff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=drizzt321)** opened **[SPR-5051](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-5051?redirect=false)** and commented  I have been using the CachedMessageProducer with ActiveMQ via JmsTemplate to send JMS Messages. I have recently tried to implement a priority based scheme, and since JMS offers this in the spec (via setJMSPriority() on a Message object), I would use this functionality. Unfortunately, I discovered that if I set the priority via Message.setJMSPriority(), it does not send that Message with the priority I set on it. Instead, the CachedMessageProducer either is given the priority by the JmsTemplate if it has been administratively set, or it uses the defaults that are received taken from the MessageProducer that is passed in when the CachedMessageProducer is instantiated.  I can understand JmsTemplate overriding the Message's values if desired, but if I set a priority (or TTL/delivery mode) on the Message I feel that I should be able to assume that the producer will use those values to send the Message to the broker. Perhaps I am mistaken about how this should work, but this behavior is not mentioned at all in the documentation (including JavaDoc), and I had to trace it down via debugging my application to figure out why my Message's weren't being sent with the correct priority.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.4","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2008-07-31T02:40:29Z","2019-01-12T16:28:04Z"
