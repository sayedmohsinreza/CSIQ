"","37","Small memory fixes","We analysed the memory usage of our application and found a lot of empty LinkedHashSet/Collections.synchronizedSet in the following three cases: - org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.InjectionMetadata.injectedElements - org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.LifecycleMetadata.initMethods - org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.LifecycleMetadata.destroyMethods  This fix should address this issue by: 1. Creating a LinkedHashSet of the ""right"" size, eg. the default capacity is 16 but we know the exact capacity that we need in advance 2. If the argument is empty then we use Collections.emptySet() which is a constant so no additional memory is used. Since it's immutable we also save ourselves the Collections.synchronizedSet wrapper.  Should I additionally open an issue?","closed","","marschall","2012-02-13T18:29:25Z","2014-06-27T17:47:38Z"
"","30","Validation","This pull request is in response to this Jira issue: https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-4774. It enables the kind of Validator class shown in the example in the last comment on the issue.   This code works great in a modified version of the PetClinic app I am using to test, by setting this AnnotationMethodValidator as the one system-level validator (i.e. by returning an object of this type from the getValidator() method of a config class that extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter).  If an approach to validation like this one makes sense, then the next question is how to register this validation mechanism with the framework. In my opinion, registering both a LocalValidatorFactoryBean and an AnnotationMethodValidator by default would cover most validation needs in an application, reduce the need to configure custom validators in ConfigurableWebBindingInitializers or @InitBinder methods, and bring validation more in line with other parts of the framework that leverage component scanning and flexible method signatures to make it easier for developers to extend the framework.   Unfortunately, the concept of a single validator class goes pretty deep into the framework (through the Java Config extension points to the DataBinder). It seems like it would be much more flexible for an app to be able to register multiple validators, similar to just about every other extension point (formatters, message converters, argument resolvers, handler exception resolvers, view resolvers, resource handlers, etc...). I have started to make all the changes to support registering a set of validators and defaulting, but I would like to get guidance and advice that this is the right approach before continuing.","closed","","scottfrederick","2012-02-08T04:26:05Z","2014-06-13T22:42:33Z"

"","43","Add support for creating test contexts with parent context","Hello,  I created ""@ParentContextConfiguration"" to support parent test contexts in spring-test framework.  Sample:  ``` java   @ParentContextConfiguration(""parent-context.xml"")   @ContextConfiguration(""child-context.xml"")   @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)   public class SomeTests {        @Autowired       protected ApplicationContext applicationContext;        // applicationContext.getParent() returns the parent app context   } ```  Parent context will be shared across the test classes if they are annotated to use parent context and have same configurations(xml locations, configuration classes, etc). It uses existing context caching  mechanism. I also added ""parent"" attribute to @DirtiesContext annotation in order to close the parent context if required. When ""parent=true"" is set on @DirtiesContext, DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener will close the parent application context as well as child contexts using the specified parent context.  Changes: - created @ParentContextConfiguration to configure the parent application context. - reused the @ContextConfigurationAttributes to represent both  @ContextConfiguration and @ParentContextConfiguration - changed ContextLoader SPI to pass a parent ApplicationContext - refactored ContextLoaderUtils to use ""getConfigurationAttributes()"" to resolve the context loader class and configuration attribute in a similar manner. - created ContextCacheKey class which contains two MergedContextConfiguration (one for parent, one for child) as a key of ContextCache. - added ""parent"" attribute on @DirtiesContext - @DirtiesContext(parent=true) will remove parent app context and all child app contexts using that parent context from the cache - unit tests  Issue: [SPR-5613](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5613)    Submitted the CLA   Thanks,","closed","","ttddyy","2012-02-29T01:39:05Z","2014-06-13T05:30:59Z"

"","2","Improve annotation processing thread-safety","Commit http://bit.ly/nXumTs ensured that component methods and fields marked with 'common annotations' such as @Resource, @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy are invoked/assigned once and only once, even if multiple instances of the CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor are processing the same bean factory.  The implementation works against the InjectionMetadata API, adding and removing these members from sets that track whether they are already 'externally managed', i.e. that another CABPP has already handled them, thus avoiding redundant processing.  Prior to this change, the #remove operations against these sets were not synchronized. In a single-threaded context this is fine thanks to logic in AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory#doCreateBean that checks to see whether a given bean definition has already been post processed. However, as reported by SPR-8598, certain cases involving multiple threads and annotated prototype-scoped beans can cause concurrent modification exceptions during the #remove operation (ostensibly because another thread is attempting to do the same removal at the same time, though this has yet to be reproduced in isolation).  Now the sets originally introduced by the commit above are decorated with Collections#synchronizedSet and any iterations over those sets are synchronized properly. This change should have low performance impact as such processing happens at container startup time (save for non-singleton lookups at runtime), and there should be little contention in any case.

"","14","Introduce (and Review) ScriptEvaluator abstraction","@costin, this PR supersedes your original one at #11 (I don't think it's possible for me to add commits to someone else's PR).  I'll close it right after sending this one.  Take a look at the ""Review"" commit 319d8566 to see what I've already updated.  A few open questions: 1. Is the 'arguments' parameter to Jsr233ScriptEvaluator#determineScriptEngine actually necessary?  It's not currently used in the implementation, and it's difficult to imagine a use case where a subclass would use arguments to determine which ScriptEngine to use.  Perhaps this is an oversight? 2. Can you explain the intention / necessity of the 'runAtStartup' setting in Jsr223ScriptEvaluatorFactoryBean?  getObject will be invoked when singletons are initialized anyway -- is it actually important have such an explicit setting to do this in the @PostConstruct method as well? 3. Can you explain a use case where EvaluationPolicy (formerly EvaluationType) would be anything other than ALWAYS?  A unit test here would be good.  I'm simply not familiar with the ""script modification"" semantics that are mentioned throughout.  It makes sense when imagining someone using a ScriptEvaluator directly, but against the FactoryBean, it doesn't (yet) make sense to me, unless perhaps the FactoryBean is non-singleton scoped. 4. Curiosity mostly, but what was the impetus for this change?  Why now? 5. Could you also add and assign to yourself an issue to add reference documentation for this feature?  @jhoeller, could you take a look at the cumulative set of changes for a sanity check, e.g. that this is appropriate for 3.1.1, etc?

"","13653","Improve the performance of BeanInfo lookups in CachedIntrospectionResults [SPR-9014]","**[Yuri Khomich](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=wilmot)** opened **[SPR-9014](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9014?redirect=false)** and commented  Current implementation of `org.springframework.beans.CachedIntrospectionResults` relies on `java.beans.Introspector` for bean introspection. Although `java.beans.Introspector` provides a way to limit the amount of information being introspected, `CachedIntrospectionResults` always uses `Introspector.getBeanInfo(beanClass)` which effectively means `Introspector.getBeanInfo(beanClass, Introspector.USE_ALL_BEANINFO)`:  ``` private CachedIntrospectionResults(Class beanClass) throws BeansException { 	try { 		if (logger.isTraceEnabled()) { 			logger.trace(""Getting BeanInfo for class ["" + beanClass.getName() + ""]""); 		} 		this.beanInfo = Introspector.getBeanInfo(beanClass); ```  The use of `USE_ALL_BEANINFO` flag makes `java.beans.Introspector` use class loading heavily to discover possible bean info. Extensive class loading is a real performance issue in some specific environments where classes are loaded not from local file system but from other sources that can be much slower to access.

I tried to use the `@Lazy` annotation to mark beans that are not to be instantiated unless realy used by the application. But this doesn't work currently.  More details: Spring's (org.springframework.beans.factory.support) DefaultListBeanFactory.doResolveDependency() internally calls findAutowireCandidates(). findAutowireCandidates() instantiates all candidate beans, but the determination whether there exists a primary candidate is done only later in doResolveDependency() - which is too late.

This makes it easy to write general purpose HTML, XML and JSON endpoints. I typically define for each subclass a class-level `@RequestMapping` specifying the base path for that controller (e.g., /applications, /packages, /farms, etc). Then the method-level `@RequestMappings` have value = """" for list views, value = ""/{id}"" for details views, etc.  For the web service list views, I would like to be able to map paths like /applications.xml, /applications.json, etc. But it doesn't seem that I can do this without giving up the generality in the approach above. I'd have to drop the class-level `@RequestMapping`, write a bunch of wrapper methods on each subclass, and then annotate them with explicit `@RequestMappings` to get the desired paths. Blech. Instead, I just define a generic `@RequestMapping` in the base controller like this:  `@RequestMapping`(value = """", method = RequestMethod.GET, params = ""format=json"") `@RequestMapping`(value = """", method = RequestMethod.GET, params = ""format=xml"")  That works, and it's generic, but I'd like to be able to use extensions instead, just because I think it's a little cleaner.  My proposal is that you add an extension element to the `@RequestMapping`. I envision it working something like this:  `@RequestMapping`(value = """", method = RequestMethod.GET, extension = ""json"") `@RequestMapping`(value = """", method = RequestMethod.GET, extension = ""xml"")  Thanks.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1.1  **Issue Links:** - #13057 Content negotiation improvements","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-22T23:02:55Z","2019-01-11T22:12:12Z"

Other times this implementation comes from org.apache.cxf.frontend.ClientProxyFactoryBean (or something similar) and is proxied (instantiated) directly in code.  The problem is, the caching proxies will only be created when the bean is spring managed.  We would like the ability to Proxy an instance with a caching proxy on the fly, in code.  For example:  ClientProxyFactoryBean clientFactory... CacheManager cacheManager... //lookup the CacheManager  FooService fs = (FooService) clientFactory.create(); fs = CachedProxy.createCacheProxy(fs, cacheManager); //creates a Proxy with the caching logic based on the Spring annotations on the interface  I created something to do just this which I'll attach to the jira.  One problem with my implementation is it uses package private Spring classes.  It would be nice if the spring provided a mechanism to do this.  If nothing else it would be good of some of the Spring caching code was opened up so that it could be accessed from other packages.  Please feel free to use any parts of the attached code if you want.  My code is based on milestone 2.

This could significantly reduce startup (and maybe shutdown) time by creating and initializing independent beans concurrently.  The algorithm is pretty simple in principle. Whereas the normal bean factory creates beans in single thread in rather random order, this implementation should:  1. Find all bean definitions that don't have any unresolved dependencies. 2. Schedule creation of each bean found in 1. in a separate concurrent task to allow parallel creation 3. When any of the tasks scheduled in 2. is completed go to 1.  The algorithm stops when all beans are created.

After a lot of debugging I tracked it down to one problem: There is this thread-bound map named resources in the TransactionSynchronizationManager. When the TransactionInterceptor first comes into play, it creates a Session and a SessionHolder and puts them into this map. The key is a proxy with the SessionFactoryImpl and the AnnotationSessionFactoryBuilder inside. Whenever getCurrentSession() is called on the injected SessionFactory in business code, there is a lookup for the SessionHolder object inside the resources map, but the key used for that is the plain SessionFactoryImpl object, not the proxy. So the SessionHolder cannot be found and a new Session and SessionHolder are created, although the existing should be used.

This is so because `EvalTag.java:136` creates a context without a root object while `InternalSpelExpressionParser.java:452` puts a fixed `false` for ""null-safeness"".

This usually doesn't cause any trouble, but if you have several currency formatters with different tasks in the system, you may experience conflicts (as I just did) each instance overwriting each other's settings. Also it may cause unexpected behaviour if other parts of your code access the static NumberFormat methods directly and expect them to be equipped with system defaults (or at least consistent settings over the entire runtime of the VM).  I recommend two things: 1: Introduce a call to `clone()` before you do any modifications. 2: The work done by the first line should be extracted into a separate method (like `protected NumberFormat getSystemNumberFormat(locale)`), so that it's easier to override just this part of the code.

If it turns out to be Jackson, of course, I'll file an issue with the appropriate folks.  I've encountered a problem with adding a `@ModelAttribute` to a controller's handler method. The intent of the method is to expose a bean that's been populated from a form or previous submission, but I can reproduce the issue without actually submitting data into the bean via a web interaction.  To get the simplest possible environment in which to reproduce, I'm using the Spring mvc-showcase sample. It's currently using Spring 3.1, but I first encountered, and am able to reproduce, this issue on my project's 3.0.5 setup. As you're probably aware, the mvc-showcase sample uses a pretty standard servlet-context.xml:  ```                                                                                          ```  ---  The default `controllers.xml` referenced in the file simply sets up the relevant component-scan and view-controller for the root path. The relevant snippet is below.  ```     ```  ---  The test bean which I am attempting to deliver is a dead-simple POJO.  ``` package org.springframework.samples.mvc.test;  public class TestBean {     private String testField = ""test@example.com"";      public String getTestField() {         return testField;     }      public void setTestField(String testField) {         this.testField = testField;     }  } ```  ---  And finally, the controller, which is also simple.  ``` package org.springframework.samples.mvc.test;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.ui.Model; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ModelAttribute; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;  @Controller @RequestMapping(""test/*"") public class TestController {      @ModelAttribute(""testBean"")     public TestBean getTestBean() {         return new TestBean();     }      @RequestMapping(value = ""beanOnly"", method = RequestMethod.POST)     public @ResponseBody     TestBean testBean(@ModelAttribute(""testBean"") TestBean bean) {         return bean;     }      @RequestMapping(value = ""withoutModel"", method = RequestMethod.POST)     public @ResponseBody     Model testWithoutModel(Model model) {         model.addAttribute(""result"", ""success"");         return model;     }      @RequestMapping(value = ""withModel"", method = RequestMethod.POST)     public @ResponseBody     Model testWithModel(Model model, @ModelAttribute(""testBean"") TestBean bean) {         bean.setTestField(""This is the new value of testField"");         model.addAttribute(""result"", ""success"");         return model;     }  } ```  ---  If I call the controller via the mapped path `/mvc-showcase/test/beanOnly`, I get a JSON representation of the bean, as expected. Calling the `withoutModel` handler delivers a JSON representation of the Spring `Model` object associated with the call. It includes the implicit `@ModelAttribute` from the initial declaration in the return value, but the bean is unavailable to the method. If I wish to process the results of a form submission, for example, and return a JSON response message, then I need that attribute.  The last method adds the `@ModelAttribute`, and this is where the trouble comes up. Calling `/mvc-showcase/test/withModel` causes an exception.  In my 3.0.5 installation, I get a JsonMappingException caused by a lack of serializer for FormattingConversionService. In the 3.1.0 sample, the exception is caused by lack of serializer for DefaultConversionService. I'll include the 3.1 exception here; it seems to have the same root cause, even if the path is a bit different.  ``` org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonMappingException: No serializer found for class org.springframework.format.support.DefaultFormattingConversionService and no properties discovered to create BeanSerializer (to avoid exception, disable SerializationConfig.Feature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS) ) (through reference chain: org.springframework.validation.support.BindingAwareModelMap[""org.springframework.validation.BindingResult.testBean""]->org.springframework.validation.BeanPropertyBindingResult[""propertyAccessor""]->org.springframework.beans.BeanWrapperImpl[""conversionService""])   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.StdSerializerProvider$1.failForEmpty(StdSerializerProvider.java:89)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.StdSerializerProvider$1.serialize(StdSerializerProvider.java:62)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.BeanPropertyWriter.serializeAsField(BeanPropertyWriter.java:272)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.BeanSerializer.serializeFields(BeanSerializer.java:175)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.BeanSerializer.serialize(BeanSerializer.java:147)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.BeanPropertyWriter.serializeAsField(BeanPropertyWriter.java:272)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.BeanSerializer.serializeFields(BeanSerializer.java:175)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.BeanSerializer.serialize(BeanSerializer.java:147)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.MapSerializer.serializeFields(MapSerializer.java:207)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.MapSerializer.serialize(MapSerializer.java:140)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.MapSerializer.serialize(MapSerializer.java:22)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.StdSerializerProvider._serializeValue(StdSerializerProvider.java:315)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ser.StdSerializerProvider.serializeValue(StdSerializerProvider.java:242)   at org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper.writeValue(ObjectMapper.java:1030)   at org.springframework.http.converter.json.MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter.writeInternal(MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter.java:153)   at org.springframework.http.converter.AbstractHttpMessageConverter.write(AbstractHttpMessageConverter.java:181)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.support.AbstractMessageConverterMethodProcessor.writeWithMessageConverters(AbstractMessageConverterMethodProcessor.java:121)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.support.AbstractMessageConverterMethodProcessor.writeWithMessageConverters(AbstractMessageConverterMethodProcessor.java:101)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.support.RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor.handleReturnValue(RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor.java:81)   at org.springframework.web.method.support.HandlerMethodReturnValueHandlerComposite.handleReturnValue(HandlerMethodReturnValueHandlerComposite.java:64)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.ServletInvocableHandlerMethod.invokeAndHandle(ServletInvocableHandlerMethod.java:114)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.RequestMappingHandlerMethodAdapter.invokeHandlerMethod(RequestMappingHandlerMethodAdapter.java:505)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.RequestMappingHandlerMethodAdapter.handleInternal(RequestMappingHandlerMethodAdapter.java:468)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.AbstractHandlerMethodAdapter.handle(AbstractHandlerMethodAdapter.java:80)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doDispatch(DispatcherServlet.java:790)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doService(DispatcherServlet.java:719)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:644)   at org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.doPost(FrameworkServlet.java:560)   at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:710)   at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:803)   at  ... ```  So, is there some configuration I am missing that should allow the Jackson converter to properly handle a response derived from a handler with `@ModelAttribute` in the method signature?  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2011-04-23T12:38:13Z","2019-01-13T07:09:39Z"
"","13797","@ResponseBody does not work with @ExceptionHandler when reason is set in @ResponseStatus [SPR-9159]","**[Tim Reidel](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=reideltj)** opened **[SPR-9159](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9159?redirect=false)** and commented  An IOException is thrown by Jetty when returning an object from an exception handler in my `@Controller` annotated class.  Some investigation revealed that the issue was seen only when I defined an error response in the `@ResponseStatus` annotation.  An example `@ExceptionHandler` that demonstrates the issue:  ```java @ExceptionHandler(TestException.class) @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, reason = ""test error"") public @ResponseBody TestObject handleTestException(TestException e) { 	return new TestObject(e.getMessage()); } ```  It seems the IOException is triggered by the HTTPConnection being written to twice in ServletInvocableHandlerMethod.invokeAndHandle() 1) in the call to setResponseStatus() in ServletInvocableHandlerMethod.invokeAndHandle() 2) in the call to returnValueHandlers.handleReturnValue()  If there is a reason defined in the `@ResponseStatus` then setResponseStatus() will write output text to the HTTP response which will cause the outputStream to close.   Later within returnValueHandlers.handleReturnValue() the JAXB seralization attempts to write to the outputStream which is closed.  This triggers the IOException.  Below is a snippet from ServletInvocableHandlerMethod that shows the logic that generates the error page via sendError().   This is only called when this.responseReason is non-null.  Thus if you define a reason in the `@ResponseStatus` annotation the `@ResponseBody` annotation won't work.  ```java private void setResponseStatus(ServletWebRequest webRequest) throws IOException {                if (this.responseStatus != null) {                        if (StringUtils.hasText(this.responseReason)) {                                webRequest.getResponse().sendError(this.responseStatus.value(), this.responseReason);                        }                        else {                                webRequest.getResponse().setStatus(this.responseStatus.value());                        }                        // to be picked up by the RedirectView                        webRequest.getRequest().setAttribute(View.RESPONSE_STATUS_ATTRIBUTE, this.responseStatus);                }        } ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.1.1  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/229537288a721ea1f73d7fee5ce9dd60ec46c23e, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/d52fc3bd2fb96de0f92e51782523ecd2b06646b0","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-23T20:08:59Z","2012-09-10T12:04:42Z"

In the following example:  ``` public class Parent {     public Object getSomething() {         // method injection         return null;     }      public void testMe() {         System.out.println(getSomething());     } } ```  ``` public class Child extends Parent { } ```  ``` public class ParentSomething {     public String toString() {         return ""parent"";     } } ```  ``` public class ChildSomething {     public String toString() {         return ""child"";     } } ```  ```xml                    ```  the result of **testMe** method called on **childService** bean is random: in Spring 2.0.2 and earlier childService **getSomething** method is called, ane in Spring 2.0.3 and later parentService **getSomething** method is called. This is caused by **MethodOverrides** class storing **MethodOveride** instances in HashSet (which doesn't guarantee any particular order of elements). In my opinion the most specific lookup-method (childService in the example above) should be used.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - #17969 Method lookup doesn't allow for overriding definitions in parent bean","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-19T03:15:23Z","2019-01-12T05:30:20Z"

In the process, I discovered a bug in the handling of transacted.  My use case is using Camel with spring-jms and spring-tx transactions.  Exceptions cause the JMS message to be retried by the configuration of my ConnectionFactory, when transactions are enabled.  Actual: When the broker is idle with no traffic, I'm seeing the following trace repeated until the session is in use again: Invoke: boolean javax.jms.Session.getTransacted([]) `@73850539` Invoke: void javax.jms.Session.commit([]) `@73850539` Invoke: void javax.jms.Session.commit([]) `@1538737979` Invoke: boolean javax.jms.Session.getTransacted([]) `@73850539` Invoke: void javax.jms.Session.commit([]) `@73850539` Invoke: void javax.jms.Session.commit([]) `@1538737979`  Expected: Session should not be getting errant commit messages when there is no outstanding messages being processed.  The problem is because the if statements in org.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactory.CachedSessionInvocationHandler.invoke(Object, Method, Object[]) give getTransacted the same behavior as the create* methods.   The call in org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer.commitIfNecessary(Session, Message) then calls getTransacted, marking the session as transactionOpen because it thinks a create* method was called.  fix: I believe the fix is to conditionalize `this.transactionOpen = true` only on a create method, or possibly also recover, since it appears the invoke is missing handling for getTransacted, getMessageListener/setMessageListener, getAcknoledgeMode, recover, and unsubscribe.  {code:title bean setup} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \                                                                        ``` ```  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - #13082 Concurrency problem in CachingConnectionFactory on closing Session (_**""supersedes""**_)","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-10T14:39:33Z","2019-01-11T13:37:38Z"

We are Spring Batch users and found the [ApplicationContextFactory](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/configuration/support/ApplicationContextFactory.html) and friends quite useful to us.  When creating either child application contexts or isolated ones in a Spring application, you might want to be able to retrieve a ""public"" service from that context using the id of the context so what we have is a manager that uses this interface to:  1. Create context with a configurable associated id based on the ApplicationContextFactory 2. Retrieve a service with the id of the context and the identify of a bean (either the type or the name of the bean for instance, as defined in that context) 3. Honor the application lifecycle events callbacks (i.e. close the context(s) when the application is being undeployed)  (Spring batch exposes all ""Job"" bean types in a registry. The idea would be to rationalize/standardize this in core)  What would be useful also is an infrastructure to load those contexts in parallel. This is a general remark that would apply to Spring Batch as well because loading an application with 100 job types can be slow since everything happens in a single thread.  We have built a very simple ""SpringConsole"" that exposes basic metadata about the beans and the context in which it is available. This is (namely) a JMX bean that an adminsitrator can query to spot configuration/deployment issues.  Extra useful insight:  1. Configuring a child application context to enable some features like Autowiring is not easy. It works pretty much out of the box but `@Autowired` with `@Qualifier` does not until you copy some config from the parent 2. Another nice feature we envision about this infrastructure is to create application contexts with ""private"" beans. There's no such dimension in Spring today as far as I know using XML configuration (private here means available from anywhere in the context but not exposed ""outside"") 3. This infrastructure is extremely useful when you want a configuration by template approach. For a particular feature you import the template and override/define only the bean(s) you want using standard bean Ids. This is impossible if you load your template in your main application context. We have implemented this to create ""batch skeletons"" in Spring batch and it works very well  If you need any more info or code, we're glad to contribute.    ---  4 votes, 3 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-03T23:25:57Z","2019-01-12T03:49:52Z"

[SPR-8477]","**[Steven Willems](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=steven.willems@i-develop.be)** opened **[SPR-8477](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8477?redirect=false)** and commented  Having multiple jars that can be included in multiple web apps, one could have to enable the cache from a module in web app A, but not in web app B. Now, when the code in the jar has a `@Cacheable`(value =""cacheName"") and the cacheName is not configured in the Spring context, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. This is always what you want.  E.g.  'X.jar' has a class somewhere with  `@Cacheable`(value=""cacheName"") public Data getData(Parameter p) { ... }  In the jar, a CacheManager is defined, with ""cacheName"" defined in ehcache.xml  \ \ \  Now, it can be useful to enable the cache in a web app that is only reading data using X.jar, but in an other webapp which is modifying data, the cache should not be enabled. This can be achieved be not including the 'cacheManager' from X.jar in a CompositeCacheManager. But doing so, now an exception will be thrown. This a real world situation I ran into today @ work.  To fix this, I suggest an extra parameter on the `@Cacheable` annotation, required() (default=false). So when required is true, an exception will still be thrown, otherwise a warning statement will be logged that the cache is not configured and the web app will invoke the getData method like there is no `@Cacheable` on that method.  Would be nice if this could be added to increase the flexibility for working with modules in different applications.

But the name generation is not customizable or extensible.  When adding an attribute of type Set\ to the model map, I'd like the generated name to be ""fooBarSet"" instead of ""fooBarList"". The ""Set"" suffix is preferred to the ""List"" suffix because it makes it clear the collection may be unordered. eg:      Set fooBarSet = new HashSet();     fooBarSet.add(new FooBar());     modelMap.addAttribute(fooBarSet);     assertTrue(modelMap.containsAttribute(""fooBarSet""));  When adding an attribute of type Map, I'd like the generated name to be ""fooBarMap"" instead of ""hashMap"". eg:      Map fooBarMap = new HashMap();     fooBarMap.put(""key"", new FooBar());     modelMap.addAttribute(fooBarMap);     assertTrue(modelMap.containsAttribute(""fooBarMap"");  In general, provide the ability to plug any name generation strategy into ModelMap (instead of the current hard coded conventions in org.springframework.core.Conventions). An existing example is how org.springframework.validation.MessageCodesResolver lets you customize the generation of message code names.  Permitting pluggable name generation strategies for ModelMap, and providing a few off-the-shelf implementations, would provide an efficient way to implement model map attribute naming conventions in a project.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-02T09:57:23Z","2015-09-22T18:20:31Z"

It is an error if `@Bean`(override=true) overrides nothing.  allowBeanDefinitionOverriding value is ignored when `@Bean`(override=true)  `@Bean`(override=true) works for context similarly to how `@Override` works for classes and interfaces.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #12637 Support profile exclusivity and/or bean definition finality (_**""duplicates""**_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-12T08:49:19Z","2019-01-11T13:19:54Z"

Compare to xmlconf:  ```  ```  I propose a static utility to help with instantiation of such constructor-dependency-injected beans:  ``` @Bean public MyService myService() {   return JavaConfHelper.newInstanceOfCurrent(); } ```  Spring could store current method info (return type and `@Bean` annotation) in some thread-local variable before invocation of myService() method, and then JavaConfHelper.newInstanceOfCurrent() could extract that information and instantiate MyService like in xmlconf.  (JavaConfHelper.newInstanceOfCurrent() will be valid only within `@Bean-annotated` method).   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M1","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-20T15:32:03Z","2019-01-11T13:23:51Z"

Only if the class has no interface, CGLIB is used.  When using Cobertura to measure code coverage, some instrumentation is applied to the beans. Especially, a marker interface is introduced. This changes the behavior of Spring AOP in the way, that in places, where CGLIB was used before, dynamic proxy is used.  The results are injection errors, since the proxy is not of appropriate type (... the type of the target class is required).  Looking for solutions, I found the following suggestions: - set proxy-target-class to true or - always use interfaces  However, in exisiting large projects, both of these solutions might imply a lot of changes and thus might not be applicable.  It would help, if there was a way to configure DefaultAopProxyFactory to not only ignore SpringProxy but also other interfaces (f.e. Cobertura marker interfaces) when making its CGLIB / dynamic proxy decision.  Currently, there is no easy way to to this. While it ist possible to configure the AopProxyFactory to be used in a ProxyFactory(Bean), there are many places in Spring code, where ProxyFactory is created by new() operator and there is no chance to set the AopProxyFactory.  Thus I would suggest - either a System Property to configure the interfaces to be ignored by DefaultAopProxyFactory - or a way to set a custom AopProxyFactory ""globally"" in the application context.  ---  **Issue Links:** - #8346 Add support for mixed, fine-grained JDK- and CGLIB-based proxying","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-26T01:27:57Z","2019-01-11T15:10:13Z"

The problem can be reproduced with a simple scenario: We have a package-visible base class for some services with an autowired dependency and a public getter and setter:  ``` abstract class AbstractService {      private Dependency dependency;      public Dependency getDependency() {         return dependency;     }      @Autowired     public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {         this.dependency = dependency;     } } ```  Then he have a public sub class that gets component-scanned:  ``` @Component public class Service extends AbstractService { } ```  Our test basically looks like this:  ``` @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = { ""/applicationContext.xml"" }) public class DependencyInjectionTest {      @Autowired     private Service underTest;      @Test     public void testDependencyInjected() {         // this test passes when Service.java was compiled with Java 5         // but fails when compiled with Java 6         assertNotNull(underTest.getDependency());     } } ```  with a very simple application context that just enables annotation-config and does a package scan (see the attachment for a complete Maven/Eclipse project).  When we compile the project with Java 5 the test passes when run with Java 5 or Java 6. But when we compile the project with Java 6 (""-source 1.5 -target 1.5"") the test fails both under Java 5 and Java 6.  After investigating the byte code in Service.class we noticed that two bridge methods are generated by the Java 6 compiler. These methods are not generated by the Java 5 compiler:  ``` public com.example.Dependency com.example.Service.getDependency() (bridge: true) public void com.example.Service.setDependency(com.example.Dependency) (bridge: true) ```  AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.buildAutowiringMetadata(Class clazz) uses ClassUtils.getMostSpecificMethod() in line 346 (current SVN) to determine if the method is defined in the class that is investigated (AbstractService in the example). The most specific method is the bridge method in Service.class when compiled with Java 6 but this method does not have the `@Autowired` annotation so the setter is never called.  A fix would be to replace ClassUtils.getMostSpecificMethod() with AopUtils.getMostSpecificMethod() to get the same results on Java 5 and Java 6. But this would cause a circular dependency between spring-aop and spring-beans and is probably not a high-performance solution.  We will change the visibility of AbstractService to public in our project to work around the problem. But I suggest to change Spring to deliver the same results on Java 5 and Java 6.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5, 3.1 M2  **Attachments:** - [DependencyTest.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18326/DependencyTest.zip) (_6.13 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #12555 Annotation based injection into non public base classes does not work (_**""duplicates""**_)","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-10T07:25:22Z","2019-01-12T16:48:49Z"

I am getting a ConcurrentModificationException exception in the Spring's InjectionMetadata class (located in the org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation package) when creating an instance of prototype bean in a multithreaded environment.  Here's the stack of the exception (only Spring portion of it):  ``` Thread [MaintenanceTasksJob] (Suspended (exception ConcurrentModificationException))                   LinkedHashMap$KeyIterator(LinkedHashMap$LinkedHashIterator).remove() line: 364 InjectionMetadata.checkConfigMembers(RootBeanDefinition) line: 72 AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.postProcessMergedBeanDefinition(RootBeanDefinition, Class, String) line: 216 DefaultListableBeanFactory(AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory).applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors(RootBeanDefinition, Class, String) line: 789 DefaultListableBeanFactory(AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory).doCreateBean(String, RootBeanDefinition, Object[]) line: 487 DefaultListableBeanFactory(AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory).createBean(String, RootBeanDefinition, Object[]) line: 450 DefaultListableBeanFactory(AbstractBeanFactory).doGetBean(String, Class, Object[], boolean) line: 309 DefaultListableBeanFactory(AbstractBeanFactory).getBean(String) line: 189 ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(AbstractApplicationContext).getBean(String) line: 1044 ```  I think I know what's going on here. The AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.doCreateBean() method (5th from the top of the stack) synchronizes on the bean definition object:  ``` synchronized (mbd.postProcessingLock) {   if (!mbd.postProcessed) {     applyMergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessors(mbd, beanType, beanName);     mbd.postProcessed = true;   } } ```  However, two methods later, in the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.postProcessMe rgedBeanDefinition(), an instance of the InjectionMetadata class for the bean is fetched based on the bean class and not bean definition object, which means that instances of InjectionMetadata are cached per bean class. Therefore despite the fact that two threads cannot enter the same post processing section for the same bean instance, they can enter it for the same bean class and therefore will share the same InjectionMetadata instance. Thus in the next method:  ``` public void checkConfigMembers(RootBeanDefinition beanDefinition) {   for (Iterator it = this.injectedElements.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {     if (!beanDefinition.isExternallyManagedConfigMember(member))       beanDefinition.registerExternallyManagedConfigMember(member);     } else {       it.remove();     }   } } ```  The it.remove() will potentially throw the exception.  To summarize the problem: when defining two or more prototype beans based on the same class in a multithreaded environment, a ConcurrentModificationException may be thrown in the InjectionMetadata class.  Am I right in my analysis?

While this is mostly a desired behavior, i.e. when using AOP in a single system where the business logic is hidden behind an interface, it creates a problem if the controller implements a utility interface, such as ApplicationContextAware, or is a Scala class (all scala classes automatically extend the ScalaObject trait, which translates into an interface at the bytecode level).  Specifically, the problem is in AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter#getMethodResolver, which calls ClassUtils.getUserClass(handler). This utility method does not check whether handler is a proxy. The solution should be simple - check for proxy and extract the target class, if needed.  Note that this prevents usage of Spring MVC Scala Controllers in an application where Spring AOP is also used, which is problematic to say the least.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-19T07:34:37Z","2019-01-13T21:42:49Z"

Due to cancelling state of the transaction, exception is rised in main process of transaction. 5. Spring catched this exception and invokes rollback to transaction. 6. Inside jboss transaction manager there is synchronized method for making transaction abort, so this rollback invocation is waiting another thread to complete. 7.

Issue #1: Since information provided does not match anything that's available on the backend (after all only ""id"" as content made to the controller) HTTP error with some JSON body (view) will be returned, but instead HTTP 500 being returned indicating that view can not be located. Is there a confusion that causes view not be located?  ``` javax.servlet.ServletException: Could not resolve view with name 'defaultView' in servlet with name 'mnsvc' org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.render(DispatcherServlet.java:1139) org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doDispatch(DispatcherServlet.java:927) org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doService(DispatcherServlet.java:827) org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.processRequest(FrameworkServlet.java:874) org.springframework.web.servlet.FrameworkServlet.doGet(FrameworkServlet.java:779) javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:621) javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:722) ```  Workaround (not acceptable): The behavior can be corrected to desired by adding trailing ""."" or ""/"", but certainly not the desired solution.  Next I have tried manipulating DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping considering there could be confusion in patterns to use.  ```xml       ```  Above does address the issue and now id = id.name:role, but again problem with the view. The same 500 error being returned. How can I address view related issue? If there is an issue using the right pattern (considering ""/users"" should be registered as ""/users.*"" and ""/users/"" too) I am assuming that it should be covered by introducing the DefaultAnnotationHandler Mapping and disabling useDefaultSuffixPattern, and based on my understanding it seems to me it is but (and filing as such).   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 RC2","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2011-12-12T18:57:55Z","2019-01-12T16:37:09Z"

Moving context:load-time-weaver before context:component-scan seemed to fix this, though it took me quite some time to track down the issue.

If an exception is thrown from the SessionImplementor within the SpringSessionSynchronization.afterCompletion(int status) method while rolling back due to an unrelated exception, it results in the SessionHolder never being marked as no longer synchronized with the transaction, which in turn results in the SessionHolder never being unbound from the thread.  This causes an IllegalStateException when attempting to use the session for the remainder of the request, and more importantly causes a IllegalTransactionStateException: Pre-bound JDBC Connection found! on every subsequent reuse of the thread until the platform/web container is restarted.  I have seen exceptions be thrown from SessionImplementor.afterTransactionCompletion(...) on line 229 and Session.clear() on line 243 on the SpringSessionSynchronization class, and either one causes the issue.  After considerable time spent reproducing the stack track so I could reliably reproduce the issue, I was able to isolate and fix the problem (or at least the symptoms I was fighting with).

However, if a custom `TestExecutionListener` is registered via `@TestExecutionListeners` then the defaults will **not** be registered. In most common testing scenarios, this effectively forces the user to manually declare all default listeners in addition to any custom listeners, for example:  ``` @TestExecutionListeners(   {     MyCustomTestExecutionListener.class,     ServletTestExecutionListener.class,     DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class,     DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class,     TransactionalTestExecutionListener.class   } ) ```  The problem with this approach is that it requires that the user know exactly which listeners are registered by default. Moreover, this set can change from release to release -- for example, `ServletTestExecutionListener` was added in release 3.2.  #### Proposal  Provide a mechanism for instructing the TestContext framework to register all default `TestExecutionListeners` in addition to an explicitly configured custom `TestExecutionListener`.  This could be achieved via a new boolean flag in `@TestExecutionListeners`. Alternatively, an enum could be introduced that specifies how defaults should be handled -- for example, prepended to custom listeners, appended to customer listeners, or excluded (i.e., the current behavior).  If this proposal is not implemented, it should at least be clearly documented in both Javadoc and the reference manual that the defaults are not prepended by default when specifying a custom `TestExecutionListener`.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0 GA  **Issue Links:** - [SEC-2587](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SEC-2587) Improvements in Spring Test (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #16699 Document support for merging custom TELs with default TELs in the reference manual (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #16092 Introduce mechanism for automatic discovery of default TestExecutionListeners  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/66250b1f8ec044b813e5ea8b96fbdf0af250f55c  2 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-17T02:33:01Z","2019-01-11T15:01:28Z"

However doing that involves pretty much replicating the entire code of ReflectiveMethodResolver (except where we get methods from type) and then since compareArguments and compareArgumentsVarargs methods on ReflectionHelper are not public and also ReflectiveMethodExecutor class is not public, we need to duplicate lot of code.  However if ReflectiveMethodResolver could call a protected method getMethods(type), a subclass could just override it and provide its own static methods.

As an aside, `invokeMethod(Object, String, Object...)` in `ReflectionTestUtils` could not be implemented using `ReflectionUtils` due to these limitations.  #### Deliverable  Either modify `ReflectionUtils.findMethod(Class, String, Class...)` or introduce a new method in `ReflectionUtils` to provide support for finding methods with _compatible_ argument lists, specifically:  1. for methods that accepts var-args    - for example, a call to `findMethod(clazz, ""add"", int.class, int.class, int.class)` should find a a method named ""add"" with a parameter declaration of `(int... args)`.    - of course, a call to `findMethod(clazz, ""add"", new int[] {int.class, int.class, int.class})` _will_ find the var-args method, but this requires specific knowledge of the implementation and therefore does not lend itself to dynamic, reflective use cases. 2. with regard to type conversion, either due automatic boxing and unboxing of primitives or due to inheritance.    - for example, a call to `findMethod(clazz, ""foo"", Integer.class)` should find a method named ""foo"" that accepts an `int`. For example, the following unit test should pass.  ``` public class Test {  	public void foo(int a) { 		System.out.println(""a = "" + a); 	}  	@Test 	public void testFoo() { 		Method method = ReflectionUtils.findMethod(getClass(), ""foo"", Integer.class); 		assertNotNull(method); 	} } ```  - similarly, a call to `findMethod(clazz, ""foo"", Integer.class)` should find a method named ""foo"" that accepts a `Number` if there is no ""foo"" method that accepts an `Integer`.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.6  **Attachments:** - [ReflectionUtils.java.patch](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18692/ReflectionUtils.java.patch) (_3.31 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #13275 Introduce a generic method for invoking any non-public method in ReflectionTestUtils  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/16fb3cb4b3fe6db341277889b20a2e4f774e2cc4, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/1a34f6459d0e49e4fd60aa3644ad17fa117854d9  2 votes, 3 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-26T14:47:47Z","2022-01-25T10:33:15Z"

If the supplied `Throwable` is a `JMSException`, it gets passed to `AbstractMessageListenerContainer`'s `invokeExceptionListener()` method for further processing. In turn, `invokeExceptionListener()` calls `onException()` on the JMS `ExceptionListener` that was registered with the `AbstractMessageListenerContainer`.  `AbstractMessageListenerContainer`'s `invokeExceptionListener()` method does **not** call `onException()` on the JMS `ExceptionListener` of the underlying JMS `Connection`.  Consequently, connection errors that occur while processing _inbound_ messages in a Spring MessageListenerContainer do not get propagated to the underlying connection. If the underlying connection is a shared connection that was created by Spring's `SingleConnectionFactory` or `CachingConnectionFactory`, that now broken connection will be reused by subsequent clients even though it should have been reset due to the connection failure. This leads to an endless loop of retries with invalid connections that will never work, and in the end the application will likely have to be restarted in order to obtain new connections.  ###### Goal  `AbstractMessageListenerContainer`'s `invokeExceptionListener()` method should call `onException()`:  - on the JMS `ExceptionListener` that was registered with the `AbstractMessageListenerContainer` (i.e., the status quo) - **and** on the JMS `ExceptionListener` of the underlying JMS `Connection`  Note that `DefaultMessageListenerContainer`'s `refreshDestination()` method already provides similar support for refreshing a possibly invalid destination name for a `CachingDestinationResolver`.  ###### Work-around  The current work-around is to set the `exceptionListener` property of the `DefaultMessageListenerContainer` to the `CachingConnectionFactory`. This works since `CachingConnectionFactory` implements the JMS `ExceptionListener` interface, and `CachingConnectionFactory`'s `onException()` method will internally reset the connection (i.e., clear the cache). Note, however, that the `exceptionListener` property is unfortunately not exposed as an attribute via the `` XML namespace. The following XML-based configuration has been tested as a suitable work-around configuration:  ```xml  	 	 	 	  ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?96821-DefaultMessageListenerContainer-CachingConnectionFactory-tomcat-and-WebSphere-MQ","open","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-14T14:57:23Z","2016-06-02T12:36:52Z"

There are of course alternatives to this, such as using load-time weaving with AspectJ proxies instead of JDK dynamic proxies.  Note that self-autowiring _by name_ via `@Resource` **is** permitted by the framework; whereas, self-autowiring _by type_ is **not** permitted by the framework as can be seen in the following code snippet from `DefaultListableBeanFactory`'s `findAutowireCandidates(String, Class, DependencyDescriptor)` method.  ```java for (String candidateName : candidateNames) {     if (!candidateName.equals(beanName) && isAutowireCandidate(candidateName, descriptor)) {         result.put(candidateName, getBean(candidateName));     } } ```  The name of the bean (i.e., the bean that's trying to autowire itself) is `beanName`. That bean is in fact an autowire candidate, but the above if-condition returns `false` (since `candidateName` equals the `beanName`). Thus you simply cannot autowire a bean with itself _by type_ (at least not as of Spring 3.1 M2).  #### Goal  Add support for self-autowiring using `@Autowired` on fields and methods.  #### Stack Overflow Discussion  This topic was brought to our attention via a discussion on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5152686/self-injection-with-spring).  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - #21186 Self autowiring does not work for transactional beans - #19532 Self reference fallback in 4.3 is not meant to apply to collection elements - #16794 `@Autowired` does not work for target bean of type Collection - #18973 Define and document rules for `@Autowired` self-injection in case of ambiguity  18 votes, 23 watchers","closed","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-13T09:03:19Z","2019-01-13T07:08:49Z"

It is not obvious to newbies that:  1. PropertyEditors can be used not only for explicit bean properties but also for XML namespace attributes 2. various *ArrayEditors are registered by default, thus supporting comma-separated lists of elements in a single property/attribute    - for example, ByteArrayPropertyEditor, CharArrayPropertyEditor, StringArrayPropertyEditor, ClassArrayEditor, ResourceArrayPropertyEditor, etc. 3. pattern matching can be used for all supported Resources  #### Current Default PropertyEditors  The PropertyEditors that are actually registered by default in a Spring ApplicationContext can be found in the code here:  - ResourceEditorRegistrar: registerCustomEditors(PropertyEditorRegistry) - PropertyEditorRegistrySupport: createDefaultEditors()  #### Goals  The following sections of the Reference Manual need to be updated with the current set of defaults and more examples of how to actually benefit from PropertyEditors in XML-based configuration. It would be beneficial to the reader to cross reference between these sections. Furthermore, table 5.2 (_Built-in PropertyEditors_) could be greatly improved by adding a new ""Registered by default"" column.  - [Built-in Resource Implementations](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/spring-framework-reference.html#resources-implementations) - [Resources as Dependencies](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/spring-framework-reference.html#resources-as-dependencies) - [Built-in PropertyEditor Implementations](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/spring-framework-reference.html#beans-beans-conversion)  ###### Concrete examples with context:property-placeholder  It would be helpful to provide examples of using PropertyEditors in conjunction with XML namespaces. I have often heard the question, ""How can I supply more than one location for property placeholder replacement using the context:property-placeholder namespace element?"" As of Spring 3.0.5, there are zero examples in the reference manual that use either a comma-separated list of locations or wildcards for pattern matching; all current examples supply a single property file as the location.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  1 votes, 3 watchers","open","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-01T13:48:53Z","2016-05-17T20:08:29Z"

Without declaring a specific `ContextLoader`, `GenericXmlContextLoader` will be used by default, which generates a default XML resource location.  With the introduction of `AnnotationConfigContextLoader` in Spring 3.1 M2, it would be nice if the TestContext framework supported a _look-up_ mechanism to determine which `ContextLoader` (from a list of candidates) should be used to generate default resource locations or configuration classes and eventually load the context.  #### Goals  Introduce a `DelegatingSmartContextLoader` that delegates to a _candidate_ `SmartContextLoader` list to determine which context loader is able to generate default resource locations or configuration classes for a given test class. The _winning_ candidate should then be used to actually load the context.  #### Implementation Notes  By default, `DelegatingSmartContextLoader` should delegate to `GenericXmlContextLoader` and `AnnotationConfigContextLoader`, in that order. `GenericPropertiesContextLoader` will not be included by default.  Furthermore, the new `SmartContextLoader` SPI will have to provide support to query a `SmartContextLoader` to determine if the context loader is capable of generating default resource locations or configuration classes. Implementations must _preemptively_ determine if the generated default(s) actually exists.  Depending on time and complexity, the implementation may or may not be generic in terms of whether it knows explicitly about only `GenericXmlContextLoader` and `AnnotationConfigContextLoader` or whether it supports any number of configured `SmartContextLoader` candidates.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #13033 Introduce SmartContextLoader SPI (_**""depends on""**_) - #13185 Document DelegatingSmartContextLoader (_**""is depended on by""**_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/72da569aa3c84ade51cac8af84e0206f644746b6, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/9a40021f18bc0493c247d5fe29b05d5d76a9c05a, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/a298c2dde80d08c0ad02495d9e53f6d58650efa4, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/d0cd678089b8956e95f34cef06fec3a1621c1677, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/461119973ba370e4e6a6d4be8668adf0f2dd6832, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/21f3f59cb71fb94443415ca8be1e215c8290a86a, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/f874ed9790d1eb1621c097fbd9954ec1013f4290, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e7298a88d6034d6534f80b516ec793ea14e4b0cb, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e34fa6abb1e114a7d7cd6a77ca5098037c3fd403, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/b8624b470c3514ef0ee95ff26eeffb40a26ddce2, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/d2e6f82aa304040a9a00e3b71179cc737634fe6a, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/12eb9d7ed63f6864a485ec3b7c2abc2bba1a19cc, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/8e497d96277d38994e257cef7671844ef95acc3c, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/4aed64ea4b8c5e4a16312edb60d3b016a97c4bf8, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/4cbe2ae00aaec2ca4074b06f389f5e50ca235da3, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/19fc2004f5ada9e52fde8e88f814dae52e95f898, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/4ef895a018451cb4d9398fe5bc6104431b9dd5da, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/b49d11f84a5d70961778749c82c638ba6c7d8244","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-01T08:44:22Z","2019-01-11T13:22:47Z"

[x] Introduce a new `SmartContextLoader` SPI that extends `ContextLoader` and supports both String[] and Class[] resources, likely retrieved from a new ""context"" parameter object as opposed to hard-coded, inflexible method signatures. This will replace the need for `ResourceTypeAwareContextLoader` and its `ResourceType` enum, and it will result in a more flexible SPI that is better suited to support future, unknown requirements. 2. [x] Refactor existing `AnnotationConfigContextLoader`, `ContextLoaderUtils`, and `TestContext` implementations to take advantage of the `SmartContextLoader` SPI 3. [x] Delete `ResourceTypeAwareContextLoader` 4. [x] Delete `ContextLoaderUtils.LocationsResolver` and implementations  #### Implementation Notes Regarding Profiles  Design the `SmartContextLoader` SPI so that a reference to the configured active profiles can be passed to a variant of `loadContext()`. This _reference_ may potentially take the form of the ""context"" parameter object introduced with the new `SmartContextLoader` SPI. See `AbstractGenericContextLoader`'s `loadContext()` method for an example of where the profiles would need to be set in the code (i.e., prior to refreshing the context).  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #10852 Provide TestContext support for `@Configuration` classes (_**""depends on""**_) - #12615 TestContext framework should support declarative configuration of bean definition profiles (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #13034 Introduce a DelegatingSmartContextLoader (_**""is depended on by""**_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-01T08:27:46Z","2019-01-13T07:09:09Z"

Providing access to the `TestContext` would allow programmatic access to `TestContext` properties as well as methods such as `markApplicationContextDirty()`.  #### Considerations  Instead of exposing the `TestContext` _as is_, it may be preferential to expose a new (yet-to-be-implemented) public-facing interface that defines a subset of the publicly available methods in `TestContext`.

I'm trying to send custom http headers when invoking RestTemplate methods using features in #10535 & #12152.  I configured an InterceptingClientHttpRequestFactory to use an interceptor that adds a header prior to execution. However, I've discovered that my header is not sent when the SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory bufferRequestBody property is false. I've also tried adding the header by setting an interceptor directly on the RestTemplate instead of via request factory but with the same result.  I've only been able to send the custom header by setting the SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory bufferRequestBody property back to its default of true. I need to avoid buffering due to bug #12564. Is this expected behavior? Are any workarounds available?

We noticed, that autowiring(in core application jar classes) failed at the application startup and we see errors as given in the logs files attached herewith.  Following are the observations:  1. Autowiring works fine, if all the jars loaded at application level, are moved to individual wars(WEB-INF/lib). 2. Autowiring works fine, if the classes in the core application jars have public accessors, which is default for security and encapsulation purposes.

Sometimes however it is helpful to render the same Tiles definition without the layout, for example during an Ajax request.  A few scenarios this simple approach can serve: 1.

Now while it may be convenient to be able to choose a provider by protocol it should also be possible to re-use the protocol which is defined in the mail session. My proposal is to use null or an empty protocol property in this case:  ```java protected Transport getTransport(Session session) throws NoSuchProviderException {   String p = getProtocol();   return (p == null || p.length() ==0) ? session.getTransport() : session.getTransport(p); } ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-30T08:26:34Z","2012-06-19T03:39:38Z"

Example:  ```java @RequestMapping(""/test"") @ResponseBody public List requester(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,          Locale locale, @RequestBody Object bodyData) {     if (bodyData instanceof Map){         processMap((Map)bodyData);     }     if (bodyData instanceof Collection){          processCollection((Collection)bodyData);     } } ```  I've traced the problem to the following line in the getMethodArgumentValues method in the org.springframework.web.method.support.InvocableHandlerMethod class.  ```java args[i] = resolveProvidedArgument(parameter, providedArgs); if (args[i] != null) {    continue; } ```  I believe the code below may fix the issue by not doing a parameter type matching if the parameter is of Type Object since no providedArg would actually be only of type Object and therefore should not match.  This change would be in the InvocableHandlerMethod class.  ```java private Object resolveProvidedArgument(MethodParameter parameter, Object... providedArgs) { 	if (providedArgs == null || parameter.getParameterType() == Object.class) { 		return null; 	} 	for (Object providedArg : providedArgs) { 		if (parameter.getParameterType().isInstance(providedArg)) { 			return providedArg; 		} 	} 	return null; } ```  Because the parameter is of type Object it matches any providedArgs and the one that's provided in this case is the SimpleSessionStatus object.  Note I have not had time to test this change at all.  There is a workaround in that you can change it to a String parameter and perform the conversion manually in your servlet.  Note the reason I need to do this instead of specifying a different Servlet for Map vs Collection, is that the js library that is accessing this servlet uses a single URL to send either a single json object or a list of json objects if there are multiple objects to send.  In the case of the single json it resolves to a Map of name value pairs, and in the case of the list it resolves to a List of Maps of name value pairs.    ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA","closed","in: web,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-27T06:49:23Z","2019-01-11T22:23:15Z"

However, using the default converters included with the 3.0.6 version of org.springframework.format.support.FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean we find that this Map is being shallow copied before being injected into our objects and is, hence, not initialised.  Please see the following test case that replicates this issue:  https://github.com/rgladwell/spring-map-converter-issue  For some reason the MapToMapConverter is copying this Map despite the fact we don't want any conversions carried out on it.

Now this works as expected, if programmatically set (beanDefinition.setAttribute(                    RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.SKIP_REQUIRED_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE, Boolean.TRUE)), but there is no way that we can do this by specifying a meta element for the desired bean definition.  e.g \  \ \  does not work, however it is expected to.  I am not sure this is by design, but beanFactory.getBeanDefinition(beanName).getAttribute(SKIP_REQUIRED_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE) in method protected boolean shouldSkip(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory, String beanName) in RequiredAnnotaionBeanPostProcessor returns a string value (as expected from any attribute value) and this comes out to be ""true"" for the example above.  Shouldn't there be a boolean conversion for this attribute value? like Boolean.valueOf(xxxx)  So if the method protected boolean shouldSkip(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory, String beanName) { return (beanFactory != null && beanFactory.containsBeanDefinition(beanName) && Boolean.TRUE.equals(beanFactory.getBeanDefinition(beanName).getAttribute(SKIP_REQUIRED_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE))); }  is modified as protected boolean shouldSkip(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory, String beanName) { return (beanFactory != null && beanFactory.containsBeanDefinition(beanName) && Boolean.TRUE.equals(Boolean.valueOf(beanFactory.getBeanDefinition(beanName).getAttribute(SKIP_REQUIRED_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE)))); }  The meta value will be usable.  This may not be a critical thing but it definitely adds unnecessary elements to an application. The only way, currently, to skip this check is to create a BeanPostProcessor that takes an input (a list of bean names that need to skip the required check) and manually(programmatically) sets the desired SKIP_REQUIRED_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE to false for the desired beans.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.2  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7ee821d3d153c7d528cc29b2ebf295c3877a5dff, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/f6be50eda24dc4811a6f9024b8134e33c5e99a17, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/19c6a4e209d2552f1213095bfaec67f78dbf0c07","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-15T13:52:56Z","2012-06-19T03:39:50Z"

DataNucleus throws a JDOUserException because the transaction is still active (the exception is logged at DEBUG level and otherwise ignored).  JDO specification 3.0 mrel3 (and earlier) says:  > In a non-managed environment, if the current transaction is active, close throws JDOUserException.  (http://db.apache.org/jdo/specifications.html)  I propose a patch (attached) that: 1. defers the close() call until TransactionSynchronization.afterCompletion, and 2. logs failed close() attempt at WARN level, since it can lead to serious resource leakage.

[SPR-8794]","**[pas filip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=pasfilip)** opened **[SPR-8794](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8794?redirect=false)** and commented  Hi, I was wondering why spring's task executor didn't also extend from java.util.ExecutorService and if it could be added? The only reason I could think of is that it has grown as such historically or perhaps that there is a backwards compatible issue somewhere or perhaps it was chosen because the shutdown methods didn't want to be exposed? Not sure why and maybe this has already been discussed internally or on mailing lists etc although I didn't find anything related to this topic after a brief search. I apologize in advance if it's an outdated discussion. It looks like it shouldn't be too difficult to implement this in most TaskExecutor implementations and it would be a useful extension if you want to inject an ExecutorService in a managed bean making use of the invokeAll, invokeAny methods regardless of the underlying infrastructure being managed or unmanaged. The motivation I have for wanting an ExecutorService is that it isn't DRY code to achieve the semantics provided by invokeAll or invokeAny using the Async annotation or the TaskExecutor. The drill is to create the Callable or Runnable and submit them or invoke the async methods, collect the futures and iterate over them to retrieve the results.(could use static methods to be DRY but still not ideal) It would be nice to be able to inject the ExecutorService into your bean and just invoke invokeAll for the situations where a bunch of jobs need to run and all return while using the same pool underneath for this as used for the Async annotation. Nothing actually prevents me from doing this it just means I can't use the nice task namespace to keep the xml configuration short. If the TaskExecutor would extend ExecutorService I could use the task namespace and inject a ExecutorService into any managed by without needing to update the xml config. (All I would need to add is a Qualifier or custom Annotation for discriminating with the scheduler pool should there be one) It would also mean I could use the WorkManager implementation without having to write an adapter to provide the invokeAll and invokeAny semantics. Alternatively I could retrieve the ExecutorService that some of spring's TaskExecutor implementations contain and expose it as a bean but it would mean I couldn't switch easily to using alternate implementations of TaskExecutor that don't contain a wrapped ExecutorService.  In summary I'd say it would be a nice addition which provides a useful service while keeping configuration changes to a minimum and providing more DRY code.    ---  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2011-10-20T16:08:59Z","2019-01-12T02:37:03Z"

A workaround is to manually add the relevant BeanPostProcessors (like AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor and CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor) to BeanFactory.  Same thing happens in web app when I use ContextLoaderInitializer to load `@Configuration` classes or define them through XML config. My particular case is that I use MyBatis-Spring integration and I cannot declare a `@Bean` of type org.mybatis.spring.mapper.MapperScannerConfigurer using annotation config, because this bean is a BeanFactoryPostProcessor and thus breaks autowiring of `@Configuration` class.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M1  **Attachments:** - [org.mybatis.spring.sample.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19013/org.mybatis.spring.sample.zip) (_8.37 kB_) - [testcase.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18060/testcase.zip) (_1.98 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #12905 `@PostConstruct` and PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer do not work together in AnnotationConfigApplicationContext (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #12525 BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor registered via `@Bean` will not be invoked - #14099 Method postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry is not called if the bean implements BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor - #18808 Warn about non-static BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor declarations on `@Configuration` classes  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/52bef0b7b024e794186437dee78945fbb5bd209a","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-04-22T01:10:15Z","2019-01-13T07:09:41Z"

Previously during the migration, any bad migration will safely failed against any invocation with the well known exception :  ```java No adapter for endpoint YYY. Is your endpoint annotated with @Endpoint, or does it implement ... ```  But let say that the result of the migration, the endpoint looks like :  ```java public void saveTheWorld(@RequestPayload JAXBElement request) {} ```  It should failed because org.yourOwnPojo.Person is not a jaxb one. This tests below show that it will not fail.  ```java  package org.springframework.ws.server.endpoint.adapter.method.jaxb;  import java.lang.reflect.Method;  import javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement;  import org.junit.Assert; import org.junit.Test; import org.springframework.core.MethodParameter; import org.springframework.ws.server.endpoint.annotation.RequestPayload; /**  *   * @author elmandour omar  */ public class TestProcessor { 	 	@Test 	public void testShouldNotSupportTheRequestPayload(){ 		JaxbElementPayloadMethodProcessor processor = new JaxbElementPayloadMethodProcessor(); 		Method mymethod = SupermanEndPoint.class.getMethods()[0]; 		Assert.assertTrue(processor.supportsRequestPayloadParameter(new MethodParameter(mymethod,0))); 	} }   class SupermanEndPoint {     public void saveTheWorld(@RequestPayload JAXBElement request) {}   }    class NotAJaxbObject{} ```  The marshalling will works fine and the request object is created but with null or default values (int..)  You might wonder how can someone confuse his own pojo object with a jaxb one ? Like me by having typically the same name, for the jaxb and your pojo object.  Maybe the supportsRequestPayloadParameter should test that the embedded object is a real jaxb one (with `@XmlType` annotation from the package javax.xml.bind.annotation ?)

Example:  **core-beans.xml:**  ```                                   classpath:/spring/core/core-beans.properties         classpath:/spring/override/test-beans.properties                         ...     ```  **first-plugin-beans.xml:**  ```                                                    ....  ```  **second-plugin-beans.xml:**  ```                                           ....  ```  **MyComponent.java:**  ``` package my.first.plugin;  @Component public class MyComponent {    @Value(""${myValue}"")   private String myStringValue;      ... } ```  The problem is, that the AbstractBeanFactory tries to resolve a `@Value` property with every value resolver (here the three PropertyPlaceholderConfigurers).  Extract from AbstractBeanFactory:  ``` public String resolveEmbeddedValue(String value) {   String result = value;   for (StringValueResolver resolver : this.embeddedValueResolvers) {     result = resolver.resolveStringValue(result);   }   return result; } ```  If an embeddedValueResolver resolves the value to NULL, then the next embeddedValueResolver tries to resolve NULL, which leads finally to execution of the PropertyPlaceholderHelper and an assetion failure.  Extract from PropertyPlaceholderHelper:  ``` public String replacePlaceholders(String value, PlaceholderResolver placeholderResolver) {   Assert.notNull(value, ""Argument 'value' must not be null."");   return parseStringValue(value, placeholderResolver, new HashSet()); } ```  I think a fix should be to stop the resolving chain, if an embeddedValueResolver resolves the value to NULL. (There is no more resolving possible!)  **Possible Fix:**  Extract from AbstractBeanFactory:  ``` public String resolveEmbeddedValue(String value) {   String result = value;   for (StringValueResolver resolver : this.embeddedValueResolvers) {     result = resolver.resolveStringValue(result); 	if (result == null) { 	  // No more resolving possible 	  break; 	}   }   return result; } ```    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?112540-No-Null-Value-with-Value-and-PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer-possible  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/f3ff98d86275e19e6828f9c3a0c432de0587bbbe","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-28T02:43:44Z","2013-01-23T11:08:58Z"

Here's what I could find out so far. The [test case](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-beans/src/test/java/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/Spr8954Tests.java) actually only succeeds as it starts with retrieving the relevant beans by name, which causes them to be instantiated in the first place. Thus the following happens in `AbstractBeanFactory.isTypeMatch(...)`:  - we get in there trying to resolve a factory de-reference ""&foo"" - we access the factory instance by calling `getSingleton(...)` passing in `false` for singleton creation but get back the bean instance as it's already created - we run into the `....isAssignableFrom(...)` check and get the bean returned  Now consider the case when the `FactoryBean` is not yet created:  - we get in there trying to resolve a factory de-reference ""&foo"" - we access the factory instance by calling `getSingleton(...)` passing in `false` for singleton creation **and get back `null`** - the subsequent evaluation looks at the `BeanDefinition` but only evaluates the predicted bean type in turn but not the bean class of the actual `BeanDefinition` - we fail to match the type  The code is trying to access a decorated definition (line 501, `AbstractBeanDefinition`) which I couldn't make much sense of. For ordinary bean definitions that doesn't seem to exist which lets the execution run into line 510. But either way the bean definitions class should be checked.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1.1  **Issue Links:** - [DATACMNS-133](https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATACMNS-133) Documented Configuration of Conversion Service with DomainClassConverter Does Not Work (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #15148 Lookup of beans of type fails for factory beans if type prediction is used. - #13782 Check original beanClass in #isFactoryBean calls for `@Bean` methods as well - #13594 BeanFactory does not return FactoryBeans in case the are looked up by type and type prediction is used  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/b3c9a11bd1141f644859eb0023f4d6f4ae0c9910","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-28T06:46:17Z","2019-01-13T07:06:01Z"

However, when reading properties using `BeanWrapperImpl` one will always get the value returned as is. Now assume we want to access the bean values in a given type (e.g. `String`). One would need to do the follwoing:  ```java ConversionService service = // ... BeanWrapper wrapper = new BeanWrapperImpl();  Object rawValue = wrapper.getPropertyValue(""foo""); String value = conversionService.convert(rawValue, String.class); ```  As the `ConversionService` being used is likely to be the one already in place inside `BeanWrapperImpl` it would be cool if the code above could be abbreviated to:  ```java BeanWrapper wrapper = new BeanWrapperImpl(); String value = wrapper.getPropertyValue(""foo"", String.class); ```    --- No further details from [SPR-9105](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9105?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-10T02:10:42Z","2018-12-27T12:16:21Z"

However, parsing the parameter map should happen if the request is **not** a form submittal. In Spring 3.0.5 `getBody()` always invokes `this.servletRequest.getInputStream()` (which works in my code). Now, using Spring 3.0.6, my controller method parameter `@RequestBody MultiValueMap parameters` is always empty, which is because `getFormBody()` will be called instead.

We met a problem when using EjbContext.setRollbackOnly() within a ejb called by a transactional business service. EjbContext.setRollbackOnly() set the jta transaction status as STATUS_MARKED_AS_ROLLBACK. The EJB Service returns without error but set the JTA Transaction rollback only via EJBContext. When back to Spring, TransactionInterceptor call commit on PlatformTransactionManager (JtaTransactionManager). The commit method then throw an UnexceptedRollbackException (Indeed JBoss [EAP 4.2.3] throw a RollbackException when Spring try to commit).  When looking at JtaTransactionManager, we notice that the doCommit method checks the status of the jta transaction but only for STATUS_NO_TRANSACTION and STATUS_ROLLBACK and not for STATUS_MARKED_AS_ROLLBACK.  We fix the problem by decorating the JtaTransactionManager and propagating the rollback to spring in the commit method if the jta transaction status is equals to STATUS_MARKED_AS_ROLLBACK.

I know that I can use substitution mechanism brought by build tools such as Maven or Ant. However the ability of Log4jWebConfigurer to manage several locations would avoid to have environment specific .war file.  For example in Dev environment on my local machine, I like to have the SQL queries log to the database but I don't want such log in Production. In such case, I would like to specify something like that in the web.xml :  ```       log4jConfigLocation      file:${catalina.base}/files/conf/log4j.xml,classpath:log4j.xml        org.springframework.web.util.Log4jWebConfigurer  ```  The file:${catalina.base}/files/conf/log4j.xml is taken into account if it exists, otherwise the nect log4j config file location is tried.  Thus, I would like to propose the following modification in org.springframework.web.util.Log4jWebConfigurer :  ```  	/** 	 * Initialize log4j, including setting the web app root system property. 	 *  	 * @param servletContext 	 *            the current ServletContext 	 * @see WebUtils#setWebAppRootSystemProperty 	 */ 	public static void initLogging(ServletContext servletContext) { 		// Expose the web app root system property. 		if (exposeWebAppRoot(servletContext)) { 			WebUtils.setWebAppRootSystemProperty(servletContext); 		}  		// Only perform custom log4j initialization in case of a config file.

The reason for this is because of the JNDI requirement, which requires we use the `TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader`.  Tomcat boots and uses the `TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader` to load all the classes on the classpath, which includes my `@Entity` objects.  Since I am using Load Time Weaving `TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader` tries to weave my POJO's.  However this all happens **before** the Spring Context is initialized, so no transformers are available to `TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader` to weave the classes.  When Spring boots, it again loads the classes on the classpath and attempts weaving, now with a transformer, but the classes were already loaded by `TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader` so no transformations are attempted. If we could add a property that tells spring to attempt another transformation on startup - that would be a work around anyway. Best case scenario is that `TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader` correctly loads the transformer needed, maybe an attribute in the \?  That is apache at that point and I can create an issue there if need be.  If I am missing something please let me know, i added this post to the forum a bit ago and still has no replies on it.  Since no one seems to be able to add anything constructive on the post I felt creating a bug ticket would be the next step. Please see the forum posting for more detail - just right to the problem here.  I would like to see a Spring Feature that could handle this scenario, I know i can move to an EE Container and the weaving would be handled.  I don't want to have to be tied to an EE Container, I like the lightweight aspect of Tomcat.  Again, if there is a work around or already is a feature to deal with this please let me know!

Basically classQueue accumulates all possible classes that Spring will try to find a converter for. Instead of accumulating java.lang.Object as one of the possibilities it stores jpasecurity SecureObject because that is the inmediate superclass of the secured JPA Entity. Once it cannot find a converter it will cache that situation forever like this key:  ConverterCacheKey [sourceType = [TypeDescriptor com.nestorurquiza.model.InstrumentTraded$$EnhancerByCGLIB$$114fa3ec], targetType = [TypeDescriptor java.lang.String]]=NO_MATCH  From that moment on it will never rescan to find a converter.

However, this is not always desirable.  Consider the case where you have a method that takes an object of any type (`Object targetMethod(Object o)`) and does something generic with it.  With the `CollectionToObjectConverter`'s current behavior the method will never be called with collection itself, but rather the first element in that collection.  The default behavior is certainly very useful, but there are times when it's appropriate to get the collection itself.  An improvement could be that if the source collection is not assignable to the target type, the first element is extracted and that is used in the attempt to satisfy the conversion.  So in the example of `targetMethod(String s)` where a `Set` is passed in, the first `String` would be extracted and used.  But in the case of `targetMethod(Object o)` where a `Set` is passed in, the collection itself would be used.  It should be noted that this is a change in behavior from 3.0.5, although this may simply be due to bug fixing rather than anything intentional.

In integration services and application usage of Spring JDBC has advantage over JPA, specially then we need better performance.

Using BeanPropertyRowMapper we lost about 5-8% of performance (according my own tests again), but we have huge convenience from automatic mappings. The problem appears than we have strange mapping or ugly column naming strategy in database. We can use column aliases in the SQL statement, but there is better way for this, java way, how about standard `@Column` annotation?  In **Spring Integration** and in **Spring Batch** there is possibility to use RowMappers, it will be very convenient to use JPA Entities for automatic mappings.

The culprit is:  ```java private boolean supportsInternal(Class clazz, boolean checkForXmlRootElement) {   ... } ```  It checks input clazz only against explicit contextPath and classesToBeBound. The simplest solution would be to allow createJaxbContextFromPackages() to set scanned classes as classesToBound, since contextPath, classesToBeBound and packagesToScan are mutually exclusive. The following code would do the trick:  ```java private JAXBContext createJaxbContextFromPackages() throws JAXBException {   ...

String something() { } ```  , where `@CustomMapping` is some custom annotation to add custom request mapping condition in addition to `@RequestMapping`.  Create a custom condition using RequestMappingHandlerMapping subclass and override:  ```java @Override protected RequestCondition getCustomMethodCondition(Method method) {   CustomMapping methodAnnotation = AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(method, CustomMapping.class);   if (methodAnnotation != null)     return new CustomMappingCondition(methodAnnotation.value());   return null; } ```  This works great as an inclusion filter. If custom condition succeeds, then function something() would be chosen as a matching candidate in RequestMappingHandlerMapping.lookupHandlerMethod().  The problem arises, when custom condition wants to exclude a function (condition failed). Normally (at least that is what built-in conditions do), if condition failed, it would return NULL from RequestCondition.getMatchingCondition(), which would cause RequestMappingInfo.getMatchingCondition() to return NULL, which would exclude the current mapping from possible matches.  However, in the case of the custom condition, the logic is somewhat different. RequestConditionHolder.getMatchingCondition() is called, which in turn calls condition.getMatchingCondition(). Even if condition.getMatchingCondition() returned NULL (which would indicate that condition has failed, right?), RequestConditionHolder.getMatchingCondition() would always return either itself or a new RequestConditionHolder(). This means that ""custom"" in:  ```java RequestMappingInfo::getMatchingCondition() { ... RequestConditionHolder custom = customConditionHolder.getMatchingCondition(request); if (custom == null) {   return null; } ... } ```  is never going to be NULL and would never cause and exclusion of the match based on the custom condition.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1.1  **Attachments:** - [aop.xml](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19850/aop.xml) (_239 bytes_) - [RequestConditionHolderFix.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19851/RequestConditionHolderFix.java) (_1.42 kB_)  **Sub-tasks:** - #13784 Backport ""Custom condition in request mapping handler does not work as an exclusion filter""  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/8faa2e61ecf4f2c01252a7ab36194aa6e1cd2920, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/64ee5e579adcec97122fc0ee1414031da3be0c6e  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-19T17:59:18Z","2019-01-11T22:13:04Z"

It also adds an extension to the view name and then asks again for such a view. In out opinion, this could be too expensive operation, because internally views try to load template resources from file system and fail with exception. This is the way `VelocityEngine` tries to create views. More over, Velocity logs a message at ERROR level for each attempt to load a non-existing template.  Our custom improvement would be to use one-to-one relationship between media type and view resolver. We would like to select one view resolver by media type and then once ask it for a view.  We could have implemented that if `getCandidateViews` method would have visibility level of protected.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #13057 Content negotiation improvements","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-26T01:52:13Z","2019-01-11T14:21:17Z"

At the very least the JavaDoc should be cleared up to explicitly clarify this. -- Or, better (IMHO) would be if it would be handled automatically & transparently by the initLogging(String location, long refreshInterval) implementation - if a ""classpath:"" location is specified (inside a packaged JAR, as opposed to if its a File in the filesystem on the classpath) then just fall-back to initLogging(String location) [print a WARN?], as obviously you cannot refresh - the intention in that case is clear enough though to suck it up and move on anyways.  ---  No further details from [SPR-8253](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8253?redirect=false)","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-04-15T08:13:38Z","2019-01-12T05:30:30Z"

ORIGINAL             MODIFIED             The code contained in DynamicGroovyRouteBuilder was an exact copy of the groovy script that was statically compiled. Upon testing this new configuration, it failed. The failure was at first cryptic however upon further examination I determined that the root cause of the failure was due to the fact that the bean my groovy script was dependent upon had not been instantiated.  I was able to correct the problem by declaring the dependency in a slightly different way. Instead of relying on the ""depends-on"" attribute, I added a property element to the dynamic language bean which referenced the bean I depended upon. The resulting definition did work.  WORKING                      I am attaching a simple project that demonstrates the problem.

To avoid false positives when using JPA (backed by Hibernate) I propose that you add a new snippet that the describes a different approach.

An exception gets propagated to the caller of the template.  The second sentence implies that any exception propagates to the caller. This is wrong, because any implementation of the doInTransactionMethod() that throws a checked exception will cause a compile error. A better javadoc clarification would stress that we are only dealing with unchecked exceptions, e.g.      A RuntimeException thrown by the callback is treated as application exception that enforces a rollback. The RuntimeException gets propagated to the caller of the template.

When I use the annotation `@PersistenceContext(type=PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED, unitName=""..."")`, the `PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` throws a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` saying that it can't find the bean with the name of my test class.  If I remove the type argument (or set it to `PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION`), my test fails for unrelated reasons.  #### Reproducible example attached.  To reproduce, extract archives in archive, issue `""mvn install""` in `../dn-atomikos/trunk`, and then issue `""mvn clean test -Dtest=TwoPhaseCommitTest""` in `../db.jta/`.  If reproduced, you should get an exception like the one below. If you comment out `""type=PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)""` in `AbstractTwoPhaseCommitTest`, this exception goes away (and a new, unrelated exception may appear).

Technically speaking, I agree that this is incorrect, but it would be nice if the parsing of that property were a bit more tolerant.  For example, the parser could allow for several reasonable separators (like comma, semicolon, colon, whitespace, etc) and ignore empty profile names.  My use case is from Maven (see -X output below).  As you can see below, due to limitations in Maven, I'm passing ""-Dspring.profiles.active=dn,derby,"" (note trailing comma) to my tests.  This causes Spring to throw with the message ""java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid profile []: must contain text"".  Please enhance the parsing of the spring.profiles.active system property be more tolerant of its input format, allowing for a designated set of delimiters (possibly user-configured?), and ignoring empty profile names (or allow the user to configure whether empty names are to be ignored).

You have to deal with specific implementations like AbstractXmlApplicationContext or ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.  This comes about because I need to  create an ApplicationContextInitializer which is capable of adding context files under certain conditions.  However, there's no reliable way to get the existing config locations so that I can append to the array and call the ""setConfigLocations"" methods.  In particular, the getter and setter are availble for web contexts, but the getter is protected for AbstractXmlApplicationContext.  It would be ideal if there were come subinterface of ConfigurableApplicationContext which defined these methods, as well as a simple ""addConfigLocation"" method.  For the time being it seems that the Initializer functionality is relatively limited to activating profiles.   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-30T09:58:31Z","2018-12-27T11:44:33Z"

See SPR-7552. }  if (filename != null && filename.endsWith(XML_FILE_EXTENSION)) { 	this.propertiesPersister.loadFromXml(props, is); } ```  In Spring 3.1, that code looks like this:  ``` String filename = (location instanceof AbstractFileResolvingResource) ? 		location.getFilename() : null; if (filename != null && filename.endsWith(XML_FILE_EXTENSION)) { 	this.propertiesPersister.loadFromXml(props, is); } ```  The problem is, FileSystemResource doesn't extend AbstractFileResolvingResource.  So if an xml-formatted properties file is loaded as a FileSystemResource, it will not be loaded properly.   I don't know if the right answer is to make FileSystemResource extend AbstractFileResolvingResource (which seems to make sense) or to change the ""location instanceof AbstractFileResolvingResource"" above to catch both cases -- AbstractFileResolvingResource or FileSystemResource.   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/57851de88e84006afc104c4f22eb2fbaf2e0d3d1, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/1d9d3e6ff79ce9f0eca03b02cd1df705925575da  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-20T15:08:00Z","2012-06-19T03:39:27Z"

"","13117","Performance bottleneck and potential thread deadlock in DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry [SPR-8471]","**[Mark Davies](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=harloshmark)** opened **[SPR-8471](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8471?redirect=false)** and commented  A less significant version of this problem has already been raised under #10033 - a performance bottleneck affecting Wicket. However, the same issue causes a serious thread deadlock in our application, occasionally preventing application startup.  The basic issue seems to be that DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry takes a global synchronization lock when creating a singleton bean. Here is the code in that class:  ``` public Object getSingleton(String beanName, ObjectFactory singletonFactory) {      Assert.notNull(beanName, ""'beanName' must not be null"");      synchronized (this.singletonObjects) {           Object singletonObject = this.singletonObjects.get(beanName);           if (singletonObject == null) {           ... stuff ...                         singletonObject = singletonFactory.getObject();           ... stuff ... } ```  The synchronized block (the same this.singletonObjects reference is used by all threads entering the method) means that Spring can only create singleton beans one at a time, regardless of their type (beanName). This clearly introduces a performance penalty if an application has a large number of singleton beans to construct, e.g. at startup.  That is not the issue affecting our code, though. We see a deadlock, caused by the following two sets of behaviour:  1. We have Spring-managed singleton beans which perform database access in their constructor (basically loading and caching configuration sets from the database). In order to do this they obtain database connections, which are pooled, with relatively small pool sizes. If a pooled connection is not available, the calling thread blocks and waits until one becomes free. This is usually not a problem since queries are small and rapid, so pool wait times are low, and the maximum pool size is sufficient to work the databasea at full capacity anyway.  2. We also have non-Spring code doing database access. Such code obtains a database connection from the same pool, purely for the lifetime of running a query and processing a result set, so again very quick for almost cases in our system. But sometimes, whilst processing the result set, we need to use a Spring-managed bean, which may have singleton scope.  You now have a deadlock - thread number one is trying to get a Spring-managed singleton bean, which is waiting for a JDBC connection in its constructor; thread number two is running database code which has the JDBC connection and is waiting to create a Spring-managed singleton of a completely different type. Both thread own the resource needed by the other, so will wait forever. (OK, if the database pool size is two or higher you need two or more threads in the second state, but this has happened to us in customer environments, in production).  Obviously our application code is almost certainly less than ideal in how we use Spring, but it seems to me that we ought to be able to use Spring-managed beans which do database access in the manner I've described, without encountering unpleasant deadlocks such as this. Note that the problem is actually much more general than this particular example of database connections: if your singleton beans require any kind of global monitor, which is also used outside of the context of Spring, you have a deadlock condition.  Both the originally-reported performance problem, and this deadlock, could be solved by a simple improvement to  DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry. The getSingleton() method should not synchronize on a global monitor, but instead a monitor specific to the beanName you are instantiating. This is the correct level at which to lock - what you are trying to do is prevent a bean of a certain type being created more than once, but allowing two beans of different types to construct at the same time is perfectly reasonable. Of course you have to synchronize access to the underlying collections with a global lock, but the construction of the singleton bean does not need to be protected with the same global monitor. For instance I believe this kind of thing would do it:  ``` public Object getSingleton(String beanName, ObjectFactory singletonFactory) {      Object bean;      Object perBeanMonitor;      synchronized (GLOBAL_MONITOR) {           perBeanMonitor = getPerBeanMonitor(beanName);      }      synchronized (perBeanMonitor) {           synchronized (GLOBAL_MONITOR) {                bean = getBeanFromRegistry(beanName);           }           if (bean==null) {                Object bean = doConstructBean(beanName, singletonFactory);                synchronized (GLOBAL_MONITOR) {                         addToRegistry(beanName, bean);                }           }      }      return bean; } ```  It would be extremely helpful if this approach could be implemented in this core part of the Spring framework. We rely on singleton construction to be performant and thread-safe; the fact that DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry behaves as it currently does is causing us serious production problems at client sites, and, whilst we can modify our application code to work around the issue, I do see this as a fundamental flaw in Spring - would be nice to get a quick fix please.  ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6  **Attachments:** - [test-case.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19616/test-case.zip) (_3.09 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #13428 Deadlock during application context creation (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #14470 A Java Thread deadlock has occured (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #13837 Deadlock on the beanDefinitionMap and singletonObjects (_**""is duplicated by""**_) - #12374 Deadlock between DefaultListableBeanFactory and DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry, perhaps due to lazily-instantiated aspect - #14452 Non-singleton beans performance issue - #14654 Deadlock in DefaultListableBeanFactory/DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry - #14985 AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster#getApplicationListeners() should have double check for 'this.retrieverCache.get(cacheKey)' within synchronized block  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/dd68fecbf2509faa189234807f30bbf364a691f1, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/52124fa31b17fee7b6ffdfc92ec9fe14ad9a0561  19 votes, 26 watchers","closed","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-20T10:30:35Z","2020-08-31T15:16:19Z"

I have 3 Configuration classes: the main AppConfig.java, the web MvcConfig.java and BootStrapConfig.java for doing some data creation.  The AppConfig contains the `@EnableSpringConfigured` annotation to enable dependency injection when creating new domain objects. This class looks like:  ``` @Configuration @ComponentScan(basePackages = ""com.appspot.springaop"") @EnableSpringConfigured public class AppConfig { 	.. } ```  The BootStrapConfig looks like:  ``` @Configuration public class BootStrapConfig { 	 	@Bean 	public BootStrap bootStrap() { 		return new BootStrap(); 	}  	private class BootStrap {  		@PostConstruct 		public void init() { 			// create data by instantiating domain classes with 'new' 			.. 		} 	} } ```  Note that this one does not have the `@EnableSpringConfigured` as I **assume** once (in AppConfig) should be enough.  I'm loading the configuration classes with the following definition in web.xml:  ``` 	 		contextClass 		org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext 	  	 		contextConfigLocation 		com.appspot.springaop.config 	 ```  When running this code on local (!) Google App Engine the AOP stuff works perfectly as expected. But on the production Google Infrastructure I always noticed inconsistent behavior as the AOP aspects did not seem to work always between deployments. Note that that time I was using dailly development snapshots of Spring 3.1 so I did not give it much attention then as it worked quit often the other day. Also note that I was changing my own JAva config setup because of new features in different 3.1 RC's.  Now after the 3.1 GA locally everything works still fine, but on Google App Engine infrastructure I'm not able to get it working anymore. Spring works fine on it, only the AOP seems to be broken with `@EnableSpringConfigured`.  Note that I also noticed this DEBUG message on the Google App Engine infrastructure:  ``` [s~spring-aop/3.356043308451020324].: 10:39:43,186 DEBUG [org.springframework.beans.factory.wiring.BeanConfigurerSupport] BeanFactory has not been set on BeanConfigurerSupport: Make sure this configurer runs in a Spring container. Unable to configure bean of type [com.appspot.springaop.domain.Book]. Proceeding without injection. ```  Another thing I found out is that when I move the BootStrap `@Bean` definition and inner class from BootStrapConfig to AppConfig it works on Google App Engine infrastructure.  Is there something I'm doing wrong?  Could it maybe the case that on the Configuration classes are processed in different order? E.g. DevelopmentBootStrapConfig before AppConfig which means `@EnableSpringConfigured` was not yet invoked maybe?  I don't know how this internally works...

However when using controller with multiple actions (like CRUD) there is no straightforward way to set the allowed field and validator per action.  It would be a huge improvement if there would be a way to map `@InitBinder` to action(s) directly. For validation it might also be an option to specify validator class in `@Valid` annotation like: `@Valid`(validator = CreateUserValidator.class) CreateUserForm form  Probably there are better alternatives, but any other solution would be good, as I think at the moment there is no alternative at all.

I created these two working servlets to verify that `@Value` annotation works fine when not used directly on servlet (that is the case for Lorem) and in Foo servlet I show that the Properties object is loaded correctly using `@Autowired` annotation.

The problem is in findPersistenceMetadata method which looks for persistence annotations in registered beans.  The current implementation loops through **declared** fields and **declared** methods of the actual class of the bean to detect eventual persistence annotation and register a PersistenceElement for each.  And this process is repeated in a do ... while loop for each class in the inheritance hierarchy of the bean's class.  Here is a simplified verion of the current algorithm:  Class targetClass = clazz;do { LinkedList currElements = new LinkedList(); for (Field field : targetClass.getDeclaredFields()) { // ....        currElements.add(new PersistenceElement(field, null)); } for (Method method : targetClass.getDeclaredMethods()) { // ....        PropertyDescriptor pd = BeanUtils.findPropertyForMethod(method); currElements.add(new PersistenceElement(method, pd)); } elements.addAll(0, currElements); targetClass = targetClass.getSuperclass(); }while (targetClass != null && targetClass != Object.class); metadata = new InjectionMetadata(clazz, elements);  The problem is that a PersistentElement is registered for each definition of a field or method in the class hierarchy : the most specific definition is not the only one registered.  As a consequence having this:  public class GenericRepository {      private EntityManager entityManager;          @PersistenceContext     public void setEntityManager(EntityManager em) {         this.entityManager = em;     }          // ....}  public class UserRepository extends GenericRepository {      @Override     @PersistenceContext(unitName=""my-unit"")     public void setEntityManager(EntityManager em) {         parent.setEntityManager(em);     }          // ....}  Would leed to 2 injected elements in metadata:  * One for `@PersistenceContext` without unitName * One for `@PersistenceContext` with unitName ""my-unit""  Then Spring injects the EntityManager based on the first element definition and skip the second one **which is the most specific**!  There might be a good reason for iterating through each declared field/method of each super class of the bean's class but I don't get why you do not simply use the getMethods() and getFields() reflection methods which return the most specific definition of the field/method with annotations and would avoid having multiple injectedElements for persistence matadata?   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/65077d262c396ee919f84808bafb059ef3618e96, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/49e61d2680c66e6d59aaa2d483300d4ac76cbc78","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-09T09:23:47Z","2012-06-19T03:39:38Z"

In the +[message specification](http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/jms/Message.html)+ is defined method _set/get_ JMSExpiration, JMSDeliveryMode and JMSPriority, which does not use in JmsTemplate.  #### Change code motivation:  We have a mix of permanent and temporary message with a different expiration time. It is not therefore possible to create multiple JMS templates, because the expiration time is different for each message.  #### Change code summary:  1. For each message property is create message specify method in JmsTemplate:  ``` public int getPriority(Message message) throws JMSException {  	int messagePriority = message.getJMSPriority(); 	if (messagePriority == Message.DEFAULT_PRIORITY) { 		messagePriority = getPriority(); 	}  	return messagePriority; } ```  1.

We use data binding to map request parameters to fields of a form, and one field contains such a list. For example, a field with name ""f[list][0]"" will map to the 0th element of the list, if form element getF().get(""list"") is the list.  The application did work successfully in 3.0.5.RELEASE, but is failing in 3.0.6.RELEASE.  I am attaching JUnit test case that reproduces the issue.  **Expected result:**  JUnit test passes  **Actual result in 3.0.6.RELEASE:**  Data binding succeeds, but result validation fails: java.lang.AssertionError: expected:\ but was:\ at bugreport.GrowingListDataBinderRegression.testDataBinding(GrowingListDataBinderRegression.java:133)  The list contents after data binding was expected to be [""firstElement"", ""secondElement""], but the actual contents is [null, ""secondElement""]. Both values were assigned to the same position in the list and only the second one survived.  **Actual result in 3.1.0.RC1:**  Data binding fails: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not a collection, array, or map: cannot resolve nested value types  **Result of debugging in 3.0.6.RELEASE:**  The problem is in class org.springframework.beans.BeanWrapperImpl in method setPropertyValue(PropertyTokenHolder,PropertyValue)  There is the following code in the ""if (propValue instanceof List)"" branch:  980: int size = list.size(); 981: Object oldValue = null; 982: if (isExtractOldValueForEditor() && index < size) { 983:    oldValue = list.get(index); 984: } 985: Object convertedValue = convertIfNecessary(...); 986: 987: if (index >= size && index < this.autoGrowCollectionLimit) { ... 999:    list.add(convertedValue); 1000: } 1001: else { ... 1003:   list.set(index, convertedValue); ... 1009: }  The problem is that list size is calculated on line 980 and remembered and is later used to decide whether to call list.add() or list.set(). If I start with empty list and there is incoming request parameter with name ""f[list][0]"", the list size on line 981 is evaluated to be zero.  The list.get() call on line 983 is skipped thanks to (&& index < size) check, but on line 985 the convertIfNecessary() call does its own getProperty() call and calls list.get(0) and that creates 0th element of the list. I will cite the stacktrace of that call below.  When we are on line 987 the value of size variable is still 0, but the list already contains one element. Execution continues to line 999, where list.add() is called. When the method returns, the list contains two elements [null, ""firstElement""] instead of just one [""firstElement""].  If anyone is curious, the list.get() call performed inside of convertIfNecessary() has the following stack trace:  > Thread [main] (Suspended (breakpoint at line 790 in BeanWrapperImpl))	 > BeanWrapperImpl.getPropertyValue(BeanWrapperImpl$PropertyTokenHolder) line: 790	 > BeanWrapperImpl.getPropertyValue(String) line: 718	 > BeanWrapperImpl.getPropertyType(String) line: 366	 > BeanWrapperImpl(PropertyEditorRegistrySupport).findCustomEditor(Class, String) line: 341	 > TypeConverterDelegate.convertIfNecessary(String, Object, Object, Class\, TypeDescriptor) line: 134	 > BeanWrapperImpl.convertIfNecessary(String, Object, Object, Class, TypeDescriptor) line: 466	 > BeanWrapperImpl.setPropertyValue(BeanWrapperImpl$PropertyTokenHolder, PropertyValue) line: 985  **Proposed fix:**  Add  size = list.size();  call before line 987 in class BeanWrapperImpl.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.6, 3.1 RC1  **Attachments:** - [GrowingListDataBinderRegression.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19102/GrowingListDataBinderRegression.java) (_3.04 kB_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/8213d0cb504b1c73cbb0df028a9745b0cb4a7e5a, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/569426dfdfec186e98a6ae4bd8ebf946720206b1  **Backported to:** [3.0.7](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/74?closed=1)","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-08T14:02:15Z","2012-06-19T03:39:07Z"

Since these new field types permit modern browsers (especially mobile browsers) to handle certain fields in a special manner (e.g. bring up different variant of on-screen keyboard conducive to the type of field being edited) and because they degrade gracefully, they're quickly becoming popular to use, but unfortunately, Spring MVC's form-binding tags don't currently permit use of these new field types.  i.e. there is no  or  tag.  It seems it would be rather simple to include these by extending org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.InputTag to change the field type, in much the same way that org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.form.PasswordInputTag already does.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #13336 Duplicate ""type"" attribute rendered in JSP InputTag  8 votes, 14 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-24T12:05:31Z","2019-01-11T13:09:30Z"

The problem is that StringHttpMessageConverter.DEFAULT_CHARSET value is ISO-8859-1 by default, and it is used if Accept header of current request doesn't contain charset=XXX parameter. It is easy to provide custom Accept Header value while using RestTemplate, however when we try to access or REST services via browser like firefox it is not possible (without an add on) as far as I know.  If DEFAULT_CHARSET value were UTF-8, instead of ISO-8859-9, the problem would gone away. Another option would be to provide a way to configure this property via a setter method as well. To me, it is better to change it into UTF-8 unless there is a special meaning of making it ISO-8859-1.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Issue Links:** - #13734 StringHttpMessageConverter should use HttpServletRequest encoding for POST body","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-08T01:52:20Z","2019-01-11T22:26:49Z"

I was accidentally POSTing to a method that accepts HTTP GET (It was a typo - I'm a little tired), but the weird thing is that Spring was executing a GET action anyway - it wasn't throwing an error.  Here is the mapping for my GET action that I was POSTing to instead:  ```java @RequestMapping(value = ""/partialMapping/{partialMappingId}/edit"", method = RequestMethod.GET) public ModelAndView edit(@PathVariable long partialMappingId) {     return new ModelAndView(view(""edit""), ""partialMapping"", 	partialMappingService.findPartialMapping(partialMappingId)); } ```  What I would have expected was for Spring to say, ""There is no action called /partialMapping/{partialMappingId}/edit for HTTP POST"".  Instead... if you use the `HandlerAdapter` and pass it ""POST"" and ""/partialMapping/1/edit"", it runs my `index` action instead (""/partialMapping""). It doesn't throw an error. Why?  Is this a bug in spring, or is this desired behaviour?

Unfortunately, whenever spring parses a date that was given via user input, it does some funky thing with the time-zomes or something. So if you enter ""10/19/2001"", it sets the date to ""10/18/2001 20:00:00"" (as seen in the database).  I thought moving to Joda Time and using LocalDate would fix this problem, but that hasn't happened... so I suspect the problem is with SimpleTimeFormat or the Spring Framework itself - I don't know.  Anyway, regardless of who's fault it is, ultimately since it's your annotation, the responsibility probably lies with you guys. Maybe don't use SimpleDateFormat anymore? I'm not sure.  Regardless, this is pretty critical for me. I do not care about timezones in this application. I do not want to deal with the complexity of time zones at all - the date is sufficient exactly as the user has entered it. Unfortunately, there's no way to configure this annotation to deal with timezones, nor is there a way to get it parsed to ignore timezone conversions and simply create a date that actually is what it says.

[SPR-8665]","**[Ken Egervari](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=egervari)** opened **[SPR-8665](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8665?redirect=false)** and commented  I have an application that I've recently upgraded to 3.0.6 from 3.0.5. The application used a property editor to convert a String to a List of objects, back and forth.  I am positive this code used to work. In fact, the unit tests for the property editor continue to work as expected.  However, whenever a controller uses the property editor, it wraps the List of objects with ANOTHER list, which is absolutely not what we want to happen. Did they change how property editors work? How do I fix it?  My init binder method looks like this:  ``` @InitBinder public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {      binder.registerCustomEditor(List.class, new UsernamesToRecipientsEditor(userAccountDao)); } ```  Because java is weakly typed when it comes to List, I want you to know that this is really a `List` and not just a List of any random object. Here is the property editor code:  ``` public class UsernamesToRecipientsEditor extends PropertyEditorSupport {          private UserAccountDao dao;          public UsernamesToRecipientsEditor(UserAccountDao dao) {                   this.dao = dao;          }          @Override          public String getAsText() {                   Object obj = getValue();                   if(obj == null) {                            return """";                   }                   if(obj instanceof List) {                            List recipients = (List) obj;                            StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();                            for(Iterator iterator = recipients.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {                                     Recipient recipient = iterator.next();                                     builder.append(recipient.getUserAccount().getUsername());                                     if(iterator.hasNext()) {                                                  builder.append("", "");                                     }                            }                            return builder.toString();                   }                   throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Value must be a UserAccount"");          }          @Override          public void setAsText(String text) {                   List recipients = new ArrayList();                   if(!StringUtils.hasText(text)) {                            setValue(recipients);                            return;                   }                   for(String username : StringUtils.commaDelimitedListToSet(text)) {                            UserAccount userAccount = dao.findByUsername(username.trim());                            if(userAccount != null) {                                     Recipient recipient = new Recipient(userAccount);                                     if(!containsRecipient(recipients, recipient)) {                                                  recipients.add(recipient);                                     }                            }                   }                   setValue(recipients);          }          private boolean containsRecipient(List recipients, Recipient recipient) {                   for(Recipient r : recipients) {                            if(r.getUserAccount().getId() == recipient.getUserAccount().getId()) return true;                   }                   return false;          } } ```  Basically what this code does is it converts a string containing a bunch of username's separated by commas and converts them to the actual user objects, back and forth between them. It works in unit tests, and this worked in the past.  Unfortunately, after Spring MVC calls into this property editor, it wraps the result from `setValue(recipients)` inside of ANOTHER List... so the end result is a ""List of a List of Recipients"". This isn't what I want.  Since this code above USED TO work, I have to conclude that some bug or behavioral change has happened.

Adding the missing `@Configuration` annotation solves the problem, however the problem and solution isn't obvious since wiring/injection appeared to work.

This leads to inconsistent conversion results for these types depending upon whether a ConversionService is registered or not.  To prevent this issue, a BeanWrapper could enable its own conversion rules, for the types it natively supports such as File and Resource, by registering new converters against a ConversionService configured via beanWrapper.setConversionService(ConversionService). One thing to consider with adding this capability is the possibility of over-writing user-defined conversion rules for supported BeanWrapper types.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 RC1  **Issue Links:** - [INT-1893](https://jira.spring.io/browse/INT-1893) Placeholder to track the progress of SPR-8818 (formerly SPR-8294) which causes inconsistent behavior in file inbound adapter - #12942 Inconsistencies in property conversions when using ConversionService (_**""supersedes""**_)  1 votes, 3 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-04T10:07:17Z","2019-01-11T14:40:37Z"

I have autowired the web application context config class, too, as I want to retrieve some fields from there that I have `@Value` annotated, by calling some type converting methods. The autowiring seems to fail as I get Nullpointer exceptions on lines where the webapp config class method is called. I was debugging the server: the web application context has been built using the config class and the fields I want to call methods on are filled properly.

This means that if you have multiple taglibs (or if you load multiple FreeMarkerViews in a page), then the first time you load that page it's extremely slow.  Is there any reason not to just do: this.taglibFactory = getConfiguration().getTaglibFactory() and reuse the freemarker configurer's taglib factory?

Its a maven project with TestNG.  ```xml  	 	 	 	  ```  I have one default context configuration (which includes the database) and several extensions: for instance:  ```java @ContextConfiguration(""/spring/default.xml"") public class PodcastControllerTest extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests {...}  // and  @ContextConfiguration({ ""/spring/components/amq-broker.xml"", ""/spring/default.xml"" }) public class SophoraAvDocumentTest extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests {...} ```  When executing the tests with maven (maven-surefire), all the tests with the first configuration reuse the same context (due to context caching). The first test-setup with the second configuration should create a fresh application context, but it fails with Database-Errors indicating, that the objects to create already exist. (I spent quite some time debugging the maven process).  Here is the maven surefire config:  ```xml  	org.apache.maven.plugins 	maven-surefire-plugin 	 		1 		slow,local 		-Xmx1024m 	  ```  My theory is, that both contexts connect to the same database instance, because they are in the same vm and the name of the db-instance is the same: EmbeddedDatabaseFactory.databaseName = ""testdb"";  I did not find a way to assign the name with the jdbc:embedded-database-Tag.  So I created a custom EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder which assigns a random name (UUID) to every new instance:  ```java EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder builder = new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder().setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL).setName(UUID.randomUUID().toString()); for (String sqlResource : this.scripts) {     builder.addScript(sqlResource); } this.embeddedDatabase = builder.build(); ```  With this one the errors are gone. Would it be a solution to add a configuration-option to jdbc:embedded-database for random db-instance names?  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Issue Links:** - #17432 Introduce database-name attribute in  (_**""depends on""**_) - #17437 Document support for generating unique names for embedded databases in the reference manual (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #15999 Embedded database connection closed by shutdown() method - #13560 Using multiple declarations of jdbc:embedded-database creates only one H2 instance per JVM - #12260 jdbc:datasource lacks 'name' attribute or related mechanism  6 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-14T02:54:07Z","2019-01-11T15:03:05Z"

In one of my scripts there is a stored procedure. Database setup fails when executing this script.  I found out that this is due to automatic statement splitting in `ResourceDatabasePopulator`. Here all statements in a script are split on semicolons. So my stored procedure is cut into pieces (after `p_date_value DAY;`).  ```sql CREATE FUNCTION pkg_verweildauer.get_pub_ende (IN p_pub_start TIMESTAMP, IN p_date_unit VARCHAR(255), IN p_date_value NUMERIC)  RETURNS timestamp READS SQL DATA BEGIN ATOMIC  DECLARE v_pub_ende timestamp; case p_date_unit 	when 'DAYS' then 		SET v_pub_ende = p_pub_start + p_date_value DAY; 	when 'WEEKS' then 		SET v_pub_ende = TIMESTAMPADD(SQL_TSI_WEEK, p_date_value, p_pub_start); 	when 'MONTHS' then 		SET v_pub_ende = TIMESTAMPADD(SQL_TSI_MONTH, p_date_value, p_pub_start); 	when 'YEARS' then 		SET v_pub_ende = TIMESTAMPADD(SQL_TSI_YEAR, p_date_value, p_pub_start); 	else 		SET v_pub_ende = p_pub_start + 365 DAY; end case; RETURN v_pub_ende;  END; ```  A simple solution would be to add a parameter to the `` tag to disable splitting on file basis. Unfortunately `ResourceDatabasePopulator` cannot be exchanged in the `EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder`.  I had to write a post processing bean, to add the stored function.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - #13525 Error when parsing PMS stored procedure script.

I haven't been able to clarify whether this method should perform a synchronous stop of the component or just start an asynchronous shutdown sequence and probably return before shutdown is complete (and without a mean to signal shutdown completion).

The getSessionMutex(HttpSession session) in the WebUtils class is pretty straight forward and implemented correctly.  The implementation of a similar method, getSessionMutex(PortletSession session) looks like the same implementation, substituting HttpSession with PortletSession.  In the portlet world, PortletSession is a thin vineer over HttpSession.  The difference is that portlets provide two different scopes within this session, APPLICATION_SCOPE and PORTLET_SCOPE.  APPLICATION_SCOPE is essentially equivalent to HttpSession.  PORTLET_SCOPE differs in that it is essentially limited (often by namespacing from an implementation perspective) to a given portlet.  This means that by default, one portlet cannot see another portlets session unless they are explicitly sharing objects in the ""APPLICATION_SCOPE"".  Long story short, the following line in the current PortletUtils class:  Object mutex = session.getAttribute(WebUtils.SESSION_MUTEX_ATTRIBUTE);  Is attempting to get the variable placed into HttpSession (ie APPLICATION_SCOPE) by searching in PORTLET_SCOPE.  For portlet containers like WebSphere, this will never work.  To get things out of HttpSession (ie the APPLICATION_SCOPE of PortletSession), the line above needs to be changed to:  Object mutex = session.getAttribute(WebUtils.SESSION_MUTEX_ATTRIBUTE, PortletSession.APPLICATION_SCOPE);  This issue may not have been found because the code will silently fail and default to providing PortletSession to synchronize on.  Also, not all vendors choose to implement this feature.  In an IBM environment however, the resulting behavior is not safe if you are using parallel portlet rendering.   ---  **Affects:** 2.0 final  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/21f61e3680a1f15cfde12a75f4e0fcdc32591234, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/bffa50e31a5410def099d6f3b7bf6e2b624b5ac6  **Backported to:** [3.0.7](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/milestone/74?closed=1)","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-30T11:49:24Z","2012-06-19T03:39:26Z"

As a result, one has to implement CustomSessionLocaleResolver, that is incompatible with SessionLocaleResolver interface.  ``` public class LocalizedMessageSource { 	 	@Autowired 	private MessageSource resource; 	@Autowired 	private PortletSessionLocaleResolver localeResolver;   	public String getMessage(MessageSourceResolvable resolvable) { 		return resource.getMessage(resolvable, getLocale()); 	}  	public String getMessage(String code, Object[] args) { 		return resource.getMessage(code, args, getLocale()); 	}  	public String getMessage(String code, Object[] args, String defaultMessage, Locale locale) { 		return resource.getMessage(code, args, defaultMessage, getLocale()); 	}  	private Locale getLocale() { 		return localeResolver.resolveLocale(getCurrentRequest()); 	}  	private PortletRequest getCurrentRequest() { 		return ((PortletRequestAttributes) RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes()).getRequest(); 	} } ```  ``` public class PortletSessionLocaleResolver  {   	public static final String LOCALE_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = ""LOCALE""; 	public static final int PORTAL_SCOPE = 0x03; 	 	private Locale defaultLocale;  	public Locale resolveLocale(PortletRequest request) { 		PortletSession session = request.getPortletSession(false); 		Locale locale = (Locale) session.getAttribute(LOCALE_SESSION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME, PORTAL_SCOPE); 		if (locale == null) { 			locale = determineDefaultLocale(request); 		} 		return locale; 	}  	protected Locale determineDefaultLocale(PortletRequest request) { 		Locale defaultLocale = getDefaultLocale(); 		if (defaultLocale == null) { 			defaultLocale = request.getLocale(); 		} 		return defaultLocale; 	}  	public Object getSessionAttribute(PortletRequest request, String name) { 		PortletSession session = request.getPortletSession(false); 		return (session != null ? session.getAttribute(name, PORTAL_SCOPE) : null); 	} 	 	public void setSessionAttribute(PortletRequest request, String name, Object value) { 		if (value != null) { 			request.getPortletSession().setAttribute(name, value, PORTAL_SCOPE); 		} 		else { 			PortletSession session = request.getPortletSession(false); 			if (session != null) { 				session.removeAttribute(name); 			} 		} 	} 	 	public void setDefaultLocale(Locale defaultLocale) { 		this.defaultLocale = defaultLocale; 	}  	protected Locale getDefaultLocale() { 		return this.defaultLocale; 	} 	 } ```  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Attachments:** - [kt9.png](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18494/kt9.png) (_121.82 kB_)  1 votes, 0 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-23T11:34:10Z","2019-01-11T13:22:27Z"
"","12915","Possibility to explicitly prevent model to be enriched with CommandObject / ImplicitModel when dispached to View [SPR-8267]","**[Josef Vychtrle](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=lisak)** opened **[SPR-8267](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8267?redirect=false)** and commented  as `@ResponseBody` is not implemented, when one needs to respond to Ajax POST request with some success/error messages via JSON, the model after dispatching to VIEW, contains also the implicitModel - the commandObject from the POST request ... so that at ""someView"" the map contains the entire CommandObject... there is no way to prevent it. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO ACTIONREQUEST AND THERE SHOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO NOT HAVE THE COMMANDEDOBJECT BE PROPAGATED INTO THE VIEW - IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.  Action request from view layer goes to this method:  ``` @ActionMapping(params = ""javax.portlet.action=sample"") public void response(ActionRequest request, ActionResponse response, Bean bean) {          response.setRenderParameter(""javax.portlet.action"", ""success"");          List fileList = request.getFiles(""file""); } ```  render phase follows :  ``` @RequestMapping(params = ""javax.portlet.action=success"") public ModelAndView process(RenderRequest request, Model model) throws IOException {          Map map = new HashMap();          map.put(""test"", new Integer(1));          return new ModelAndView(""someView"", map); } ```  You create a ""bean"" view :  ``` @Component(""someView"") public class SomeView extends AbstractView {          private Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(SomeView.class);          @Override          protected void renderMergedOutputModel(Map map, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)                            throws Exception {          logger.info(""Resolving ajax request view - "" + map);          JSONObject jsonObj = new JSONObject(map);          logger.info(""content Type = "" + getContentType());          response.setContentType(""application/json"");          response.setCharacterEncoding(""UTF-8"");          response.getWriter().write(jsonObj.toString());          response.getWriter().flush();          } } ```  This is the reason of the ImplicitModel / CommandObject being dispatched to VIEW together with custom model ... and in Portlet environment it is a huge disadvantage when `@ResponseBody` is missing. It is very hard then getting JSON out of the model  ```  if (returnValue instanceof ModelAndView) {     ModelAndView mav = (ModelAndView) returnValue;     mav.getModelMap().mergeAttributes(implicitModel);     return mav; } else if (returnValue instanceof org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView) {     org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView smav = (org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView) returnValue;     ModelAndView mav = (smav.isReference() ? 	new ModelAndView(smav.getViewName(), smav.getModelMap()) : 	new ModelAndView(smav.getView(), smav.getModelMap()));     mav.getModelMap().mergeAttributes(implicitModel);     return mav; } else if (returnValue instanceof Model) {     return new ModelAndView().addAllObjects(implicitModel).addAllObjects(((Model) returnValue).asMap()); } else if (returnValue instanceof View) {     return new ModelAndView(returnValue).addAllObjects(implicitModel); } else if (handlerMethod.isAnnotationPresent(ModelAttribute.class)) {     addReturnValueAsModelAttribute(handlerMethod, handlerType, returnValue, implicitModel);     return new ModelAndView().addAllObjects(implicitModel); } else if (returnValue instanceof Map) {     return new ModelAndView().addAllObjects(implicitModel).addAllObjects((Map) returnValue);     } else if (returnValue instanceof String) {     return new ModelAndView((String) returnValue).addAllObjects(implicitModel); } ```    ---  1 votes, 0 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-04-21T08:18:30Z","2018-12-25T11:02:34Z"

Given the following configuration it is possible to traverse one hierachy up and get access to resources which may not should be exposed to the outside.  **Example:** Given the application runs under /myapp and the DispatcherServlet is mapped onto path /main/* and the configuration of the ResourceHttpRequestHandler is as follows:   With a tool like ""Burp Proxy"" it is now possible to issue a request like that: GET /myapp/main/resources/../secret-web-resources/secret.txt HTTP/1.1  This would traverse up to path /META-INF/secret-web-resources and expose ""secret.txt"".  A more fatal configuration would be  which would allow for an attacker to expose ""web.xml"" with a request like GET /myapp/main/resources/../web.xml HTTP/1.1  The deeper the mapping of ResourceHttpRequestHandler is, the higher the path can be traversed. A mapping like  would even allow for traversing two directories up. That is because the request URI seems to be resolved by Tomcat before it tries find a matching servlet mapping. Later on the original path - containing "".."" - gets passed to the servlet. So it is possible that the resulting URI doesn't match the Spring DispatcherServlet mapping any more. This seems to be a kind of barrier for the directory traversal attack.  Also classpath resources (eg. classpath:/dir/) can be exposed that way. The tests were performed with Tomcat 6.0.29 under Windows XP SP 3.  **Summary:** - ResourceHttpRequestHandler doesn't check for directory traversal - Thus resources either in web context or classpath with a known media type can be exposed - The deeper the mapping of the ResourceHttpRequestHandler is, the higher the path can be traversed  In my book, the ResourceServlet from Spring WebFlow follows a much more secure approach by matching the path against some patterns to check if it is allowed.  **Suggestions:** The ResourceHttpRequestHandler should check if the resolved Resource is beneath the given location and **NOT** above of it. Following that approach the attacker would be jailed into the (parent) location. From a user's perspective it would be much more intuitive if only resources beneath a given location are exposed to the outside.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.4, 3.0.5  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/41b9a461df287e4793eb722671bc3a75b65ebf25, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/fd7e0b405b1fa418ed7449200a42d77a145f92e8","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-06T11:52:06Z","2019-01-11T13:20:13Z"

This behaviour cannot be overridden for use in `SimpleJdbcTemplate` because it's a private final field.  If `org.springframework.jdbc.core.metadata.TableMetaDataContext.createInsertString(String[])` prepended the database name (is this the catalog name?) before the `schema.table_name` then this would just work. Similarly if `SimpleJdbcTemplate` allowed the `TableMetaDataContext` to be set, we could implement this ourselves.  **Workaround** is to use `withoutTableColumnMetaDataAccess()`, specify the column names explicitly and give the table name as `database_name..table_name`.  **Use case** database server login per system component with appropriate privileges to the multiple databases in the database server.

In the Tiles 2 framework, it is possible to configure multiple or non-default Tiles containers within the same web application. This is useful/required in cases where Spring MVC and another framework live in the same web application and both use the Tiles framework.  To retrieve the proper Tiles container, the getter ServletUtil.getCurrentContainer(ServletRequest request, ServletContext context) should be used. In the Spring code, however, the simplified getter getContainer(ServletContext context) is used, which just returns the default Tiles container and returns null if a custom ""container key"" is used.  To reproduce:  1) Within the Tiles framework, set up a Tiles container with a non-default ""container key"". 2) Add the following code to DispatcherServlet doService()  //Tell the Tiles framework to use a non-default Tiles container. Necessary for cases where Spring MVC and //another MVC framework live in the same web application since they have different PreparerFactory classes ServletUtil.setCurrentContainer(request, request.getSession().getServletContext(), MY_NON_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_KEY);  3) All calls to ServletUtil.getContainer(ServletContext context) within the Spring code will return null.

There are several use cases where making this key fully configurable would reveal highly useful.  e.g. 'myapp1_profiles_active', 'myapp2_profiles_active', 'foobar_x', etc.  One idea behind the newly introduced Spring profile feature is to be able to trigger a specific configuration in an application without changing the content of the application, just by introducing a variable that will be read by Spring at startup.  This key value can be read from the system environment variable (no additional parameter needed when starting an application) or from the java system properties, traditionally passed with -Dkey=value in the command line used to stat the application.  When you have several applications running on a single machine, such as when you work on different applications as a developer, you may quickly end up needing to pass different spring active profile values to each application.  This isn't possible with system environment variable. You can only specify different spring.profiles.active value per application through Java system properties, which can become quiet cumbersome when you have many run/debug configuration in your IDE, or when you use maven command line.  Allowing for a fully configurable key through a simple annotation, something like `@ActiveProfilesPropertyName`(""myapp_profiles_active""), or it's equivalent in XML, would allow for a higher level of configurability. This would be used only by the ones that need this higher level, conventional key value would apply by default.   ---  **Reference URL:** https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-8869?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=73077  1 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-24T23:40:18Z","2019-01-11T15:09:50Z"

But when loading a page where pool type enum is already populated in a model, the above StringToPoolTypeConverterFactory will not work because we have to register another converter factory for conversion of PoolType to String like for example below :  public class PoolTypeToStringConverterFactory implements ConverterFactory {  public \ Converter getConverter( Class\ targetType) {  return new PoolTypeEnumToStingConverter\(); }  private final class PoolTypeEnumToStingConverter\ implements Converter {  `@SuppressWarnings`(""unchecked"") public T convert(final PoolType poolType) { return poolType != null ?

NOTE: the url that is returned by Weblogic is file:c:/weblogic/tmp/blah/blah/blah/resources/images/img.gif  * The ServletContextResource.getFile() uses WebUtils.getRealPath(), which is returning /resources/images/img.gif and it tries to then create a File object.

So this can easily be fixed by adding the following info to the list of imported packages in the OSGi Manifest: javax.persistence.metamodel;version=""[1.0.0, 3.0.0)"";resolution:=""optional""  See the attached manifest files for details. One is the original manifest file of org.springframework.orm-3.1.0.RELEASE.jar.original and the other is a corrected manifest.  I have done so in my development environment and it works. Yet I have not really figured out how that line can be added during the regular spring build, as the OSGi manifest seems to be generated. Feel free to contact me for more details.

Please consider this as extansion for previouse issue: #12958 (link https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-8309)  Our idea here was to enable full configuration of marshaller through the schema, so we added additional attributes to castor-marshaller.  I believe the CastorMarshallerBeanDefinitionParser would need a comment here, I tried to simply the implementation as much as possible and made it generic in order to allow handling multpile attributes, that is way I decided to extend the AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser. The CastorMarshallerBeanDefinitionParser recognize the type of property (primitive or value type/reference) by the name of attribute. If the attribute ends with '-ref' suffix then it is considered as reference to other bean.  I though that maybe I would be usefull to have such functionality in AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser itself, but I wasn't sure how this will affect the existing code, so I decided to implement that only in the parser.

This is not a problem when running in a normal servlet container, but poses problems when e.g. creating an executable JAR file from a webapp using an embedded web server such as Jetty, or running GWT in ""Dev Mode"", which uses a custom class loader.  In the former scenario, a typical approach is to use a Maven assembly to extract all .class files from the project dependencies and merge them into one hierarchy, as a way of packaging all the dependencies and the webapp itself into one JAR file.  However, in this case only one copy of ""spring.handlers/schemas/tooling"" can exist, and so any schemas that are used and /not/ in the one copy cannot be validated. This leads to exceptions such as this one:  org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionStoreException: Line 65 in XML document from class path resource [spring/beans.xml] is invalid; nested exception is org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-complex-type.2.4.c: The matching wildcard is strict, but no declaration can be found for element 'context:annotation-config'. at org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.FailFastProblemReporter.error(FailFastProblemReporter.java:68) at org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.ReaderContext.error(ReaderContext.java:85) at org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.ReaderContext.error(ReaderContext.java:76) at org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader.importBeanDefinitionResource(DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader.java:218) at org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader.parseDefaultElement(DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader.java:147)  Other people reporting similar problems can be found at Stack Overflow here and here.  The workaround is to construct your own ""custom"" version of these three files, merging all the copies into one like so:  //IOUtils and FileUtils come from Apache Commons IOfor(String s : new String[] {""spring.schemas"", ""spring.handlers"", ""spring.tooling""}) { Enumeration e = Test.class.getClassLoader().getResources(""META-INF/""+s); StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();while(e.hasMoreElements()) { URL u = (URL) e.nextElement(); out.append(IOUtils.toString(u.openStream())).append(""\n""); } File outf = new File(s); FileUtils.writeStringToFile(outf, out.toString(), ""UTF-8""); }  However, the proper fix would be to use a different file-name for each instance of the schemas/handlers/tooling files. For example, inside ""org.springframework.aop-3.0.5.RELEASE.jar/META-INF"" you would find ""spring-aop.schemas"", ""spring-aop.handlers"" and ""spring-aop.tooling"".  I'm afraid I'm not sufficiently up-to-speed with the Spring code-base to give you a patch to do this, however a brief investigation shows that ""spring.handlers"" and ""spring.schemas"" are specified in org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.PluggableSchemaResolver and DefaultNamespaceHandlerResolver, and that constructors exist for specifying different locations for these files. I hope you find this information useful.

The real problem is: if the same placeholder has been set outside the current configuration file, that value will might found instead of the intended default.

Spring Security is such an example. It has a \ element that sets up three singletons and injects them into other security singletons. Unfortunately, the \ element doesn't let me specify a value for the alwaysRemember property of the AbstractRememberMeServices bean it sets up. Now I have to go and figure out how these three beans are meant to be wired up and translate them to traditional syntax. Worse, I have to translate all schema-based security configuration back to traditional syntax because the FilterChainProxy isn't accessible via schema-based syntax. If you've ever dealt with Spring Security you know what a daunting task that is.  I don't really know how to solve this problem but let's say 1) the bean names used by schema-based config were well-documented and 2) Spring supported the merging of bean definitions (for all beans, not just collections), that would be viable fallback:  ```    ...      ...    ```    --- No further details from [SPR-9091](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-9091?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-03T12:50:18Z","2012-08-15T13:04:09Z"

Both are services, both implement SmartLifecycle. Both have an auto-wired dependency to the other bean. IOW, there is a circular dependency between them. A.getPhase() returns 1, B.getPhase() returns 2. Intuitively, the expected behavior is that A.start() is invoked before B.start(). The actual behavior in 3.0.5 is that B.start() is invoked before A.start().  DefaultLifecycleProcessor attempts to start A first, but before doing so starts all lifecycle beans among A's dependencies first. B is one of those so its start() is actually invoked first.  My take on this is that an injection dependency is not necessarily the same as a lifecycle dependency. Spring's lifecycle processing treats them as the same thing. Bean X may depend on bean Y and yet bean X might have to be started before Y for reasons orthogonal to dependency injection, say concurrency. SmartLifecycle's Javadocs state explicitly that depends-on has priority over phases, yet I feel that overriding getPhase() is a much stronger statement than introducing a bean reference, especially when it is auto-wired, so I would think that getPhase() should overrule depends-on relationships.  I don't see how these two dependency sets can be untangled without breaking backwards compatibility. On the other hand, we could limit the fix to circularly dependent beans: If beans A and B depend on each other but belong to distinct phases, the dependency should be ignored. I'd be willing to supply a patch, if requested.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  1 votes, 1 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2011-12-16T13:48:13Z","2019-01-12T02:36:35Z"

This simply can't work reliably because the substitution could produce a string that is impossible to parse using a regular expression for URLs. For example, the following template  ``` http://foo.com/things/{thingId} ```  with the following value for thingId  ``` a/b ```  produces the following string after substitution  ``` http://foo.com/things/a/b ```  When URIUtil does not encode the / between a and b because it takes the slash literally. This is what I would expect in this case:  ``` http://foo.com/things/a%2Fb ```  The reason we have URL-encoding is so we can embed any string into a URL without breaking it. But we need to encode the embedded string BEFORE we embed it. We can't expect URIUtils to be able to fix a URL that we broke by embedding an unencoded string.  Now, depending on where we embed a string into a URL certain characters loose their special meaning. The slash, for example, has no special meaning in the query part. If we want to produce URLs without redundantly encoded parts, we need to take the context into account. Nevertheless, it is always safe to encode all special characters in each embedded string and that would be a simple fix.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - #13050 UriTemplate doesn't encode query parameters - [INT-2569](https://jira.spring.io/browse/INT-2569) Refactor HttpOutboundGateway to mitigate breaking changes due to UriTemplate changes in Spring 3.1","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-31T19:45:37Z","2019-01-13T21:42:06Z"

This results in the interceptor being applied not only to application beans but also to the Hibernate `SessionFactory`.  If the `beanNames` property of `BeanNameAutoProxyCreator` is changed to something less _greedy_ than ""*"" -- for example, ""*Dao"" -- the `sessionFactory` will not be advised by the method interceptor, and the code will work as expected.  As for why the `SessionFactory` fails to operate as expected when advised by a `MethodInterceptor`, that remains to be determined, but it is assumed that Spring's Hibernate support fails to properly manage the `Session` for the current thread if the `SessionFactory` is hidden behind a dynamic proxy, which is the case when a `MethodInterceptor` is applied to every bean in the application context.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5, 3.1.2","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-23T12:10:50Z","2019-01-13T07:06:07Z"

Now all arguments are converted.  I have a problem with SpEL, where root object is map (but it's a general problem with Map arguments) - it's a problem w Java generics, where type arguments may be deducted from method parameters, but not from actual arguments:  ``` // method void mapArg(Map arg1); // type descriptor for method parameter new TypeDescriptor(MethodParameter.forMethodOrConstructor(methodOrCtor, i)); // type descriptor for actual argument TypeDescriptor.forObject(argument) ```  Spring converts Map because it determines it's Map\, which results in new Map being passed to actual method. When the map is EvaluationContext's root object, it's not the root map which is passed to SpEL invoked method, so I can't use SpEL to fill passed map...  I know it **can't** be resolved because of type erasure - but can this be specified in documentation somehow?  regards Grzegorz Grzybek  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #13356 3.0.6 Map to Map conversion shallow copying maps causing unexpected results on upgrade from 3.0.5","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-07T00:50:49Z","2019-01-11T13:20:08Z"

It's trying to set the actual bean, instead of a provider or an object factory.  I stepped through the code.  The code in the getDependencyType() method of DependencyDescriptor doesn't seem to work as expected when it's setting the value on the second session bean.  Something with the nesting level.  So, I don't get a DependencyProvider as expected in the resolveDependency method of DefaultListableBeanFactory class.

The subset of the OSGi community that uses Spring, which includes the communities surrounding the popular Eclipse Virgo and Gemini Blueprint projects, will be impacted if such support is not put in place or some suitable workaround found.  The particular value of publishing Spring framework bundles to the EBR is that the EBR captures those bundles' transitive dependencies on ""bundleised"" versions of 3rd party libraries such as Hibernate which are present in the EBR. If Spring framework 3.2 bundles are omitted from the EBR, then users will need to resort to educated guesswork to determine the correct ""bundleised"" transitive dependencies.  The purpose of this JIRA is to track the work to implement or work around the issue, but also to raise awareness of the issue among the user community and to encourage discussion.

So it is possible to introduce manifest changes which will prevent Spring framework being used as a drop-in upgrade for earlier versions of Spring. See #13431 for an example of this, which was caught relatively late in the day.  The suggested improvement is to introduce a nightly regression test of the ability to resolve Spring framework with a fixed basic set of non-optional dependencies. The test should probably fire up an OSGi framework such as Eclipse Equinox and install the Spring framework bundles and their non-optional dependencies. After this, the Spring framework bundles should be started and then the test should check that all of those bundles are in ACTIVE state.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 RC1  **Issue Links:** - #13431 New non-optional dependencies in org.springframework.web-3.1.0.RC1.jar","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2011-10-20T03:05:32Z","2019-01-12T02:37:10Z"

I believe this should be changed to allow for null values in the ""object"" side of the conversion. That means modifying the system so that Parsers can return null as the parsed object, and Printers can accept null as the object to be formatted.  This would allow to use null as a valid value, which might be required when interfacing with/building on legacy systems.  Right now, Parsers cannot return null or you'll immediately get a NullPointerException (on the conversion to targetType; see ParserConverter class in FormattingConversionService), while Printers will never be called if the object being formatted is null (see PrinterConverter class in FormattingConversionService).  I believe this specification change to Parser is fully backward compatible. The one to Printer is not (as Printers right now are never called on null), so maybe we could introduce a tag interface ""NullAwarePrinter"" that printers have to implement if they want to be passed null values (if they don't, just fall back to the current behavior).  Note: this is similar to issue #12969; however, #12969 involves only Parsers and the empty string value, and this one really is just an improvement, while the other is a bug (IMHO).  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?101583-Why-does-the-Formatter-system-ignore-null-values  **Issue Links:** - #12969 Formatter subsystem's ParserConverter skips Parser invocation if input string is empty","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-10T08:20:37Z","2019-01-11T12:59:55Z"

(You can see this at the very beginning of the convert() method in ParserConverter).  This mean that you get two different behaviors when receiving data from fields in a form, depending on whether you use or don't use parsers.  1) Suppose you have a String property on your command bean, and a matching input field on the view. Then:  - if the user inputs any non empty string, the form bean property will be set to that string; - if the user inputs an empty string, the form bean property will be set to the empty string.  So far, so good, this is the expected behavior.  2) Now suppose you annotate the String property on your command bean with a Formatter\ annotation with its parse() method implemented.  Then: - if the user inputs any non empty string, the parse() method will get correctly called, and will return whatever is its parsing result. - if the user inputs an empty string, the parse() method will never get called, and moreover the form bean property will be set to null.  This is wrong in my opinion because:  1) Spring is not allowing a Parser to handle empty strings on input, however one might very well want to consider empty strings as lecit value when parsing.  2) from the application point-of-view, using a Parser may result in having your command bean properties set to null... ironically enough, something you should never get as Parsers and Printers supposedly are not allowed to handle null values.  The proposed fix is, simply allow empty string to reach the Parser's parse() method, so that it can eventually handle it.  ---  I'm attaching a sample webapp which shows the problem; the webapp shows a form with two String fields, one not annotated with a Formatter, and the other annotated with a simple `@Trim` formatters which trims strings when parsing and is a no-op when printing.  The form is pre-populated with non empty string; if you submit it, you can see both the Parser and the Printer part of the Formatter getting called on the annotated property (watch the log for this). If you otherwise submit the form with empty fields, you'll see the Parser is never called, and the annotated property is set to null (again, see the log as on the resulting webpage nulls are converted to the empty string).  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?101583-Why-does-the-Formatter-system-ignore-null-values  **Attachments:** - [formatters-test.tar.gz](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18189/formatters-test.tar.gz) (_7.50 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #12973 Formatter subsystem: allow Parser to return null as the parsed object; allow Printers to accept null as the object to be formatted - #12201 Consider mapping empty form values to [null] for Object properties - #12038 Formatters bind empty form fields to [null] property values while DataBinder by default binds empty string","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-10T03:38:42Z","2019-01-13T07:09:25Z"

URIs that differ in the replacement of a reserved character with its corresponding percent-encoded octet are not equivalent.  Percent- encoding a reserved character, or decoding a percent-encoded octet that corresponds to a reserved character, will change how the URI is interpreted by most applications.  Thus, characters in the reserved set are protected from normalization and are therefore safe to be used by scheme-specific and producer-specific algorithms for delimiting data subcomponents within a URI.  The actual URL decoding happens in UrlPathHelper.getLookupPathForRequest which eventually calls getRequestUri which calls decodeAndCleanUriString. This is basically too early. First the handler should be chosen and the PathVariables assigned. Then URL decoding should happen on each of the path variables' values.  If desired I can write a unit test or include a sample Controller to reproduce the above.  **Note:** Tomcat MUST be started with the -Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true option or the request will never even land at the Spring DispatcherServlet.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Issue Links:** - #11616 Decode URI template variables if the AbstractHandlerMethodMapping.setUrlDecode() property is set to false (_**""is duplicated by""**_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/57307a0b2e5bce8f70d5deddf8df11d034dc8c5a  1 votes, 3 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-08T01:51:13Z","2019-01-11T22:26:47Z"

The Bean in this Scope is annotated with: `@Component`(""statusBean"") `@ManagedBean` `@Scope`(""view"")  The bean has an autowired transient member environmentDAO which is not serializable. Everything works fine, when configuring the bean into the session or request scope.  According to the spring 3.0.0 M4 Changelog and a spring 3 presentation movie on the web, Spring 3 Beans in request/session scope automatically get objects inject from the WebapplicationContext if they are unserializable/null because they got lost during serialization.  It looks like it is not possible to do this for custom scoped beans.  I tried to configure the dao with an \ element and used scoped-proxy=""interfaces/targetClass"" from component-scan.  I gave a session-listener which implements HttpSessionActivationListener a try without sucess (sessionDidActivate is never called).

BUT, you defined each property in separated properties file and loaded these files using different PropertyPlaceholderConfigurers, i.e., one bean configuration for each properties file, that placeholder will not be replaced.  This happens because inside the framework, it processes the bean definitions iterating over the PPCs defined first. And each PPCs has its own properties file. So, when the PPC that has defined the Environment property is visited, only the ${Environment} placeholder will be replaced. And the method ""Object resolveValue(Object value)"" inside the BeanDefinitionVisitor class will return the original placeholder ${${Environment}.JndiProviderURL}, instead of ${Dev.JndiProviderURL}. (Environment=Dev)  The main problem happens inside the method ""String parseStringValue(..)"" of PropertyPlaceholderHelper class. The first placeholder ${Environment} will be replaced, but the second one ${Dev.JndiProviderURL} will be not. Because that property is defined in other properties file loaded by other PPC. The propVal on line 146 will be null and the method will return the original placeholder, instead of ${Dev.JndiProviderURL}.

However when to access RequestContext, which is used by Spring VM macros (defined in spring.vm) or custom toolbox, it is unable to merge the model from the current Request attributes, which has already been populated by previous `@Controller` handler before entering VelocityView as the result of RequestDispatcher.include().  1.

Note it set the current model in RequestContext to null to cheat RequestContext to get model object from request attributes.

However, when working in a clustered environment, we have found that variables defined as part of the `@SessionAttribute` annotation are not populated from the HttpSession when the server instance fails over to a different server in the cluster.  It looks like the org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.support.HandlerMethodInvoker calls the getActualSessionAttributeNames() method of the HandlerMethodResolver in order to get a list of all session attributes/variables that should be placed into the Model.  The issue, however, is that the Set used to store the names (actualSessionAttributeNames) is not populated during the init of HandlerMethodResolver.  It is only populated as the HandlerMethodResolver.isSessionAttribute method is called which doesn't happen until AFTER the call to the getActualSessionAttributeNames() is made by the HandlerMethodInvoker.  This is resulting in the SessionAttribute values being re-initialized and the loss of all conversational data for the Controller.  We have temporarily gotten around this issue by modifying the HandlerMethodResolver code  to have it add all session attribute names to the actualSessionAttributeNames during the init (around line 107 in the HandlerMethodResolver code).  We have not found any other solution and most forums/posts/blogs/examples suggest using the WebRequest or HttpSession objects directly.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Attachments:** - [ErikController.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19330/ErikController.java) (_1.46 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-23T12:20:40Z","2012-06-19T03:39:05Z"

So if I execute the following sequence of requests:  ``` Group g1 = getGroup(""1000""); Group g2 = getGroup(""2000""); Group g3 = getGroup(""random_invalid_id_which_isnt_even_in_the_database""); ```  In the above case, g1, g2, and g3 will all be the exact same object which is the first group fetched (the one with id of ""1000"").  If I change, the method declaration as follows:  ``` @Cacheable(value = Group.Cache.NAME, key=""#id"") Group getGroup(String id); ```  I get the following error when trying to use the method:  ``` java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Null key returned for cache definition (maybe you are using named params on classes without debug info?)

Or if there could be something else going on here?  Obviously the issue having debug symbols available for method parameters is not an issue because when i change ""id"" to ""groupId"" it works.  Also, I cut a little bit out of my original declaration of this method just to keep the description more succinct, there are other annotations on this method as well but I didn't think those would affect things, but just in case, here is the method verbatim as it is declared on the interface:  ``` @WebMethod(operationName = ""getGroup"") @WebResult(name = ""group"") @Cacheable(value = Group.Cache.NAME, key=""'id=' + #id"") Group getGroup(@WebParam(name=""id"") String id) throws RiceIllegalArgumentException; ```  If you need more info, javadoc can be found here:  http://site.kuali.org/rice/2.0.0-m9-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/org/kuali/rice/kim/api/group/GroupService.html    ---  **Affects:** 3.1 RC1  1 votes, 5 watchers","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-10-12T08:00:37Z","2019-01-11T14:06:56Z"

In working through the problem I created a small sample application that demonstrates the issue.  The sample project is using a WebApplicationInitializer so a Servlet 3.0 runtime environment is required.  I have included a relevant post from the forum thread this was created in response of.  ""I have spent some time trying to create a simple project that would expose the issue I was having. In doing so, I finally figured out what was causing me the issues. Basically, during a prototyping session the controller under question was doing some direct manipulation of the session factory, and a `@Transactional` annotation was added to the controller.  In the mvc:annotation-driven branch, I use two main contexts, one that is loaded through the context loader listener and scans non-controller components and a context that is associated to the dispatcher servlet that scans for controller components so I imagine the transaction annotation didn't conflict with it. In looking at the logs during initialization this branch uses the actual class and not a proxy when mapping the url to the method.  In the java configuration branch, I based the configurations off of the Greenhouse sample application, which scanned all of the components (controller and non-controller) in the same application context that was associated with the context loader listener. The dispatcher servlet was given an empty context. In this branch, the transaction annotation caused the initialization to map the url to the proxy created by the transaction annotation scanning (I would presume). I would assume that if I had created two contexts as I did in the xml configuration it would work fine. I have also confirmed that removing the `@Transactional` from the controller fixed the issues I was having.  At this point I have not created a JIRA entry for this because I assumed I would get some combination of 1) why would you want to do this or 2) create two contexts if you insist on doing this.  If you would still like me to create a ticket, I would be happy to, and I have a small sample application that shows the problem for troubleshooting purposes.""   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?110593-mvc-interceptors-behavior-change-between-3.1.0.M1-and-3.1.0.M2  **Attachments:** - [m2java.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18351/m2java.zip) (_21.24 kB_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/a7ff8a2efaf5b30399066715fa1a6762814d6e7f, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/40fb1b21e1ae3e802c2e9326afd81e6642c6ee59","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-17T06:29:04Z","2012-06-19T03:39:46Z"

For a test class named `MyTests` this requires the default configuration class to be named `MyTests$ContextConfiguration` (i.e., that it be a static inner class named `ContextConfiguration`).  #### Goal  `AnnotationConfigContextLoader` should use reflection to inspect all inner classes defined within the test class that is annotated with `@ContextConfiguration` and consider any inner class that meets the following criteria to be a default configuration class:  - not private - not final - static - annotated with `@Configuration`  #### Original Description  Suggestion to enhance `AnnotationConfigContextLoader` to support wildcards for the default `@Configuration` look-up rules.  The semantics would be that any class that matches that wildcard AND has an `@Configuration` annotation could be picked up.  As a further suggestion, change the default resource suffix pattern to ""$*"" -- this would satisfy the 'convention over configuration' but also give some naming flexibility to users.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #10852 Provide TestContext support for `@Configuration` classes","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-03T06:49:48Z","2019-01-13T07:09:05Z"

COMMENT and ENTITY_REFERENCE events use a different class and fail the isCharacters() check in the existing code:  ``` public String getText() {     if (event.isCharacters()) {         return event.asCharacters().getData();     }     else {         throw new IllegalStateException();     } } ```  The following will not fail and is much closer to correct than the existing implementation though as the TODO notes it is still not 100% correct as getText must return resolved entity references. I feel like this fallback approach is at least a decent default and first pass at getting this issue fixed.  ``` public String getText() {     if (event.isCharacters()) { //Handles CHARACTERS, CDATA, & SPACE         return event.asCharacters().getData();     }     else if (event.getEventType() == XMLEvent.COMMENT) {         return ((Comment) event).getText();     }     else if (event.getEventType() == XMLEvent.ENTITY_REFERENCE) {         //TODO this should be the replacement value, not sure how to resolve that         return ((EntityReference) event).getName();     }     else {         throw new IllegalStateException();     } } ```  This bug is a problem for any use of the XMLEventStreamReader where a comment exists in the parsed document.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/3a332e556cd05c0bee7dcd7f1f1a556d371e3567, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7c504853cdce0379b5282ec5bd869cc738f44e95","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-15T23:01:33Z","2012-06-19T03:39:31Z"

In detail I'm having URL that I want to ask using RestTemplate. Url is the following [CODE]API=http://server/path?key=...&url={url}[/CODE] where {url} is variable that is passed from the outside. Url that is passed in can be any valid URL with query string or not. Then I call [CODE]this.rest.getForObject(API, String.class, url)[/CODE] that call API mentioned above and passed incoming URL into.  And here is what I see. When I pass unencoded url into REST call UriUtils does nothing so I get more parameters then I need because own url parameters are just appended to API parameters. When I do manual encoding first I get double encoded parameter that is also invalid.  I found the code and it definitely works that way, but I'm not sure why already encoded parameters are forced to be double encoded.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?111473-UriUtils-does-double-encode  **Issue Links:** - #13050 UriTemplate doesn't encode query parameters","closed","status: declined,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-03T02:23:18Z","2019-01-12T16:25:23Z"

The test application context should create a mock version of the bean, e.g. by means of `IMocksControl.createMock()`.  #### Current Approach  The test application context defines:  ```xml     	   ```  The drawback of this approach is that the given service can no longer be autowired with `@Autowired MyService myService`, but it can be injected with `@Resource`.  #### Analysis  The reason that the mock cannot be autowired by type is that the parametrized return type of the method configured via `factory-method` is not currently honored by Spring in all cases (i.e., depending on the order in which beans are defined in the context). In other words, the returned bean is not a candidate for autowiring by type for the type `T` (i.e., `org.company.api.MyService` in this example).  For a succinct discussion of this behavior, see the _Explanation_ and _Alternative solution_ sections of the _[Spring Integration Tests, Part I, Creating Mock Objects](http://www.jayway.com/2011/11/30/spring-integration-tests-part-i-creating-mock-objects/)_ blog post.  Note that this is a general limitation of using `factory-method` in Spring; this is not specific to testing or mocks.

For both maps, the method ensures that it maps the singleton bean name to a `LinkedHashSet` (will be added, if not present) and that this set contains the dependent prototype bean name. A `synchronized` block guards both map manipulations, leading to contention and a severe performance bottleneck under high load.  Since both maps are already `ConcurrentHashMaps`, the map manipulation may be refactored to be non-blocking. The following suggestion for `dependentBeanMap` applies in the same way to `dependenciesForBeanMap`. It may also be applied to some other `ConcurrentHashMap` manipulations in `DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry`, however those are not as performance-critical.  ``` // change type of field from Map to ConcurrentMap private final ConcurrentMap dependentBeanMap = new ConcurrentHashMap();  public void registerDependentBean(String beanName, String dependentBeanName) {   String canonicalName = canonicalName(beanName);   getMappedSet(dependentBeanMap, canonicalName).add(dependentBeanName);   getMappedSet(dependenciesForBeanMap, dependentBeanName).add(canonicalName); }  private Set getMappedSet(ConcurrentMap map, String name) {   // a simple putIfAbsent would be enough to be functionally correct,   // but calling get first will avoid creation of the set in the common case that a mapping already exists    Set set = map.get(name);   return set != null ? set : map.putIfAbsent(name, Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet(8))); } ```  After the change the set will be synchronized, but contention on the contained sets will be much lower than on a global map lock.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - #12621 Improve failure mode when depends-on cycles exist - #16722 Remove synchronization around filteredPropertyDescriptorsCache in case of non-existing entry  3 votes, 6 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-02T13:03:37Z","2019-01-11T14:40:46Z"

[SPR-8626]","**[David Wolff](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=elameno)** opened **[SPR-8626](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8626?redirect=false)** and commented  I have a web setup where I am using JSR-303 validation logic with a custom JDBC Message Source that permits caching with a specified cache invalidation/refresh interval.  The LocalValidatorFactoryBean instantiates a MessageInterpolator that provides caching of its own that does not have any cache invalidation timing parameters and, as such, it overrides any settings that are in my MessageSource.  What I've done to fix the issue is to subclass the LocalValidatorFactoryBean and have added a boolean cacheMessages property which then gets passed on through to the constructor of the ResourceBundleMessageInterpolator.  This permits me to turn off caching at the MessageInterpolator level and utilize the caching that is available in my MessageSource implementation.  It would be nice to have the cacheMessages option added directly into the LocalValidatorFactoryBean so I no longer have to utilize a subclass in my own packages.  I've attached an example of what I've done if you care to update the factory bean.  Many Thanks!

Here is the particular case that I've been fussing with today to little avail, setting preemptive authentication (i.e. send basic authentication headers by default rather than performing 2 requests to authenticate):  http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/authentication.html#d4e1023  The problem being that the RestTemplate implementation as it is has no support for setting HttpContext parameters (the template calls the Http.execute(HttpUriRequest) which uses only the non-accessible default HttpContext), there aren't any good ways to set the default context parameters on the HttpClient in 4.x Apache HTTP Components. You end up needing to extend HttpClient to provide for default HttpContext params on the HttpClient object and the whole thing just becomes a spaghetti mess from there making the template more pain than pleasure.   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/f9144ea1eae5b09b3f8609dec0e6343f35c887a9  3 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-24T00:38:25Z","2012-06-19T03:39:15Z"

Note the lack of quotes around the profile value part.  The program flow is:  The MediaType is parsed from the HTTP Accept header with the value  application/xhtml+xml;profile=""http://www.wapforum.org/xhtml""  Note - The inclusion of the quotes means that this value does not trigger the checkToken(String) method of MediaType.  In the StringHttpMessageConverter write method, a call is made to set the content type for the outputMessage. This uses the toString() method of MediaType to set the Content-Type header, this results in the value being set to ""application/xhtml+xml;profile=http://www.wapforum.org/xhtml"".  Next the writeInternal method of StringHttpMessageConverter is called, this tries to get the MediaType for the outputMessage by calling outputMessage.getHeaders().getContentType(), which in turn calls MediaType.parseMediaType(value) with the value of ""application/xhtml+xml;profile=http://www.wapforum.org/xhtml"", due to the missing quotes in the profile parameter value, this will now trigger the checkToken(String) method of MediaType which ultimately results in the IllegalArgumentException being thrown.  ---  Example request headers  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/xhtml+xml; profile=""http://www.wapforum.org/xhtml"", application/vnd.wap.xhtml+xml Accept-Language: en-us Host: app.example.com Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.4  **Issue Links:** - #14368 Allow parsing of media types with single-quotes (_**""is depended on by""**_) - #13781 Invalid MIME-type causes a 500 error  1 votes, 7 watchers","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-12-13T09:22:17Z","2019-01-13T21:41:22Z"

Karr](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dkarr)** opened **[SPR-8764](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8764?redirect=false)** and commented  The forum note I wrote describes the situation, but I'll recap it here in a different way.  I have an app that uses ""jee:jndi-lookup"".  It normally runs in WebLogic, which has configuration settings to bind JNDI paths to datasources.  This works fine in the container.  I have integration tests that use SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.  In order for this to work, I have to use a ""pre"" context that uses ""DriverManagerDataSource"" and binds those datasources to JNDI (I wrote a simple ""JNDIBinder"" class that does this).  Unfortunately, I need more than just the Spring context changes to get this to work.  When I specify the `@ContextConfiguration` annotation, I can give it the ""pre"" context, and then the regular application context, in that order, but that doesn't mean that the ""pre"" context will be entirely initialized before Spring attempts to process the ""jee:jndi-lookup"" element.  In fact, what I see happen is that Spring reports errors on the ""jee:jndi-lookup"" elements, because my JNDI binder hasn't been initialized by the time Spring processes the ""jee:jndi-lookup"" element.  What I ended up having to do is have a ""`@BeforeClass`"" method that manually loads the ""pre"" context, and then manually calls the ""init()"" function on my JNDIBinder class (just loading the ""pre"" context didn't appear to make this happen).  What I'm suggesting in this recommendation, without specifying exactly how you would make this happen, is to allow the developer to specify a list of contexts that are entirely loaded and initialized before the ""regular"" context list is loaded and initialized.  This would likely be an additional list attribute on the `@ContextConfiguration` annotation.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.6  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?115434-Would-it-be-useful-if-SpringJUnit4ClassRunner-had-a-quot-pre-quot-context&p=382183#post382183","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-10-12T10:03:06Z","2014-07-21T11:49:29Z"

It is a right pain to add these classes manually to the ""classesToBeBound"" property in the Jaxb2Marshaller. Given that other components (I'm looking at you Hibernate : AnnotationSessionFactoryBean) have the ability to automatically add classes from packages that match annotations, why not then for the Jaxb2Marshaller (having to key in the classes manually is **so** old skool).  I've extended Jaxb2Marshaller (file attached) that scans on the classpath for appropriately annotated classes. Please do review and I hope that this can be incorporated into the next release. I'm happy to make changes to the codebase if required to bring it up to Spring coding standards.  It's a pity that afterPropertiesSet is marked as Final in Jaxb2Marshaller since I can't override that method to set up the setClassesToBeBound before then calling the super afterPropertiesSet. Currently as the code stands, I have to provide a dummy setClassesToBeBound and setLazyInit to be true. This dummy is then replaced by overriding the getJaxbContext. I think this needs rewriting.

We have an issue that during development time, it would be neat if the cache was disabled via a spring property. This is not exposed on EhCacheFactoryBean. I propose this:  A new setter on EhCacheFactoryBean called ""setDisabled"" which takes a boolean, then in createCache() set the cache to be disabled if the property is set.  This would fit nicely into the environment configuration where one configuration would have setDisabled to true during development (in a development environment configuration).   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-01T08:20:04Z","2012-06-19T03:39:21Z"

I have an object with an ""options"" field and a ""getOptions()"" method but no corresponsing ""setOptions()"" method. Fair enough, it isn't a bean :)  However, I just wanted to log the fact that the behaviour has recently changed and maybe to help someone else out who's seeing the same error.  A reasonable workaround is to switch to the MethodInvokingFactoryBean and specify ""getOptions"" as the method name. Unfortunatly, this isn't quite as elegant as I would hope because I have 2 levels of beans to navigate. The original spring config was:                               Note the ""options.applicationId"" meaning ""the applicationId property inside the options bean"".

N.B. it works if the preferred media type is one that leads to an HTML view (so browser clients generally don't notice), but machine and command line clients do not work because they get a 200 instead of a 302.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/37d22ad039790985ccb8f751fcd2a2aec159e5ca","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-12T00:51:06Z","2012-06-19T03:39:26Z"

The problem is that I have multiple JPA persistence units in my application (i.e. multiple independent persistence.xml files), and if I update my Spring config to take advantage of this new auto-scan functionality, I get an exception when two different persistence.xml files map two classes with the same (unqualified) class name. The reason is that Hibernate is trying to perform its own `@Entity` scanning, even after Spring has already scanned.  Looking at the code, I see that DefaultPersistenceUnitManager.buildDefaultPersistenceUnitInfo() (which does some of the Spring `@Entity` scanning work) appears to try to exclude unlisted classes by calling SpringPersistenceUnitInfo.excludeUnlistedClasses(). However, this method is actually a poorly named getter, although it would be easy to confuse it with something equivalent to setExcludeUnlistedClasses(true). I suspect that this line was actually intended to tell the JPA provider to exclude unlisted classes, but it ends up being a no-op.   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e0231438cdfa75bcbd34bae28765e2afcb0c4121, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/01036f0ff5876be996affda71ad4c721f3ee92a5","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-12-15T13:21:40Z","2012-06-19T03:39:10Z"

These annotations could perform these configuration tasks ""underneath"", hiding their complexities to Spring users, in the same way namespace handlers can in an XML file.  `@PropertySource` is the clear example to this, as it registers a PropertySource for the specified "".properties"" files, but the object registered is of a specific class hard-coded into Spring's code. This avoids the possibility of creating instances of other implementations of the PropertySource interface that perform more complex processing of .properties entries.  Specifically, the jasypt project [ http://www.jasypt.org ] --of which I'm author-- defines an ""encryption"" XML namespace which allows developers to register an EncryptablePropertySource that performs automatic transparent decryption of properties with """", which works in a way equivalent to """", but applying transparent decryption.  I would love to be able to offer this same easiness of configuration in `@Configuration` classes with an `@EncryptablePropertySource` annotation, but as it happens this is not possible :-(  Please, extend the `@Configuration` mechanism for allowing custom annotations (with their associated handlers).

This makes sense and is OK.  But the problem is that the PropertySource object for the local properties (those coming from the ""location"" attribute and also from the ""properties"" property) is being created like this:  PropertySource localPropertySource = new PropertiesPropertySource(LOCAL_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME, this.mergeProperties());  ...whereas in the original ""postProcessBeanFactory"" method in PropertyResourceConfigurer these merged properties are post-processed by executing the ""convertProperties"" method:  Properties mergedProps = mergeProperties(); // Convert the merged properties, if necessary. convertProperties(mergedProps); // Let the subclass process the properties. processProperties(beanFactory, mergedProps);  This means that the new PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer class never calls ""convertProperties"", and so disables one of the extension mechanisms of the old pre-3.1 PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer class: overriding the ""convertProperty(...)"" and ""convertPropertyValue(...)"" methods.

This issue does not exist in 3.1.0.RC1. From 3.1.0.RC1 to 3.1.0.RC2, there was a change to SpringValidatorAdapter.validate(Object,Errors) that seems to be one/the source of this problem.  Attached is an Eclipse/Maven project that demonstrates the issue.  The pom.xml file has two profiles one for 3.1.0RC1 and one for 3.1.0.RC2.  There are two Eclipse launch configurations defined that invoke Maven with one or the other profile active.  Maven will start up Jetty and then run a single Selenium test that provides two different ""passwords"" for a ""new user page"".  A ""`@Matches`"" validator will be called to compare these two values and will return ""false"" because they are different.  The current logic seems to treat this as a ""binding failure"" and associates the Bean instance (the value being validated) with the ""confirmationPassword"" field as its ""invalid value.""  The conversion service later tries to convert the Bean to a String, the type of the field, which causes the IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 RC2  **Attachments:** - [RC2Bug.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/19194/RC2Bug.zip) (_46.29 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #13276 NumberFormatException caused by property paths from JSR-303 based validation with no index into a collection  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/aedccec67efc5512d0e39f5c888dc876625e2d4f","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-12-05T11:57:22Z","2019-01-11T15:06:48Z"

This is due to the following code in TypeConverterDelegate:  ```java PropertyEditor editor = this.propertyEditorRegistry.findCustomEditor(requiredType, propertyName);  		// No custom editor but custom ConversionService specified? 		ConversionService conversionService = this.propertyEditorRegistry.getConversionService(); 		if (editor == null && conversionService != null && convertedValue != null) { 			TypeDescriptor sourceTypeDesc = TypeDescriptor.forObject(convertedValue); 			TypeDescriptor targetTypeDesc = typeDescriptor.forElementType(requiredType); 			if (conversionService.canConvert(sourceTypeDesc, targetTypeDesc)) { 				return (T) conversionService.convert(convertedValue, sourceTypeDesc, targetTypeDesc); 			} 		} ```  The above code prefers a property editor over a conversion service so the StringTrimmerEditor is being selected rather than the Wrapped Formatter object.  According to Keith in ##12201, we need to create a custom EmptyStringToNull converter, We did this, registered it with the conversion service instead of the StringTrimmerEditor and got slightly different behavior.  At this point we now have the backing bean field being populated with the string ""null"". It turns out this is because the WebDataBinder has String[] as input and therefore ArrayToStringConverter (which delegates to CollectionToStringConverter) gets called.  CollectionToStringConverter loops over collection elements, converts each to a string and concatanates them together as shown below:  ```java StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder(); int i = 0; for (Object sourceElement : sourceCollection) {   if (i > 0) {     string.append(DELIMITER);   }   Object targetElement = this.conversionService.convert(       sourceElement, sourceType.getElementTypeDescriptor(sourceElement), targetType);   string.append(targetElement);   i++; } return string.toString(); ```  StringBuilder.append takes the null value returned from the custom converter and appends it as ""null"".  We are not quite sure how to proceed at this point. It seems that maybe the CollectionToStringConverter should check the length of the input collection (always 1 for single fields and have alternate behavior). Or it should check the return value of the converter and if null not append it. (and maybe return null if all elements converted to null).  Is there a better place to handle all of this. (extend WebRequestDataBinder?)  Thanks  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.6","closed","in: web,","spring-projects-issues","2011-12-20T09:51:43Z","2019-01-11T14:32:37Z"

The first exception that happens gets handled correctly, whereas the next different type of exception throws it's own exception as the incorrect method is selected.  I traced this down to the ExceptionDepthComparator class incorrectly ordering the collection of possibilities.  This seems to happen in a couple of scenarios but most importantly when the exception is exactly the same as the method contains vs something not in the hierarchy at all.  I saw #11745 changed the compare class of ExceptionDepthComparator from depth2-depth1 to depth1-depth2 but when one of the exceptions being compared is not in the hierarchy is still returned -1.  This caused incorrect ordering as it things -1 is the lowest depth and as such should be moved to the top.  I changed this to a high number and all my tests then passed.

The following is not possible in bash:  ``` $ spring.profiles.active=p1,p2 java -classpath ... MyApplication ```  As bash does not support '.' in variable names:  ``` -bash: spring.profiles.active=p1,p2: command not found ```  This means that it is currently not possible to set active or default profiles via the system environment if one is using bash.  Nor is it possible to use the system environment for resolution of any other user-defined property using the `PropertySource`/`Environment` API developed as part of Spring 3.1.  Note that this **is** possible under other shells, such as tcsh:  ``` % setenv spring.profiles.active p1,p2 % java -classpath ... MyApplication ```  There are several possible solutions, the simplest of which would be to change the property name from `spring.profiles.active` to `spring_profiles_active` or something similar that bash does not take issue with.  However, this is undesirable, because it suggests that _all_ properties to be resolved through the `PropertySource` mechanism should avoid '.' characters.  This goes strongly against convention in java, where such naming is common (think about .properties files here.  This 'solution' would also have the negative effect of breaking all existing applications running against 3.1 milestones and release candidates at this point, as well as all documentation and blog post that have been written about profile support and it's activation mechanisms.  Therefore, the better solution is probably to provide custom support at the environment property source level, allowing for interchangeability of '.' and '_' characters.  This would allow for the following:  ``` $ spring_profiles_active=p1,p2 java -classpath ... MyApplication ```  as well as the following  ``` $ java -Dspring.profiles.active=p1,p2 -classpath ... MyApplication ```  This would apply generally, such that a call to resolve property `foo.bar`, e.g.:  ``` env.getProperty(""foo.bar"") ```  would return non-null assuming that the `Environment` object `env` contains a system environment `PropertySource` and there is an environment variable present named `foo.bar` or `foo_bar`.  In the rare case that both variables `foo.bar` and `foo_bar` are present in the environment (possible under tcsh, for example), then the variable matching the original request will be the one returned.  That is, a call to `getProperty(""foo.bar"")` will return the value of `foo.bar`, and a call to `getProperty(""foo_bar"")` will return the value of `foo_bar`.  Appropriate debug logging will be added to inform the user when this is occurring.  It may also make sense to allow for case-insensitivity when resolving properties against the system environment `PropertySource`, which will allow for more idiomatic invocation, e.g.:  ``` SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=p1,p2 java -classpath ... MyApplication ```  Javadoc will be updated to reflect these changes at the appropriate locations.   ---  **Reference URL:** http://blog.springsource.org/2011/02/14/spring-3-1-m1-introducing-profile/#comment-223530  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/143db0d8de9d7b46e5de93323afa7a97152ac37c, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/06d06d4aa94d9025ea7416110bff270eb8a632f3  1 votes, 1 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-11-22T12:01:30Z","2012-06-19T03:39:47Z"

"","13164","Support injection of collection-typed beans using @Autowired+@Qualifier or @Inject+@Named  [SPR-8519]","**[Chris Beams](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=cbeams)** opened **[SPR-8519](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8519?redirect=false)** and commented  _A number of issues (see linked issues) have been brought up over time regarding confusion about how to use annotation-based injection for Spring beans that implement `java.util.Collection`.  This issue aims to provide a single and definitive place to address these concerns._  Consider a Spring bean ""fooList"" of type `java.util.List` (but could be any bean ultimately implementing `java.util.Collection`):  ``` @Bean public List fooList() {     List fooList = new ArrayList();     fooList.add(new Foo(1));     fooList.add(new Foo(2));     return fooList; } ```  And consider a Spring `@Component` ""fooService"" that depends on this collection. It is natural to imagine using `@Autowired` or `@Inject` to express the dependency:  ``` @Component public class FooService {     private List fooList;      @Autowired     public setFooList(List fooList) {         this.fooList = fooList;     } } ```  This configuration will fail with an exception similar to the following:  ``` org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of  type [Foo] found for dependency [collection of Foo]: expected at least 1 bean which  qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: {} ```  The reason for this is that when injecting an object of type `List`, `@Autowired` expects one or more **individual** Spring beans of type `Foo` to exist in the container.  Any such beans are added to a new list of type `Foo` and injected.  Therefore, the `@Autowired` method signature above could be read as ""Please collect all Spring beans of type `Foo` into a `List` and inject that list into my `setFooList` setter method"".  These semantics are at odds with the actual intent in the situation above, which reads more like: ""Please find and inject the Spring bean of type `List` into my `setFooList` setter method"".  The situation is often complicated by the fact that asking to inject the Spring bean of type `List` is meaningless at runtime due to type erasure in Java generics.  For this reason, it makes sense to try to qualify the bean by name, as below:  ``` @Component public class FooService {     private List fooList;      @Autowired     public setFooList(@Qualifier(""fooList"") List fooList) {         this.fooList = fooList;     } } ```  Unfortunately, the effect is the same, rendering an exception similar to the following:  ``` org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of  type [Foo] found for dependency [collection of Foo]: expected at least 1 bean which  qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations:  {@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier(value=fooList)} ```  Again, this is due to the semantics of `@Autowired` collections, as described above.  Note that in the examples above, Spring's `@Autowired` is interchangeable with JSR-330's `@Inject`, as is Spring's `@Qualifier` with JSR-330's `@Named`.  They are processed by the same code and thus have the same semantics with regard to collection injection.  This issue then, addresses the common request to provide support for injecting beans of type `java.util.Collection` using `@Autowired`+`@Qualifier` and/or `@Inject`/`@Named` as described above.  ---  **Issue Links:** - #9170 Doc: `@Autowired` does not support Collection and Map as actual bean types - #9713 can't `@autowire` collections - #11443 NoSuchBeanDefinitionException autowiring to collection with no matching types - #12332 `@Qualifier` fails to resolve Lists containing enumerated types (_**""supersedes""**_) - #12454 Cannot `@Autowired` java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue (_**""supersedes""**_) - #12885 Unable to inject `@Named` list (_**""supersedes""**_) - #8626 `@Autowire` does not work as expected for Collections based Repository implementation (_**""supersedes""**_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-07T17:43:40Z","2019-01-13T07:08:28Z"

My own testing on GlassFish suggested the same behavior, but obviously the reporter here is seeing the opposite behavior.  Per the Javadoc for ServletContainerInitializer, the set will be null if no classes matching `@HandlesType` are found, and that's what we're seeing here.

Good question.  You can do it through the Environment API as well.  Technically, you can do it at any point in the lifecycle, but it would be most correct to do it pre-refresh().  There is a convenience issue here, in that the ConfigurableEnvironment interface exposes a `ConversionService getConversionService();` method, but does not expose a method returning a ConverterRegistry.  This means that the user would need to cast:  ((ConverterRegistry)env.getConversionService()).addConverter(FooConverter.class);  We can certainly consider making that more convenient.    ---  **Attachments:** - [mylyn-context.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18302/mylyn-context.zip) (_2.91 kB_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/8227cb624308e68c34cc2140ea63e8fc4f5cbd9f","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-01T22:11:14Z","2012-06-19T03:39:31Z"

Consider introducing a `ValuePostProcessor` mechanism that would allow for this, where (possibly `Ordered`) VPP instances are registered against the `Environment` (via its `PropertyResolver` interface) at context bootstrap time and then act as visitors on any calls to `#getProperty` methods.  VPPs would be invoked **prior** to type conversion via the `Environment`'s built-in `ConversionService` for methods where the latter is applicable.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Issue Links:** - #12962 Provide `@Configuration` support for PropertySource registration (`@PropertySource`)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-05-25T01:19:38Z","2019-01-13T07:09:13Z"

For example:  ``` package one;  @Configuration @ComponentScan(""two"") public class ConfigOne { } ```  ``` package two;  @Configuration @ComponentScan(""three"") public class ConfigTwo { } ```  ``` package three;  @Component public class MyComponent { } ```  Under Spring 3.1 M1, the following behavior will occur:  ``` package bootstrap;  public class Bootstrap {     public static void main(String... args) {         AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();         ctx.register(ConfigOne.class);         ctx.refresh();          ctx.getBean(ConfigOne.class); // success         ctx.getBean(ConfigTwo.class); // success - 1st level @ComponentScan processed         ctx.getBean(MyComponent.class); // fails - 2nd level @ComponentScan not processed     } } ```  Once the recursion logic is complete, it will also be important to detect and prevent cycles in scanned packages, e.g. `@ComponentScan`(""one"")=>`@ComponentScan`(""two"")=>`@ComponentScan`(""one"").

In short, `WagonRepositoryConnector` will call `.addTransferListener()` with `null`, even if aether has not been configured to use a listener.  This is unfortunate, but apparently intentional, given the standard [`TransferListenerSupport` implementation](http://maven.apache.org/wagon/wagon-provider-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/wagon/events/TransferEventSupport.html#addTransferListener(org.apache.maven.wagon.events.TransferListener)), which allows `addXXXListener` calls to be made with `null` arguments without consequence.  The solution would be to either match the null-safe behaviour of aether's `TransferListenerSupport`, or, surely even better, just reuse the `AbstractWagon` implementation from wagon-provider-api rather than maintaining your own.   ---  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/aws-maven/commit/af8823480f854f232ec4a549feafa052a5686913","closed","status: invalid,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-21T09:29:31Z","2019-01-12T05:29:07Z"

In my project I have a requirement to run using the java security manager. I am starting tomcat with the -security option. I granted all permissions to all 3rd party libraries, including spring.  First problem was found in HtmlCharacterEntityReferences when this class loads HtmlCharacterEntityReferences.properties. This is because the loading is not performed within a privileged block, requiring my code to also have access to that properties file. I have fixed this by modifying and recompiling the class (attached patch). I simply wrapped the part that loads the properties file in a privileged block.  There are other reflection related problems which I solved by granting the following permissions to my war file:  grant codeBase ""file:${catalina.base}/webapps/mywebapp/-"" { permission java.lang.RuntimePermission ""getClassLoader""; permission java.lang.RuntimePermission ""accessDeclaredMembers""; permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission ""suppressAccessChecks""; };  However this is not ideal as only spring itself requires these permissions.  I have attached the relevant exceptions. There needs to be some privileged blocks, but since i am not too familiar with the spring web and aop code, I'm not 100% sure where these should be. Definitely not in the classes ReflectionUtils and ClassUtils as that would enable curcumventing permission checking by directly using the utilities.  I can provide a simple demo application and tomcat configuration to replicate these if required.

This is problematic in many cases:  - methods with similar signature - foo(int, String), foo(int, List)  - if the 2nd argument is null they will get mixed - methods with the same signature in different classes, using the same cache - they will get mixed - is there a collision resolution mechanism? If not, things will randomly fail. Rarely, but they will. Imagine that the arguments of two distinct methods (that use the same cache region) evaluate to the same hashcode (not unlikely) - they will override each other's values, and possibly a ClassCastException will occur on retrieval  What is in the first place the reason to get the hashcodes? The underlying cache mechanism is a hashtable of some sort, so it will calculate the hash of the key anyway. But it will have a collision-resolution strategy, unlike the KeyGenerator.  I suggest:  - concatenating the string representations of primitives, and the hashcode of non-primitives. - adding the class name and method name to the key - optionally, where non-primitive values are used as keys, log a warning - this is usually wrong, as the hashcode will change even though the values inside the object are the same  ---  **Attachments:** - [TestDefaultKeyGenerator.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/20806/TestDefaultKeyGenerator.java) (_2.01 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #14870 Cacheable key collision with DefaultKeyGenerator (_**""duplicates""**_) - #14870 Cacheable key collision with DefaultKeyGenerator - #14013 org.springframework.cache.interceptor.DefaultKeyGenerator has too weak hashing functionality  9 votes, 11 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-18T11:20:18Z","2019-01-11T22:21:29Z"

The problem is that once you go outside the standard use-case (and that happens in practically all of the projects I've used that), you have to drop the namespace and define all beans manually, one by one. Which would not be that bad, if it was mentioned anywhere in the documentation how to do that. Now you have to go the the XBeanDefinitionParser, read the code and see what beans are being registered, and what properties they are initialized with. And that code is not the nicest one to read. Plus - this defeats the whole purpose of having a one-tag-to-configure-the-basics. Because it makes you stuck with the basics only, rather than allowing you to built ontop of that. (I know there is at least an issue about mvc:annotation-driven that requests the option to customize a XHandlerAdapter). Another thing is - it is hard to debug once you happen to have a number of beans with names #0 that you haven't registered and don't know anything about (well, I agree you should know where they come from, but you can't override just that particular one - you have to override all). All that leads to questions like this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3693397/howto-get-rid-of-mvcannotation-driven/3694059  How to improve that - I don't know exactly, but something out of the top of my head - allow defining \ tags inside the namespace-specific tag. Like:   \\\   which will automatically replace the XHandlerAdapter defined by the BeanDefinitionParser with the custom one. I'm reporting the 'issue' in spring-core, because I think that for example AbstractBeanDefinitionParser, or the classes used to register the beans (ParserContext, etc), can be made aware of those inner beans, and use a bean with the same-class-or-subclass, if one is defined with \. I know that sounds vague, but the final idea is to allow customization of just one of the beans defined by the catch-all tag.  (And another thing is documentation. AnnotationDrivenBeanDefinitionParser does a good job showing what beans exactly it defines (except that its javadoc has not been updated from 3.0 to 3.1), but this is not true for many other parsers from portfolio projects. I know the core project can't enforce that, but just mentioning it)   --- No further details from [SPR-8784](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8784?redirect=false)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-10-17T12:34:29Z","2019-01-11T14:05:56Z"

The way to provide a custom exception handler (for the sake of logging the exception), you have to configure a TaskExecutor and supply it with a custom ThreadFactory, which in turn sets an uncaughtExceptionHandler to the created threads - not a very pleasant solution (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4531240/log-runtimeexception-thrown-from-thread-created-by-spring-via-the-async-annotati).  Since TaskScheduler implementations make use of TaskUtils.decorateWithErrorHandler(..) I think it is logical for TaskExecutor implementations to do the same, and use a LoggingErrorHandler by default.

So, if the annotation does not specify ""transactionManager"", a default transaction manager is supposed to be used (which is ""transactionManager""). However, when I step through the spring code, it appears that transactionManagerBeanName in TransactionAspectSupport is ""neo4jTransactionManager"". Then I realized there are actually two interceptors, and whichever gets created first seems to matter. That's why I reversed the  definitions (put the sql one on top), and everything worked.  I think this is undesirable behaviour. I don't know how exactly to fix it, because I'm not aware of the container behaviour with two interceptors, but it seems TransactionAspectSupport.determineTransactionManager(..) relies on the beanName per-interceptor (which appears to be incorrect in my case).  I don't know if having `@Transactional`.value() default ""transactionManager"" won't be better.

But then (when all sessions to the old version expire), I undeploy the older version, and its MBeanExporter deregisters its mbeans. However that turns out to deregister the ones deployed by the new version (they have the same name, of course).  Currently, I have two options: - use an incremented version in the key (mbean name), so that each new deployment has a different mbean name - extend the MBean exporter and add that option myself.  I picked the latter, but it would be nice to have this option built-in.

Thus provinding first class support for console based application context management and DI.  ## Features  1. Autowiring of main class dependencies 2. Auto-destruction of application context 3. Ability in the future to handle command line arguments as beans  ## Properties  1. Standardization 2. Consistency with other APIs 3. Minimal configuration 4. Intent revealing  ## Example  My visions is something like the following:  ``` import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.context.MainSupport; import org.springframework.context.ContextConfiguration; import org.springframework.context.support.AnnotationConfigContextLoader;  @ContextConfiguration(classes=AppConfig.class, loader=AnnotationConfigContextLoader.class) public class Main extends MainSupport {          @Autowired     private Service service;      public static void main( String[] args ) {         // MainSupport.execute         execute(args);     }          @Main     public void main() {         service.run();     }      } ```  The way this would work is as follows:  1. JVM calls `main` 2. `main` delegates to super class method `MainSupport.execute` provided by spring (analog of `SpringBeanAutowiringSupport`) 3. `MainSupport.execute` reads the `@ContextConfiguration` annotation and looks for a `@Main` annotation (analog of `@Test`) 4. `MainSupport.execute` creates the application context 5. `MainSupport.execute` create an application `Main` class instance 6. `MainSupport.execute` injects dependencies 7. `MainSupport.execute` wraps instance in a proxy that will advise the method annotated with `@Main`. This proxy will first call the annotated method and then destroy the application context  ---  **Issue Links:** - #12732 Provide Java main() for launching Spring applications  4 votes, 10 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-21T07:06:07Z","2019-01-11T22:24:56Z"

There is an outstanding feature request for officially supporting this version of HttpClient since the currently supported version (3.x) is no longer supported (see #11385). I created a port to the newer version of HttpClient (code included in referenced issue).  However, in 3.0.6 the HttpMessageConverters now set the content-length header on the message prior to using the httpclient to send the message. HttpClient 4.1 expects this header to NOT be set because it expects to be the one to set that header.  It would be nice to at least have the option for the converters to not set the content length. Ideally it would default to not setting them since that would be compatible with Spring 3.0.5. Otherwise I will have to rewrite all the message converters to upgrade to 3.0.6.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.6  **Issue Links:** - #13509 Truncated HTTP responses","closed","in: web,","spring-projects-issues","2011-09-12T08:03:09Z","2019-01-11T14:23:50Z"

However, that issue (a closed issue) describes it as only affecting 3.1 whereas I have found that it affects 3.0.5 as well. If you have a class with a property 'settings' that is defined as Map, you can reproduce the issue.  When a value of the map is a list the CollectionToObjectConverter is called and assigns the first value of my list to the collection which is not what I expected or want. For example,                                                                                           mylist                                                                   a                         b                                                                   (note - I tried use util:list as well and (as expected and should) received the same results).  Rather than reopen the closed issue, I decided I should create a new issue instead with the appropriate affected version. The resolution described in #13111 would be perfect if it could be backported to the 3.0.x line.  ---  **Affects:** 3.0.5  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/0df4631788da1c0055e7fb050d02013724ee9d42, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/a2f00f205a0b54c870a2f93684fa5fb30e0d2935","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-07-15T07:53:41Z","2019-01-11T13:19:19Z"

In order to support one form with several submit buttons:  ```html         ```  through a ""Multi Action"" controller, I think the following is the most elegant approach or design:  ```java @Controller public class RegistrationAction {     @RequestMapping(value = ""/registration/submit"", method = RequestMethod.POST, params = ""submitButton=Submit 1"")     public String submit() {       ...     }      @RequestMapping(value = ""/registration/submit"", method = RequestMethod.POST, params = ""submitButton=Submit 2"")     public String submit() {       ...     } } ```  The problem with this approach is that you need to hardcode the text label for the value attribute of the submit button, which is not nice in itself for refactoring, but also represents a huge drawback when you are dealing with a i18n/internationalized web applications, because you often have to customized the submit button text label, depending on the client locale.  So given the following **messages.properties** resource bundle:  ``` button.submit1=Submit 1 button.submit2=Submit 2 ```  I would have something like the following in my i18n compliant jsp:  ```html         ```  Then I was expecting the Spring MVC framework to accept something like this:  ```java @Controller public class RegistrationAction {     @RequestMapping(value = ""/registration/submit"", method = RequestMethod.POST, params = ""submitButton=button.submit1"")     public String submit() {       ...     }      @RequestMapping(value = ""/registration/submit"", method = RequestMethod.POST, params = ""submitButton=button.submit2"")     public String submit() {       ...     } } ```  The Struts Action class **LookupDispatchAction** resolves this in a very elegant way.   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  4 votes, 2 watchers","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-30T23:31:28Z","2011-11-23T06:09:17Z"

If no instance are available, I'd expect `charlies` to be `null` or an empty `Set` (preferably the latter). However, in reality, instantiation of `Alpha` will fail if no `Charlie` instances are available as the `Set` dependency cannot be satisfied.  Somewhat in desperation, we tried adding a second constructor to the class:  ``` @Autowired(required=false) public Alpha(Bravo bravo) {     ... } ```  Surprisingly, given that the javadoc for `@Autowired` states that ""only one constructor (at max) of any given bean class may carry this annotation"", this works. If there are no `Charlie` instances the single-argument constructor is called, and if there's one or more instances of `Charlie`, the two-argument constructor is called.  There's a couple of problems with this workaround. The first is that it's at odds with the documentation quoted above. The second is that it's not very extensible as, if you have multiple optional dependencies, you have to provide constructors for each permutation. For example:  ``` @Autowired(required=false) public Alpha(Bravo bravo) {     ... }  @Autowired(required=false) public Alpha(Bravo bravo, Set) {     ... }  @Autowired(required=false) public Alpha(Set deltas, Bravo bravo) {     ... }  @Autowired(required=false) public Alpha(Bravo bravo, Set charlies, Set deltas) {     ... } ```  If you only have the first and last constructor, Spring will always choose the first constructor that just takes `Bravo` unless there are one or more instances of both `Charlie` and `Delta` available for it to inject.  I'll submit a pull request with a project that reproduces the various permutations.   ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework-issues/commit/47e29c5379d537762f1d491eb255ab7d2f6973f0, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework-issues/commit/d2ca86436a478253b998879d56dfe93bed7294b8, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework-issues/commit/6c32b91d3fdbba0753429bf379154188c83e9cd4  7 votes, 6 watchers","closed","status: bulk-closed,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-23T06:46:53Z","2019-01-12T03:49:05Z"

The column type is set to NUMBER. An example of an ID is ""1000000009704976470"". Now, if we access by using `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.queryForLong (String sql, SqlParameterSource paramSource)` or overloaded methods, it returns the for example the long `1000000009704976512L` instead of `1000000009704976470L`. The cause lies in the implementation of the method `queryForLong`.  The current implementation looks like this: `public long queryForLong(String sql, SqlParameterSource paramSource) throws DataAccessException {` `Number number = queryForObject(sql, paramSource, *Number.class*);` `return (number != null ? number.longValue() : 0);` `}`  A solution could look like this: `public long queryForLong(String sql, SqlParameterSource paramSource) throws DataAccessException {` `Number number = queryForObject(sql, paramSource, *Long.class*);` `return (number != null ? number.longValue() : 0);` `}`  One note, the `JdbcTemplate` class implements the method `queryForLong` properly.   ---  **Affects:** 2.5.6, 3.0.5  **Issue Links:** - [DATAJDBC-15](https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAJDBC-15) Incorrect output of big numbers when using NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.queryForLong (_**""is duplicated by""**_)  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/77372d7cdb9cbb70ebc99ca86fc9eb949b4dba93, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/9b0412f35fd9cc3a14b1a737af98f5c3119cea41, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/118ee3fce89f305ea2fc938d539435218fa4e9cc","closed","type: bug,","spring-projects-issues","2011-08-30T07:38:01Z","2012-06-19T03:39:09Z"

Consider the following annotated methods that performs a redirect after a POST:  ```java @RequestMapping(value=""/test/"", method = RequestMethod.POST) public String testRedirect(HttpServletRequest request, RedirectAttributes redirectAttrs) {     redirectAttrs.addAttribute(""id1"", 10);     redirectAttrs.addAttribute(""id2"", 20);     redirectAttrs.addFlashAttribute(""message"", ""Hallo World"");     return ""redirect:/?id={id1}&id={id2}""; } ```  After the /test/ method is executed, the browser is redirected to the **/?id=10&id=20** URL.  When DefaultFlashMapManager tries to match the FlashMap object in the session with the URL, it always fails since it just supports one value for parameter.

But, after testing and debugging, I found out that this won't work, since the import directive treats spring.ftl as a relative path (in current Freemarker version 2.3.18), so for example, if I'm adding the import to an ftl that's under {templates_root}/pages/index.ftl, the final template name will be resolved to /pages/spring.ftl, and the ClassPathTemplateLoader won't find it.

This might be ambiguous, cause ""resolve"" method returns the ""closeMatch"" method which calculation depends on the order in which the methods are defined. This is fragile in case the class is being re-structured.  - Does not support 1.5 generics during method parameter matching (using GenericTypeResolver.resolveParameterType and TypeUtils). This breaks Java 5 compiler rules. See example:    public class ReflectionUtil\ {        public Object methodToCall(T param) {             return ""Object methodToCall(T param)"";       }              public static void main(String[] args) {             // Java compiler does NOT allow passing Long!             new ReflectionUtil< Integer >().methodToCall( (Long) Long.MAX_VALUE );                    // ReflectiveMethodResolver DOES allow.

Providing a hard-coded list of profiles declared via the `value` or `profiles` attribute of `@ActiveProfiles`   - since Spring Framework 3.1 2. Specifying a custom `ActiveProfilesResolver` (which programmatically determines the active profiles) declared via the `resolver` attribute of `@ActiveProfiles`   - since Spring Framework 4.0  In stand-alone or production code, Spring honors the `spring.profiles.active` system property for determining the set of active profiles to use when loading an `ApplicationContext`; however, the TCF _ignores_ this system property, relying solely on configuration via `@ActiveProfiles`.  ---  #### Proposals  1. Provide the ability to override `@ActiveProfiles` specified in an integration test via the `spring.profiles.active` system property or some other system property specific to the TCF. 2. Set the `spring.profiles.active` system property to the value specified via `@ActiveProfiles`    - See comments in this issue for background.    - This point likely warrants its own JIRA issue for proper consideration.  ---  #### Implementation Notes  - Consider introducing a new `boolean` flag in `@ActiveProfiles` that allows profiles declared via the annotation to be overridden by those defined via the `spring.profiles.active` system property (if it is present).  ---  #### Further Resources  Related discussions at Stack Overflow:  - [Spring integration tests with profile](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20571356/388980) - [Defining a spring active profile within a test use case](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23213869/defining-a-spring-active-profile-within-a-test-use-case) - [@ActiveProfiles value is not being assigned to config](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22053683/activeprofiles-value-is-not-being-assigned-to-config)  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 GA  **Issue Links:** - #12410 Decide what to do with `@IfProfileValue` - #9538 Introduce strategy for determining if a profile value is enabled for a particular test environment - #13625 SystemProfileValueSource is not very compatible with the new 3.1 default system property profiles - #16300 Introduce annotation to skip test based on active Spring profile - #15761 spring.profiles.active is not honored when building the context cache key in the TestContext framework  19 votes, 24 watchers","open","has: votes-jira,","spring-projects-issues","2012-01-03T01:08:02Z","2022-03-16T15:23:51Z"

This is because `SessionFactoryUtils.getDataSource(getSessionFactory())` returns `null` because the `getSessionFactory()` method returns a Proxy rather than an instance of `SessionFactoryImpl`.  ---  **Affects:** 3.1 M2  **Reference URL:** http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?110780-Configuration-of-Spring-Hibernate-and-Hibernate-Search-using-Configuration-3.1.0.M2  **Attachments:** - [mylyn-context.zip](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18438/mylyn-context.zip) (_47.40 kB_)  **Issue Links:** - #13138 Transaction problem with AnnotationSessionFactoryBuilder and `@EnableTransactionManagement`  **Referenced from:** commits https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/b82d5ae8da7a62a5b2187b6595ffe2111d2bd212, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/5aa24af1269bf0ac9691afc63da6f6051543ad6a","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2011-06-20T07:37:37Z","2019-01-13T07:08:44Z"

This messes up the ApplicationContext. There is never a case that component-scan should be looking inside classes annotated with ContextConfiguration. How these classes configure themselves is none of component-scan's business.  Granted, this generally occurs with test code and most people separate their test code from their source code, but there is no requirement that this MUST be so. For me, at least, it isn't. Anyway, shouldn't be a difficult fix to make this right.

So for JSF components I picked up PrimeFaces. Now in some input components of PrimeFaces (like ) the input field in HTML gets named as ""componentId_input"" and are Posted back as such. But in our ModelAttribute we have fields as ""componentId"". But because the post back parameters have ""componentId_input"" but not ""componentId"" so binding did not happen which for all practical purposes meant that certain PrimeFaces component values were not being binded to ModelAttribute by spring.  So to overcome this problem I have coded a PrimeFacesInterceptor class. What this class does is that it wraps the original request and adds more parameters to wrapped request with name=""componentId"" if ""componentId_input"" was present in original request. So in context xml file one can do something like:  [code] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [/code]  This will register PrimeFaces interceptor with handler mapping bean and will pre-handle the requests appropriately.  I will be delighted to see an improvement to my solution.   ---  **Affects:** 3.0.6  **Attachments:** - [PrimeFacesInterceptor.java](https://jira.spring.io/secure/attachment/18867/PrimeFacesInterceptor.java) (_4.63 kB_)","closed","type: enhancement,","spring-projects-issues","2011-10-05T07:28:40Z","2012-09-10T16:00:37Z"

I the docs should explain this issue to avoid frustrating users I came very close to giving up on LTW even though I had managed to get it working many times with tomcat 6.0 Here is the recommend text you can add to the user manual in some sort of visible side note in that section.  Tomcat 7.x requires an extra step to make it work with LTW. You must use a web.xml that is configured for servlets 2.5 or set metadata-complete=""true"" attribute on the web-app element. The problem arises because tomcat scans the web application class path looking for classes containing selvets, listeners, and other features of Servlets 3.0 and while scanning it loads the classes before spring has had a chance to initialize itself and configure LTW.    ---  **Affects:** 3.0.7, 3.1 GA","closed","in: core,","spring-projects-issues","2012-02-10T10:42:05Z","2019-01-12T05:29:13Z"

It would be great if in the meantime at least a few of you could take the new build for a spin.  Even if you don't get a chance to try it before Monday, merging into master will be low-impact, as everyone is focused on 3.1.x work right now anyway (3.1.x will remain permanently on spring-build).  Just follow the instructions at https://github.com/cbeams/spring-framework#building_from_source, but instead of cloning a new repository as the documentation suggests, you can simply add me as a remote to your existing spring-framework repository and check out the 'gradle' branch there:  ``` $ git remote add cbeams git@github.com:cbeams/spring-framework.git $ git fetch cbeams $ git checkout -b gradle cbeams/gradle $ ./gradlew build ``` ## Documentation  I would also appreciate feedback on these new wiki docs: - [Gradle build and release FAQ](https://github.com/cbeams/spring-framework/wiki/Gradle-build-and-release-FAQ) - [SpringSource repository FAQ](https://github.com/cbeams/spring-framework/wiki/SpringSource-repository-FAQ)  Note that a lot of the information there is general and not specific only to Spring Framework, but I wanted to get all this down in one place for now.  We can think about hosting it somewhere more general later.  While these are written for a mixed audience of committers and end-users, I want to make sure that this is documentation that any project lead can look at to understand how things work, particularly with regard to release management.
