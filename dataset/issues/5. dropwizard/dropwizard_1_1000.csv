"","5265","Cannot inject a custom principal into unauthenticated request","When a method in a Jersey resource has a parameter (for instance of some type `User`) annotated with `@Auth` and authentication fails, the following exception is thrown:  ``` ERROR [2022-05-02 08:34:03,534] io.dropwizard.jersey.errors.IllegalStateExceptionMapper: Error handling a request: 1fa109dc501e3397 ! java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot inject a custom principal into unauthenticated request ! at io.dropwizard.auth.PrincipalContainerRequestValueFactory.provide(PrincipalContainerRequestValueFactory.java:25) ! at io.dropwizard.auth.AuthValueFactoryProvider.lambda$createValueProvider$1(AuthValueFactoryProvider.java:51) ! at org.glassfish.jersey.server.spi.internal.ParamValueFactoryWithSource.apply(ParamValueFactoryWithSource.java:50) ```  While I can clearly see where this is coming from, I am not sure that it is always practical. It seems that Dropwizard requires authentication prior to injecting a principal, which is somewhat reasonable for many scenarios. For a particular application, I need a resource that also accepts anonymous (e.g. `null`) users to serve public content (whereas authenticated and authorized users see the public content plus X with X being the protected content).  As a workaround, I could append an AnonymousAuthenticator at the end of an Auth Chain and let this one create the `User` object. If Chained authentication is not necessary, a separate code path in a dedicated authenticator might also do the job (but is a dead end as soon as the application requires an additional authentication mechanism.)  So in general I can mitigate my particular problem in some ways but none of them feels 100% right. Is there a good reason why Dropwizard does not simply inject a NULL Principal if authentication cannot be performed?","closed","","matthias-mueller","2022-05-03T20:06:10Z","2022-05-05T10:04:27Z"

In the latter excerpt however, the `pool-3-thread-1` seems to be slow or even blocked and no log entry is written, until the shutdown wait period is over.  I'm just wondering, what to do about this. Since I've never seen CircleCI or GitHub Actions builds failing, I see no issue with the test here. And as the builds only fail sometimes on Appveyor, I also wouldn't assume a Windows issue. The only option I currently see, is to disable the Appveyor run (with disabling the test on Windows). Are there any other opinions I'm missing?","closed","improvement,","zUniQueX","2022-01-17T20:30:06Z","2022-01-21T10:32:54Z"

This PR uses the `GrizzlyConnectorProvider` because it passes most of our tests.  ###### Breaking change: This PR technically is a breaking change, since the obtained client builder is configured differently. But as the HTTP PATCH method will not work on Java 16+, this is a tradeoff IMO.

This is because the overall app state is calculated by `HealthCheckManager` only when there is a state change from a health check: https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/dd25ab7b61052721af2ebec54a6b8da5ced30edd/dropwizard-health/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/health/HealthCheckManager.java#L161 https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/dd25ab7b61052721af2ebec54a6b8da5ced30edd/dropwizard-health/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/health/HealthCheckManager.java#L197  And if there aren't any checks, then no state change triggers and the state is never recalculated (even though the counter of failed checks is actually zero).  I guess that Dropwizard must do an explicit test and in case there aren't any checks registered, consider that the condition is satisfied (technically it is) and instantly set the respective flag (`isAppAlive` or `isAppHealthy`) to `true`.","open","","oneadr-3773","2022-05-04T13:58:49Z","2022-05-06T06:04:12Z"

"","4805","Automatic reload of certificates","I've seen SslReloadBundle, but that seems like it places the burden of noticing that certificates have changed on some external daemon, when it might as well be handled internally.  In my use case, as I suspect many others, certificates are rotated by an external daemon such as cert-manager that simply replaces the certificates when they are about to expire and that daemon doesn't particularly have a need to know about the consumer of the certificate.  The true Kubernetes way to consume certificates would be to use the API server to watch the certificate resource and reload it when it changes, but that comes with a somewhat heavy burden of having to depend on the k8s api, when that might not otherwise be needed.  I think the simplest solution is to simply mount the TLS secret in the filesystem and load the certificates from the file system and then periodically poll the files for changes.  For my own dropwizard-kubernetes-https module I've implemented a very simple automatic ssl reloader that does not need an external daemon to poke the server to reload the certificates and I wonder if something like this is a candidate for core?  https://gitlab.com/dren.dk/dropwizard-kubernetes-https/-/tree/main/src/main/java/dk/dren/dw/k8s/https/reloader","closed","","dren-dk","2022-02-22T07:20:34Z","2022-02-26T10:34:16Z"

"","5027","File Appender writes on Mac but not windows","I have a (complex) configuration where I'm using my FIleAppenderFactory to extend RollingFileAppender so that I can parse out which messages to append. (Arguably I could do this with file filters and additive appenders, but we've got a complex enough situation where we were 90% of the way there, that it felt easier to do this, and we also do some mods of the filenames and other things, so we had a file appender factory already).  Things start up without complaint, the log files are created, I see logs coming in and I pass them to the super.doAppend in the RollingFileAppender, and it works on Mac (both from IntelliJ command line and when run via Jar). But if I take that same jar and run it on windows, the system works normally, all the expected logs are created .... but nothing ever gets written). I can see (via sysouts) the same settings getting created in my rolling file appender, and the same ""I got this log, should I write it"" messages my class puts out, and the calls to super.doAppend() ... but nothing?  Before I had the same issue on Mac and Windows, but that may have been because I was using a delegation model and with some methods.  Note -- I do not call the super.buildAppender() in my factory (but I just cut and pasted the relevant code) because when I called the supper.buildAppender, the logs did not write on Windows or Mac.   Are there known issues that might be causing this? If not I will submit more information for a full bug report.","closed","","BrianAtAustin","2022-03-24T15:35:56Z","2022-03-24T20:11:33Z"

But the annotations from JSR305 can be replaced with annotations from other packages. NullAway states in the [configuration docs](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Configuration#custom-nullability-annotations), that any annotations with the names `@Nullable`, `@Nonnull`, `@NonNull` and `@NotNull` are considered and not only those from JSR305. Therefore the annotations from `org.jetbrains.annotations` should be fine. (I've used Jetbrains' annotations here, since the package is much smaller than `checker-qual` or similar packages.)  The annotations of the package `javax.annotation.concurrent` can be replaced by annotations from errorprone. The [errorprone docs](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/Immutable) additionally state, that the JSR305 `@Immutable` annotation is not evaluated, but the errorprone one is. So we should have an additional advantage there.  The one `@NotThreadSafe` annotation is replaced with jUnit's `@Execution(SAME_THREAD)`, as it was done in #5149.","closed","","zUniQueX","2022-04-15T14:29:48Z","2022-04-18T12:13:41Z"

Now, using HiveMQ as part of your integration tests is as simple as a couple of lines of Java code:  ```java  @​Container HiveMQContainer hivemq = new HiveMQContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""hivemq/hivemq-ce:2021.3"")); hivemq.start();  Mqtt5BlockingClient client = Mqtt5Client.builder()     .serverPort(hivemqCe.getMqttPort())     .serverHost(hivemqCe.getHost())     .buildBlocking();  client.connect(); ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/hivemq/) to learn more about its many features!  ##### 💀 Ryuk JVM mode ([#​4959](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4959)) ([#​4960](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4960)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup)  Many Testcontainers user love the convenience Ryuk brings to Testcontainers: No matter what you do in your integration tests, Ryuk has got you covered and will cleanup all Docker resources created by Testcontainers after your test run is finished.  But some users operate Testcontainers in environments which do not support our container-based Ryuk implementation. So far their only option was to [disable Ryuk](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#disabling-ryuk) alltogether.  Coming with this release, Testcontainers will now fallback to a JVM based resource-cleanup implementation in case of Ryuk being disabled. While this won't be as robust as the Ryuk container based implementation in all circumstances, it is nevertheless a great addition and acts as a useful compromise.  #### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   Allow to create a container file from a Transferable ([#​3814](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3814)) ([#​3815](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3815)) [@​thomasdarimont](https://togithub.com/thomasdarimont) -   Elasticsearch: Ensure Elasticsearch 8 works OOTB secure as default ([#​5099](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5099)) [@​spinscale](https://togithub.com/spinscale) -   Deperecate `getContainerIpAddress` ([#​5247](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5247)) [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview) -   Fix ScriptUtils.runInitScript() in hierarchical classloader setup by using TCCL ([#​5167](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5167)) [@​famod](https://togithub.com/famod) -   \[HiveMQ] added tmpFs ([#​5109](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5109)) [@​YannickWeber](https://togithub.com/YannickWeber) -   Replace deprecated `checkAndPullImage` with `RemoteDockerImage` ([#​5148](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5148)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup) -   Enable Neo4j labs plugin definition.

Now, using HiveMQ as part of your integration tests is as simple as a couple of lines of Java code:  ```java  @​Container HiveMQContainer hivemq = new HiveMQContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""hivemq/hivemq-ce:2021.3"")); hivemq.start();  Mqtt5BlockingClient client = Mqtt5Client.builder()     .serverPort(hivemqCe.getMqttPort())     .serverHost(hivemqCe.getHost())     .buildBlocking();  client.connect(); ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/hivemq/) to learn more about its many features!  ##### 💀 Ryuk JVM mode ([#​4959](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4959)) ([#​4960](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4960)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup)  Many Testcontainers user love the convenience Ryuk brings to Testcontainers: No matter what you do in your integration tests, Ryuk has got you covered and will cleanup all Docker resources created by Testcontainers after your test run is finished.  But some users operate Testcontainers in environments which do not support our container-based Ryuk implementation. So far their only option was to [disable Ryuk](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#disabling-ryuk) alltogether.  Coming with this release, Testcontainers will now fallback to a JVM based resource-cleanup implementation in case of Ryuk being disabled. While this won't be as robust as the Ryuk container based implementation in all circumstances, it is nevertheless a great addition and acts as a useful compromise.  #### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   Allow to create a container file from a Transferable ([#​3814](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3814)) ([#​3815](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3815)) [@​thomasdarimont](https://togithub.com/thomasdarimont) -   Elasticsearch: Ensure Elasticsearch 8 works OOTB secure as default ([#​5099](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5099)) [@​spinscale](https://togithub.com/spinscale) -   Deperecate `getContainerIpAddress` ([#​5247](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5247)) [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview) -   Fix ScriptUtils.runInitScript() in hierarchical classloader setup by using TCCL ([#​5167](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5167)) [@​famod](https://togithub.com/famod) -   \[HiveMQ] added tmpFs ([#​5109](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5109)) [@​YannickWeber](https://togithub.com/YannickWeber) -   Replace deprecated `checkAndPullImage` with `RemoteDockerImage` ([#​5148](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5148)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup) -   Enable Neo4j labs plugin definition.

Now, using HiveMQ as part of your integration tests is as simple as a couple of lines of Java code:  ```java  @​Container HiveMQContainer hivemq = new HiveMQContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""hivemq/hivemq-ce:2021.3"")); hivemq.start();  Mqtt5BlockingClient client = Mqtt5Client.builder()     .serverPort(hivemqCe.getMqttPort())     .serverHost(hivemqCe.getHost())     .buildBlocking();  client.connect(); ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/hivemq/) to learn more about its many features!  ##### 💀 Ryuk JVM mode ([#​4959](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4959)) ([#​4960](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4960)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup)  Many Testcontainers user love the convenience Ryuk brings to Testcontainers: No matter what you do in your integration tests, Ryuk has got you covered and will cleanup all Docker resources created by Testcontainers after your test run is finished.  But some users operate Testcontainers in environments which do not support our container-based Ryuk implementation. So far their only option was to [disable Ryuk](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#disabling-ryuk) alltogether.  Coming with this release, Testcontainers will now fallback to a JVM based resource-cleanup implementation in case of Ryuk being disabled. While this won't be as robust as the Ryuk container based implementation in all circumstances, it is nevertheless a great addition and acts as a useful compromise.  #### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   Allow to create a container file from a Transferable ([#​3814](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3814)) ([#​3815](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3815)) [@​thomasdarimont](https://togithub.com/thomasdarimont) -   Elasticsearch: Ensure Elasticsearch 8 works OOTB secure as default ([#​5099](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5099)) [@​spinscale](https://togithub.com/spinscale) -   Deperecate `getContainerIpAddress` ([#​5247](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5247)) [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview) -   Fix ScriptUtils.runInitScript() in hierarchical classloader setup by using TCCL ([#​5167](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5167)) [@​famod](https://togithub.com/famod) -   \[HiveMQ] added tmpFs ([#​5109](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5109)) [@​YannickWeber](https://togithub.com/YannickWeber) -   Replace deprecated `checkAndPullImage` with `RemoteDockerImage` ([#​5148](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5148)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup) -   Enable Neo4j labs plugin definition.

Now, using HiveMQ as part of your integration tests is as simple as a couple of lines of Java code:  ```java  @​Container HiveMQContainer hivemq = new HiveMQContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""hivemq/hivemq-ce:2021.3"")); hivemq.start();  Mqtt5BlockingClient client = Mqtt5Client.builder()     .serverPort(hivemqCe.getMqttPort())     .serverHost(hivemqCe.getHost())     .buildBlocking();  client.connect(); ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/hivemq/) to learn more about its many features!  ##### 💀 Ryuk JVM mode ([#​4959](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4959)) ([#​4960](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4960)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup)  Many Testcontainers user love the convenience Ryuk brings to Testcontainers: No matter what you do in your integration tests, Ryuk has got you covered and will cleanup all Docker resources created by Testcontainers after your test run is finished.  But some users operate Testcontainers in environments which do not support our container-based Ryuk implementation. So far their only option was to [disable Ryuk](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#disabling-ryuk) alltogether.  Coming with this release, Testcontainers will now fallback to a JVM based resource-cleanup implementation in case of Ryuk being disabled. While this won't be as robust as the Ryuk container based implementation in all circumstances, it is nevertheless a great addition and acts as a useful compromise.  #### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   Allow to create a container file from a Transferable ([#​3814](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3814)) ([#​3815](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/3815)) [@​thomasdarimont](https://togithub.com/thomasdarimont) -   Elasticsearch: Ensure Elasticsearch 8 works OOTB secure as default ([#​5099](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5099)) [@​spinscale](https://togithub.com/spinscale) -   Deperecate `getContainerIpAddress` ([#​5247](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5247)) [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview) -   Fix ScriptUtils.runInitScript() in hierarchical classloader setup by using TCCL ([#​5167](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5167)) [@​famod](https://togithub.com/famod) -   \[HiveMQ] added tmpFs ([#​5109](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5109)) [@​YannickWeber](https://togithub.com/YannickWeber) -   Replace deprecated `checkAndPullImage` with `RemoteDockerImage` ([#​5148](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/5148)) [@​bsideup](https://togithub.com/bsideup) -   Enable Neo4j labs plugin definition.

In particular, this is useful for people developing Kubernetes controllers/operators, who need something more than just a mocked Kubernetes API. In this release we're bringing the k3s module, which gives you a neat way to spin up the [K3S lightweight Kubernetes](https://k3s.io/) inside of a container. We believe that k3s hits a sweet spot for ease of use and performance, so is a good option for testing Kubernetes components.  Now, launching a lightweight single-node Kubernetes cluster within your tests is easy as:  ```java K3sContainer k3s = new K3sContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""rancher/k3s:v1.21.3-k3s1"")); k3s.start();  String kubeConfigYaml = k3s.getKubeConfigYaml(); ApiClient client = Config.fromConfig(new StringReader(kubeConfigYaml));  // now use `client` to talk to your cluster! ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/k3s/) to find out more!  ##### Selenium 4 compatibility ([#​4914](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4914)) [@​GannaChernyshova](https://togithub.com/GannaChernyshova), [@​tobiasstadler](https://togithub.com/tobiasstadler), [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview), [@​rnorth](https://togithub.com/rnorth)  Selenium 4 was [announced a while back](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/announcing-selenium-4/), but we needed to make some changes to Testcontainers' Selenium/Webdriver module for compatibility. We're happy to announce that these changes have now been made, so you can now use Selenium 4 with Testcontainers!  As part of this upgrade we have to drop compatibility with Selenium 2, but believe that this will not have any practical impact.  ##### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   \[Reusable mode] Don't log about starting container unnecessarily ([#​4844](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4844)) [@​pkubowicz](https://togithub.com/pkubowicz) -   Display Ryuk logs when it fails to start ([#​4842](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4842)) [@​vincz7777](https://togithub.com/vincz7777) -   \[couchbase] Explicitly configure service quotas (and allow customizat… ([#​4802](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4802)) [@​daschl](https://togithub.com/daschl) -   removed hardcoded log level setting on mockserver ([#​4798](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4798)) [@​szymonprz](https://togithub.com/szymonprz) -   \[couchbase] Ignore transient primary index creation error.

In particular, this is useful for people developing Kubernetes controllers/operators, who need something more than just a mocked Kubernetes API. In this release we're bringing the k3s module, which gives you a neat way to spin up the [K3S lightweight Kubernetes](https://k3s.io/) inside of a container. We believe that k3s hits a sweet spot for ease of use and performance, so is a good option for testing Kubernetes components.  Now, launching a lightweight single-node Kubernetes cluster within your tests is easy as:  ```java K3sContainer k3s = new K3sContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""rancher/k3s:v1.21.3-k3s1"")); k3s.start();  String kubeConfigYaml = k3s.getKubeConfigYaml(); ApiClient client = Config.fromConfig(new StringReader(kubeConfigYaml));  // now use `client` to talk to your cluster! ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/k3s/) to find out more!  ##### Selenium 4 compatibility ([#​4914](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4914)) [@​GannaChernyshova](https://togithub.com/GannaChernyshova), [@​tobiasstadler](https://togithub.com/tobiasstadler), [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview), [@​rnorth](https://togithub.com/rnorth)  Selenium 4 was [announced a while back](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/announcing-selenium-4/), but we needed to make some changes to Testcontainers' Selenium/Webdriver module for compatibility. We're happy to announce that these changes have now been made, so you can now use Selenium 4 with Testcontainers!  As part of this upgrade we have to drop compatibility with Selenium 2, but believe that this will not have any practical impact.  #### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   \[Reusable mode] Don't log about starting container unnecessarily ([#​4844](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4844)) [@​pkubowicz](https://togithub.com/pkubowicz) -   Display Ryuk logs when it fails to start ([#​4842](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4842)) [@​vincz7777](https://togithub.com/vincz7777) -   \[couchbase] Explicitly configure service quotas (and allow customizat… ([#​4802](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4802)) [@​daschl](https://togithub.com/daschl) -   removed hardcoded log level setting on mockserver ([#​4798](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4798)) [@​szymonprz](https://togithub.com/szymonprz) -   \[couchbase] Ignore transient primary index creation error.

In particular, this is useful for people developing Kubernetes controllers/operators, who need something more than just a mocked Kubernetes API. In this release we're bringing the k3s module, which gives you a neat way to spin up the [K3S lightweight Kubernetes](https://k3s.io/) inside of a container. We believe that k3s hits a sweet spot for ease of use and performance, so is a good option for testing Kubernetes components.  Now, launching a lightweight single-node Kubernetes cluster within your tests is easy as:  ```java K3sContainer k3s = new K3sContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""rancher/k3s:v1.21.3-k3s1"")); k3s.start();  String kubeConfigYaml = k3s.getKubeConfigYaml(); ApiClient client = Config.fromConfig(new StringReader(kubeConfigYaml));  // now use `client` to talk to your cluster! ```  Check out [the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/k3s/) to find out more!  ##### Selenium 4 compatibility ([#​4914](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4914)) [@​GannaChernyshova](https://togithub.com/GannaChernyshova), [@​tobiasstadler](https://togithub.com/tobiasstadler), [@​kiview](https://togithub.com/kiview), [@​rnorth](https://togithub.com/rnorth)  Selenium 4 was [announced a while back](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/announcing-selenium-4/), but we needed to make some changes to Testcontainers' Selenium/Webdriver module for compatibility. We're happy to announce that these changes have now been made, so you can now use Selenium 4 with Testcontainers!  As part of this upgrade we have to drop compatibility with Selenium 2, but believe that this will not have any practical impact.  #### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -   \[Reusable mode] Don't log about starting container unnecessarily ([#​4844](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4844)) [@​pkubowicz](https://togithub.com/pkubowicz) -   Display Ryuk logs when it fails to start ([#​4842](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4842)) [@​vincz7777](https://togithub.com/vincz7777) -   \[couchbase] Explicitly configure service quotas (and allow customizat… ([#​4802](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4802)) [@​daschl](https://togithub.com/daschl) -   removed hardcoded log level setting on mockserver ([#​4798](https://togithub.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/4798)) [@​szymonprz](https://togithub.com/szymonprz) -   \[couchbase] Ignore transient primary index creation error.

The `lib` directory is still included in the classpath as the place users can add whatever additional global drivers/libraries they need.  The `liquibase --version` output has been enhanced to also include the 3rd party libraries being used and their versions.  Impacts:  -   If you are upgrading Liquibase by overwriting an existing directory, you will have duplicate libraries between `lib` and `internal/lib`. You should manually delete any files in `lib` which you did not add yourself. Liquibase will continue to work even with the duplicate libraries, but you may not be running the latest version of ones we ship, since the `lib` files take priority over what is in `internal/lib`. New installs are not impacted by this. -   If you have any automation that did anything with our shipped files in `lib` you will need to update it to reflect the new `internal/lib` location  For security reasons, we have also changed what is logged by the CLI to only log `liquibase` channel messages by default, rather than all log channels. If you are relying on logging from non-Liquibase libraries, you can add channels with the new `--log-channels` flag, including `--log-channels=all` to restore the old functionality.  ##### Enhancements  -   Moved shipped jar files out of `lib` and into a new `internal/lib` directory by [@​nvoxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland) in [https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2850](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2850) -   To help with performance troubleshooting, there is now a `--monitor-performance` argument for the CLI (and only the CLI) which enables profiling of the Liquibase run. The generated profiling information can help us understand and fix performance issues easier.

The `lib` directory is still included in the classpath as the place users can add whatever additional global drivers/libraries they need.  The `liquibase --version` output has been enhanced to also include the 3rd party libraries being used and their versions.  Impacts:  -   If you are upgrading Liquibase by overwriting an existing directory, you will have duplicate libraries between `lib` and `internal/lib`. You should manually delete any files in `lib` which you did not add yourself. Liquibase will continue to work even with the duplicate libraries, but you may not be running the latest version of ones we ship, since the `lib` files take priority over what is in `internal/lib`. New installs are not impacted by this. -   If you have any automation that did anything with our shipped files in `lib` you will need to update it to reflect the new `internal/lib` location  For security reasons, we have also changed what is logged by the CLI to only log `liquibase` channel messages by default, rather than all log channels. If you are relying on logging from non-Liquibase libraries, you can add channels with the new `--log-channels` flag, including `--log-channels=all` to restore the old functionality.  ##### Enhancements  -   Moved shipped jar files out of `lib` and into a new `internal/lib` directory by [@​nvoxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland) in [https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2850](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2850) -   To help with performance troubleshooting, there is now a `--monitor-performance` argument for the CLI (and only the CLI) which enables profiling of the Liquibase run.

For example, you do not want to have a dash in the table, column, and sequence names. With the multiple objects check, you can specify a pattern to check for dashes and choose tables, columns, and sequences as the objects to check. In version 4.6.2, the check is available for:  -   Table -   Column -   Sequence  **Note:** For more information, see  [Multiple Objects Quality Check](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/community/quality-checks/multiple-objects.html)  \[DAT-8444]  ##### The logging of SQL statements and execution output  Liquibase  4.6.2 includes the  `liquibase.sql.logLevel`  configuration option to control the level at which SQL is logged. The default value is  `FINE`.  You can run the  `--sql-log-level`  parameter with the  `--log-level `  parameter in the CLI:  ```text liquibase --sql-log-level  --log-level= --log-file=log.txt update --changelog-file= ```  You can also set the parameter as follows:  -   `liquibase.sql.logLevel: `  in your  `liquibase.properties`  file -   `LIQUIBASE_SQL_LOG_LEVEL=`  as an environment variable \[[PR#​1520](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1520)] \[[nvoxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland)]  ##### An additional  `liquibase_libs`  directory  When you run Liquibase in the CLI, the executables generate a classpath with the  `.jar`  files from the  `LIQUIBASE_HOME`  and  `LIQUIBASE_HOME/lib`  directories. Liquibase 4.6.2 adds the ability to load an additional directory of  `liquibase_libs`  in the current working directory to the classpath.

Use version     2.x if you are using Liquibase versions lower than 4.0.0. -   Upgraded to SLF4J 1.7.30. -   Added the ability to change the priority number of the logger by setting a Java property. To change the priority, set     the `com.mattbertolini.liquibase.logging.slf4j.Slf4jLogService.priority` property to an integer value. -   Repackaged logger now that package name is no longer used for locating third-party loggers. -   Java 8 is now the minimum supported JDK version. -   Added an `Automatic-Module-Name` to support the Java 9+ module system. The module name is `com.mattbertolini.liquibase.logging.slf4j`. -   Overhauled build files.    ---  ### Configuration  📅 **Schedule**: ""before 2am"" (UTC).  🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

"","5243","Setting logging appender target as lowercase ""stdout"" or ""stderr"" failure","- Dropwizard version 2.1x  - Issue description:     In the [Dropwizard Console Logging Doc](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/manual/core.html#console-logging) as well as javadoc of the `ConsoleAppenderFactory Class`, both indicate that the `target` property can be a lowercase word `stderr` or `stdout`. However, this setting failure is exposed when we are using customized JSON Deserialization in the application as following:    ```java         bootstrap.getObjectMapper()         .enable(DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE);    ```    and addressed out the logging appender's target setting in `test-example.yml` and `example.yml`:     ```yaml    appenders:        - type: console          # add target for test          target: stdout   ```     Exception is thrown as following:    ```bash    [ERROR] com.example.helloworld.IntegrationTest  Time elapsed: 0.456 s  <<< ERROR!    io.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationParsingException:     test-example.yml has an error:      * Incorrect type of value at: logging.appenders.[0].target; is of type: String, expected: ConsoleStream     Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException:     Cannot deserialize value of type `io.dropwizard.logging.ConsoleAppenderFactory$ConsoleStream` from String ""stdout"": not     one of the values accepted for Enum class: [STDERR, STDOUT]  at [Source: UNKNOWN; line: -1, column: -1] (through reference     chain: com.example.helloworld.HelloWorldConfiguration[""logging""]-     >io.dropwizard.logging.DefaultLoggingFactory[""appenders""]->java.util.ArrayList[0]-     >io.dropwizard.logging.ConsoleAppenderFactory[""target""])     ``` - Issue can be reproduced by `git clone` this [dropwizard-example forked branch](https://github.com/yingliu928/dropwizard/tree/test-target).    run`mvn clean install` after `git clone`, the above exception will be thrown.   Also,  [this PR](https://github.com/yingliu928/dropwizard/pull/1) shows the modifications from the original `dropwizard-example` repo to expose this issue.  The exception won't be thrown when ommitting out the `target` property in `test-example.yml`  or using the default JSON Deserialization settings. In this case, I assume the default setting ""STDOUT"" is being used.  This exception won't be thrown when passing an uppercase word `STDOUT` or `STDERR` as the value to the target. So it indicates that the `enum ConsoleStream` Class won't accept lowercase words for the `target` property, which contradicts the [Dropwizard Console Logging Doc](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/manual/core.html#console-logging) as well as the javadoc for the `ConsoleAppenderFactory` Class.","open","bug,","yingliu928","2022-04-26T20:32:55Z","2022-04-28T21:55:03Z"

Liquibase suggests adding the path `'/'` as a fix when migrating to 4.x.x. This seems to work on Linux, but not on Windows. So this PR adds the operating system specific root path (`C:\` for Windows and `/` otherwise). Additionally, the location of the code source is added (acquired through the `CloseableLiquibase` class).  This allows finding files with an absolute path and files located under `src/main/resources`, that are packaged into the jar as resources. Previously, it was possible to provide paths relative to the root folder of the project, which now isn't possible any more. However, the sources are unlikely to be deployed, so this should be enough in my opinion, when adding this behavior change to the migration guide. This also includes changes to be made to `.xml` files including other ones, as the include mechanism uses the same resolving strategy.  ###### Result: Users can specify custom files to the `dropwizard-migrations` module instead of using the default `migrations.xml`.

Back in those good old times, it was impossible to create `ExceptionMapper`s to handle persistence exceptions thrown during the `afterEnd` phase of the unit of work. The fix in PR #958 wraps the exception with Jersey's `MappableException` before rethrowing.  We have a custom `HibernateBundle` that provides multi-tenancy and must support the case where tenant database instances are offline. We'd like to handle the errors caused by an offline tenant using `ExceptionMapper`s as well, but that's impossible because exceptions thrown during the `beforeStart` phase are not wrapped in `MappableException`.  ### Steps to reproduce  Using the provided [minimal test case](https://gist.github.com/andref/9869a3c483b57eb8bf1f145740fe5c71), first turn off the database server (using httpie here, `curl -X` at will):      http POST localhost:3000/db/stop  Request the resource method that has a unit of work:      http GET localhost:3000/db  This normally returns ""hello, world"", but if the database is turned off, an exception will be thrown during the `beforeStart` phase. The app has an exception mapper that can handle the situation (see stack trace) and respond with a nice HTTP 503, but it is never invoked and we get an ugly 500 instead:  ```http HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error Cache-Control: must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store Connection: close Content-Length: 382 Content-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-1     Error 500 Request failed.
