"","4155","Adds more robust health checking / scheduling functionality to base D…","…ropwizard framework  https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/4154  This is a first pass at integrating the dropwizard-health functionality into the Dropwizard framework, and adapting the Bundle-based approach into a top-level `Configuration` factory (that is completely optional).  I'm expecting there to be some back and forth on this, and probably a bunch of things I may have missed. That, and I know I'm currently missing more detailed documentation around this change, but I'd like to start getting feedback on the meantime.","closed","feature,","natalie-zamani","2021-07-22T23:51:24Z","2021-07-23T16:43:35Z"
"","3576","Added DualSessionFactory component within the existing Hibernate Unit…","…OfWork framework.  ###### Problem: Modern RDBMS systems often provide read-replica clusters with separate access points. With regards to Hibernate, this requires two SessionFactory instances. One factory is for the primary/writer data source. And a separate factory is necessary for the read-replica data source. This requires the usage of the UnitOfWork name property whenever the read-replica is preferred. Ideally, no adjustments to the UnitOfWork properties should be necessary if the readOnly is properly set across endpoints.  ###### Solution: This commit provides a SessionFactory implementation that contains both a writer/primary factory and a reader factory. The DualSessionFactory comes with separate HibernateBundle, UnitOfWorkApplicationListener, and UnitOfWorkAspect classes. Prior to usage, the UnitOfWorkAspect class prepares the DualSessionFactory based on the UnitOfWork annotation readOnly property. When the dual HibernateBundle is dropped into an application, the UnitOfWork requires no changes across endpoints assuming that the readOnly property is already set accordingly.  https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/3542  ###### Result: This commit contains new DualSessionFactory, HibernateBundle, UnitOfWorkApplicationListener, and UnitOfWorkAspect classes.","closed","","smalleyd2","2020-11-25T19:43:11Z","2020-11-26T16:13:18Z"
"","3973","AssetServlet: Use MIME type of index file for directory requests","With this change the extension of the index file is used do determine the content type of responses of requests to directories.  Background: I have written a filter which uses a servlet extending `AssetServlet` to serve static resources at the same path level as Jersey resources (for example, it’s possible to have dynamic Jersey resources at `/someResource` while also serving static content at paths like `/`, `/robots.txt` and `/favicon.ico`). Currently the servlet replaces the `HttpServletRequest` with a [proxy](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html) which replaces the return value of `getRequestURI()` with the URI of the index file if the real request URI ends with `/`. This change eliminates the need for the (somewhat ugly) proxy.  If desired, I could provide the code for the filter and servlet in another pull request.","closed","improvement,","maffe","2021-05-17T21:27:03Z","2021-05-20T21:24:31Z"

"","3796","Problems with custom deserializers during configuration deserialization","When defining custom configuration with custom properties, e.g: ``` import io.dropwizard.Configuration;  public class CustomConfiguration extends Configuration {      private CustomProperty customProperty;      public CustomProperty getCustomProperty() {         return customProperty;     }      public CustomConfiguration setCustomProperty(CustomProperty customProperty) {         this.customProperty = customProperty;         return this;     } } ``` and using custom deserializer for said property: ``` import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonDeserialize;  @JsonDeserialize(using = CustomDeserializer.class) public class CustomProperty  {      // doesn't matter } ``` the `JsonParser parser` passed to deserialize method has `getCodec()` as `null`: ``` import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser; import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDeserializer;  import java.io.IOException;  public class CustomDeserializer extends StdDeserializer {      public CustomDeserializer() {         super(CustomProperty.class);     }      @Override     public CustomProperty deserialize(JsonParser parser, DeserializationContext context) throws IOException {           // throws exception as parser.getCodec() is null           TreeNode treeNode = parser.readValueAsTree();           // the rest doesn't matter     } } ``` This makes using custom deserializers for configuration properties quite difficult, as you would need to forward proper `ObjectCodec` to deserializer somehow and set it on parser before calling read methods.  It seems that it can be fixed by calling proper `TreeTraversingParser` constructor that accepts `ObjectCodec` in `io.dropwizard.configuration.BaseConfigurationFactory`.  It also seems that similar issue was discussed in #1991 which was closed because of inactivity.","closed","bug,","IdamkinI","2021-03-19T17:35:55Z","2021-03-21T11:10:17Z"

"","3649","DropwizardAppExtension support for RegisterExtension","This PR enables us to use DropwizardAppExtension with JUnit 5's ""RegisterExtension"" annotation.  ###### Problem: We're adding JUnit 5 capabilities to our open source framework [sda-dropwizard-commons](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-dropwizard-commons/). We noticed that JUnit 4's RuleChain is no longer available and are looking for a different solution to specify the order of the execution of the extensions. This is needed to spin up a service (e.g. with Wiremock) beforehand and configure URLs and ports in our application afterwards.  JUnit 5 provides these solutions as far as I know: - declare the order by enumerating all extensions in your `ExtendWith` annotation - declare the order by the order of the fields that have a `RegisterExtension` annotation - you can also add an `Order` annotation to the fields that already have the `RegisterExtension` annotation.  Unfortunately you can't mix these two approaches very well.  You can find more information in the [official documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration).  We need to use the programmatic extension registration to be able to configure the test resources in most cases. Declaratice extension is not an alternative.  ###### Solution:  We'd like the existing DropwizardAppExtension support the programmatic approach. The only thing that needs to be added are two interfaces. I don't see any disadvantages - I even think using this approach is even easier because you only need one line of code; no need to also add `ExtendWith` annotation.  ###### Result:  The changes we made are backwards compatible. The app extension can now be used with JUnit 5's `RegisterExtension`.  If you think the change is valid I'm happy to also add the new feature to the documentation. :)","closed","improvement,","christopher-cudennec","2021-01-11T07:27:18Z","2021-01-12T07:24:25Z"

"","3615","Dropwizard emits an error message whenever external logging is configured and Logback is excluded","This can be reproduced on 2.0.16 by simply following the instructions in the [documentation](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/manual/core.html#logging) in the _Note_ section beginning with _If you don’t want to use Logback ..._ The only symptom is that the following message is printed to standard error, but the server still starts up:  ``` io.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationMetadata.$1: Type ch.qos.logback.access.spi.IAccessEvent not present ```  This occurs while Hibernate is validating the deserialized configuration at the field `server.requestLog`, which is configured with `type: external` as instructed in that _Note_ section.  It looks like the root of the problem is that `LogbackAccessRequestLogFactory` pulls in the Logback dependency which is being excluded, and it is also the default implementation of `RequestLogFactory`, as defined with the [`JsonTypeInfo` annotation](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/05bdecbe59366d4c747aa2f0256dcd768bd6b6e6/dropwizard-request-logging/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/request/logging/RequestLogFactory.java#L12). So it is still being loaded when doing Hibernate validation on the config, even if it is not specified in the config.  This is the exception stacktrace that is getting swallowed when the message above is printed:  ``` java.lang.TypeNotPresentException: Type ch.qos.logback.access.spi.IAccessEvent not present 	at sun.reflect.generics.factory.CoreReflectionFactory.makeNamedType(CoreReflectionFactory.java:117) 	at sun.reflect.generics.visitor.Reifier.visitClassTypeSignature(Reifier.java:125) 	at sun.reflect.generics.tree.ClassTypeSignature.accept(ClassTypeSignature.java:49) 	at sun.reflect.generics.visitor.Reifier.reifyTypeArguments(Reifier.java:68) 	at sun.reflect.generics.visitor.Reifier.visitClassTypeSignature(Reifier.java:138) 	at sun.reflect.generics.tree.ClassTypeSignature.accept(ClassTypeSignature.java:49) 	at sun.reflect.generics.visitor.Reifier.reifyTypeArguments(Reifier.java:68) 	at sun.reflect.generics.visitor.Reifier.visitClassTypeSignature(Reifier.java:138) 	at sun.reflect.generics.tree.ClassTypeSignature.accept(ClassTypeSignature.java:49) 	at sun.reflect.generics.repository.MethodRepository.getReturnType(MethodRepository.java:68) 	at java.lang.reflect.Method.getGenericReturnType(Method.java:255) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.introspect.AnnotatedMethod.getType(AnnotatedMethod.java:77) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.introspect.POJOPropertyBuilder.getPrimaryType(POJOPropertyBuilder.java:341) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.introspect.POJOPropertyBuilder.getRawPrimaryType(POJOPropertyBuilder.java:365) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializerFactory.removeIgnorableTypes(BeanSerializerFactory.java:707) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializerFactory.findBeanProperties(BeanSerializerFactory.java:573) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializerFactory.constructBeanOrAddOnSerializer(BeanSerializerFactory.java:384) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializerFactory.findBeanOrAddOnSerializer(BeanSerializerFactory.java:286) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializerFactory._createSerializer2(BeanSerializerFactory.java:231) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializerFactory.createSerializer(BeanSerializerFactory.java:165) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializerProvider._createUntypedSerializer(SerializerProvider.java:1474) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializerProvider._createAndCacheUntypedSerializer(SerializerProvider.java:1442) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializerProvider.findValueSerializer(SerializerProvider.java:562) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.DefaultSerializerProvider.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(DefaultSerializerProvider.java:566) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(ObjectMapper.java:4358) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(ObjectMapper.java:4337) 	at io.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationMetadata$1.optionalProperty(ConfigurationMetadata.java:164) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanPropertyWriter.depositSchemaProperty(BeanPropertyWriter.java:840) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.BeanSerializerBase.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(BeanSerializerBase.java:897) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.DefaultSerializerProvider.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(DefaultSerializerProvider.java:566) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(ObjectMapper.java:4358) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(ObjectMapper.java:4337) 	at io.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationMetadata$1.optionalProperty(ConfigurationMetadata.java:164) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanPropertyWriter.depositSchemaProperty(BeanPropertyWriter.java:840) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.BeanSerializerBase.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(BeanSerializerBase.java:897) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.DefaultSerializerProvider.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(DefaultSerializerProvider.java:566) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(ObjectMapper.java:4358) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.acceptJsonFormatVisitor(ObjectMapper.java:4337) 	at io.dropwizard.configuration.ConfigurationMetadata.(ConfigurationMetadata.java:76) 	at io.dropwizard.configuration.BaseConfigurationFactory.(BaseConfigurationFactory.java:76) 	at io.dropwizard.configuration.YamlConfigurationFactory.(YamlConfigurationFactory.java:29) 	at io.dropwizard.configuration.DefaultConfigurationFactoryFactory.create(DefaultConfigurationFactoryFactory.java:18) ...

Like I said, this is relatively benign, but it is still annoying enough that I added back the ""logback-access"" dependency, and that silenced the error message. That's a reasonable workaround for now, but Logback's most recent stable release is from 2017 and certain scanning tools are already flagging it for known vulnerabilities, so it isn't ideal to pull it in as a dependency if it is not used.  _Originally posted by @adriansuarez in https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2476#issuecomment-748706160_","closed","","adriansuarez","2020-12-23T21:31:42Z","2021-01-09T23:29:44Z"

As denoted in #1630, injection does not work on instances registered in the DynamicFeature's context.  However, one can provide the injection manually. With the following code I get the `HttpServletRequest` injected into my `AuthFilter` instance:  ```java public class InjectingFeature implements Feature {     private static class InjectingDynamicFeature implements DynamicFeature {         private final InjectionManager injectionManager;          InjectingDynamicFeature(InjectionManager manager) {             injectionManager = manager;         }          @Override         public void configure(ResourceInfo resourceInfo, FeatureContext context) {             context.register(new InjectingContainerRequestFilter(injectionManager, context.getConfiguration()));         }     }      @Priority(1)     private static class InjectingContainerRequestFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {         private final InjectionManager injectionManager;         private final Configuration configuration;          InjectingContainerRequestFilter(InjectionManager manager, Configuration config) {             injectionManager = manager;             configuration = config;         }          @Override         public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext) throws IOException {             Set instances = configuration.getInstances();             for (Object instance : instances) {                 if (!this.getClass().equals(instance.getClass())) {                     injectionManager.inject(instance);                 }             }         }     }      @Override     public boolean configure(FeatureContext context) {         context.register(new InjectingDynamicFeature(InjectionManagerProvider.getInjectionManager(context)));         return true;     } } ```  I wonder, if the framework could/should provide such an implementation to make injection work on those instances registered in `DynamicFeature`s.  Maybe it would also be reasonable to provide this only for `AuthFilter` instances, as few other components are registered in this way. Then, the injection could also be extended to the `Authenticator` and `Authorizer` instances.","closed","","zUniQueX","2021-09-05T10:21:31Z","2022-04-05T15:02:19Z"

While admittedly they are different things and have very different rules, is there openness to syncing the admin context up better with the app context?  If yes to the general question, then in particular, would there be openness to auto-registering the ThreadNameFilter per the same rules as the app scope?  Specifically, in AbstractServerFactory, we have:  ``` protected Handler createAppServlet(Server server,                                        JerseyEnvironment jersey,                                        ObjectMapper objectMapper,                                        Validator validator,                                        MutableServletContextHandler handler,                                        @Nullable Servlet jerseyContainer,                                        MetricRegistry metricRegistry) {         ...          if (enableThreadNameFilter) {             handler.addFilter(ThreadNameFilter.class, ""/*"", EnumSet.of(DispatcherType.REQUEST));         }         ... ```  How about adding the same ""if"" block to createAdminServlet(...) such that if enableThreadNameFilter is true, we add the filter in both admin and app scopes?    ---  Is there openness to this type of change?  If so, happy to raise a PR.    My one concern is that we should probably call this out in the release notes.  For instance, in case someone has manually been registering ThreadNameFilter themselves and then they upgrade to the new DW version, getting 2x registration without realizing it when they upgrade.

The Afterburner implementation now [has a replacement](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-12-features-eee9456fec75) ([Blackbird](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-base/tree/master/blackbird)), due to potential compatibility issues with Java 9 and later.  The current implementation requires that consumers have to completely replace the `Bootstrap`-created `ObjectMapper` instance in order to switch to Blackbird, as it's initialized using `Jackson.newObjectMapper()`. Given that Jackson is continuously evolving, it would be helpful if the dependencies could be decoupled.  One possible solution would be to have the dependencies on the [various external implementations be optional](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html), and only enabled automatically if present on the classpath. This would allow the `Jackson` implementation to auto-configure based on the consumer needs, while still providing an opinionated configuration capability.","closed","","mschechter-bellese","2021-01-13T12:45:26Z","2021-03-21T11:10:32Z"

Feel free to close because you've already addressed this in DW 2.1.x, but if anyone else sees this output when migrating a db in the context of integration tests: you're not alone, you're not crazy, and it doesn't seem to matter.  (You can force a 4.x dependency if sufficiently offended -- I did and it works fine.)  ``` ERROR [2021-07-01 15:25:06,069] liquibase.util.LiquibaseUtil: Cannot read liquibase.build.properties ! java.io.IOException: Found 2 files that match liquibase.build.properties ! at liquibase.util.StreamUtil.singleInputStream(StreamUtil.java:206) ! at liquibase.util.StreamUtil.openFromClasspath(StreamUtil.java:241) ! at liquibase.util.StreamUtil.openStream(StreamUtil.java:151) ! at liquibase.util.LiquibaseUtil.getBuildInfo(LiquibaseUtil.java:31) ! at liquibase.util.LiquibaseUtil.getBuildVersion(LiquibaseUtil.java:15) ! at liquibase.sqlgenerator.core.MarkChangeSetRanGenerator.generateSql(MarkChangeSetRanGenerator.java:95) ! at liquibase.sqlgenerator.core.MarkChangeSetRanGenerator.generateSql(MarkChangeSetRanGenerator.java:25) ! at liquibase.sqlgenerator.SqlGeneratorChain.generateSql(SqlGeneratorChain.java:30) ! at liquibase.sqlgenerator.SqlGeneratorFactory.generateSql(SqlGeneratorFactory.java:222) ! at liquibase.executor.AbstractExecutor.applyVisitors(AbstractExecutor.java:105) ! at liquibase.executor.jvm.JdbcExecutor.access$600(JdbcExecutor.java:43) ! at liquibase.executor.jvm.JdbcExecutor$ExecuteStatementCallback.doInStatement(JdbcExecutor.java:412) ! at liquibase.executor.jvm.JdbcExecutor.execute(JdbcExecutor.java:87) ! at liquibase.executor.jvm.JdbcExecutor.execute(JdbcExecutor.java:159) ! at liquibase.executor.jvm.JdbcExecutor.execute(JdbcExecutor.java:139) ! at liquibase.changelog.StandardChangeLogHistoryService.setExecType(StandardChangeLogHistoryService.java:388) ! at liquibase.database.AbstractJdbcDatabase.markChangeSetExecStatus(AbstractJdbcDatabase.java:1133) ! at liquibase.changelog.visitor.UpdateVisitor.visit(UpdateVisitor.java:64) ! at liquibase.changelog.ChangeLogIterator.run(ChangeLogIterator.java:97) ! at liquibase.Liquibase.update(Liquibase.java:201) ! at liquibase.Liquibase.update(Liquibase.java:178) ! at liquibase.Liquibase.update(Liquibase.java:174) ! at liquibase.Liquibase.update(Liquibase.java:167) ! at io.dropwizard.migrations.DbMigrateCommand.run(DbMigrateCommand.java:65) ! at io.dropwizard.migrations.DbCommand.run(DbCommand.java:55) ! at io.dropwizard.migrations.AbstractLiquibaseCommand.run(AbstractLiquibaseCommand.java:68) ! at io.dropwizard.cli.ConfiguredCommand.run(ConfiguredCommand.java:98) ! at io.dropwizard.cli.Cli.run(Cli.java:78) ! at io.dropwizard.Application.run(Application.java:94) ! at com.enterprise.resources.AbstractResourceIT.setUpDatabases(AbstractResourceIT.java:54) ! at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) ! at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) ! at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) ! at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498) ! at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:59) ! at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12) ! at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:56) ! at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.invokeMethod(RunBefores.java:33) ! at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:24) ! at org.junit.rules.ExternalResource$1.evaluate(ExternalResource.java:54) ! at org.junit.rules.RunRules.evaluate(RunRules.java:20) ! at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:306) ! at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:413) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.execute(JUnit4Provider.java:365) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.executeWithRerun(JUnit4Provider.java:273) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.executeTestSet(JUnit4Provider.java:238) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.invoke(JUnit4Provider.java:159) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter.invokeProviderInSameClassLoader(ForkedBooter.java:384) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter.runSuitesInProcess(ForkedBooter.java:345) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter.execute(ForkedBooter.java:126) ! at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter.main(ForkedBooter.java:418) INFO  [2021-07-01 15:25:06,248] liquibase.changelog.ChangeSet: Custom SQL executed INFO  [2021-07-01 15:25:06,248] liquibase.changelog.ChangeSet: ChangeSet migrations.sql::85::cptnkirk ran successfully in 174ms  ```","closed","stale,","johnv-git","2021-07-01T22:36:55Z","2022-02-03T00:06:34Z"

I don't think having sonar grumbling is necessarily a bad thing, but if it's configured it would be nice if it had a clean report.  The issues:  - ~~[dropwizard-auth ChainedAuthFilter](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=dropwizard_dropwizard&open=AXUXdIbmpBosHuY9-P1w&resolved=false&types=BUG) can potentially throw an exception which can potentially be null.

This is possibly bad - should an extra `catch` clause be added? I'm not sure and threads scare me.~~ :heavy_check_mark: addressed with https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/4239 - ~~[dropwizard-lifecycle ExecutorServiceBuilder](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=dropwizard_dropwizard&open=AXUXdI01pBosHuY9-P9n&resolved=false&types=BUG) ignores the result of String.format, but intentionally so as it's using the call to check that the format string is valid. Sonar will stop complaining if it's wrapped in an explicit try-catch, but adding unnecessary code just to please Sonar isn't great. `@SuppressWarnings(""ResultOfMethodCallIgnored"")` doesn't seem to appease Sonar - is there anything else which will?~~ :heavy_check_mark: addressed with https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/4277 ~~- [dropwizard-logging LoggingUtil](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=dropwizard_dropwizard&open=AXUXdIKxpBosHuY9-Pub&resolved=false&types=BUG) - another potential swallowing of an `InterruptedException`.

It requires specifying the renderers to use so it doesn't conflict with the default Freemarker one. I use it as follows:  ```java final var renderer = new FreemarkerPathViewRenderer(); bootstrap.addBundle(new ViewBundle<>(Collections.singletonList(renderer)) {   @Override   public Map> getViewConfiguration(v2Configuration config) {     return config.getViewConfig();   }   @Override   public void run(v2Configuration configuration, Environment environment) throws Exception {     renderer.setTemplateDirectory(new File(configuration.getViewsConfig().getViewTemplatesPath()));     super.run(configuration, environment);   } }); ``` It only works if a view's template name is absolute. I didn't investigate because I was already doing that (adding the template directory's parent to the classpath, which doesn't work with IntelliJ).  I'd like to contribute it to the project, after figuring out how to avoid a conflict with the current one, since renderers are loaded as services that implement ViewRenderer and these two would both try to handle the same file types. (And I'm currently using the same configuration key).  Thoughts?","closed","","mlilback","2021-08-18T16:41:30Z","2022-02-27T20:22:18Z"

"","3685","Syslog appender intermittently losing messages from a Dropwizard command","I have two different DropWizard components, currently using DW 2.0.16. One component is a fairly typical HTTP service. The other is just a CLI application, implementing a handful of DW commands. Both are configured to use the syslog appender to send certain messages to an Rsyslog service (running in CentOS 8.2)  The messages generated from the HTTP service are all arriving at the Rsyslog service as expected, and getting handled correctly. But the messages generated from the CLI commands are intermittently not arriving. Sometimes about half of them arrive and get logged, sometimes less than that.  My guess is that DropWizard's use of an async appender is causing the log messages to be queued for a worker thread to eventually pick up, but that thread is failing to pick up all the messages because the command completes and exits quickly. But that is just a theory that is consistent with the limited data I have.  Looking for ideas to find out of this is a DropWizard bug, or a misconfiguration on my part. And most importantly, I am eager to find a workaround.","closed","bug,","TimothyMDean","2021-02-05T21:03:13Z","2022-04-14T21:12:20Z"

Looking at [MDN's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since) for these headers, I'm of the understanding that `If-Modified-Since` should be ignored when `If-None-Match` is present.    As an example of how this causes problems, we have a scenario where two different `index.html` assets are served from the same URL depending on configuration.  Since both these files are packaged in the same jar, the modified timestamps are the same but the ETag is different.  Unfortunately, changing the configuration and restarting the server results in the browser's cache being used because the server is responding 304 (different ETag but same modification date).","closed","bug,","bmsq","2021-02-25T06:16:10Z","2021-03-17T15:05:24Z"

"","3622","@QueryParam and OptionalInt are not working as documented","Hi!  In [this](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/manual/core.html#parameters) part of core documentation I found the following:  A `@QueryParam(""count"")`-annotated `OptionalInt` parameter takes the first `count` value from the request’s query string and passes it as a `String` to `OptionalInt`’s constructor. `OptionalInt` parses the string as an `Integer`, returning a `400 Bad Request` if the value is malformed.  The most important part for me is the last sentence. I read it as ""if someone calls your endpoint with something like `?count=qwe` he will get `400 Bad Request` because we explicitly expecting count to be an integer"". I have tried it myself and found a different behavior. Instead of returning `400 Bad Request` I got empty `OptionalInt` in the annotated method parameter.  Example code: ```java @Slf4j @Path(""/hello"") @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public class GreetingResource {     @GET     public void getLastRegistered(@QueryParam(""count"") OptionalInt count) {         // according to docs app should return 400 Bad Request before even stepping into the method if passed count=qwe         if (!count.isPresent()) {             log.error(""But instead it makes count an empty OptionalInt and continues"");         }     } } ```  Of course, we can check for it and throw `WebApplicationException` with `400 Bad Request` explicitly in this case but that should be mentioned in the docs, right?  First sentence of mentioned block is also strange. It says:  A `@QueryParam(""count"")`-annotated `OptionalInt` parameter takes the first `count` value from the request’s query string and passes it as a `String` to `OptionalInt`’s constructor.  In fact, `OptionalInt` doesn't have constructor with String parameter.   Something is definitely converting `String` to `OptionalInt` but differently.  P.S. I tried to replace method parameter type `OptionalInt` with just `int`. In this case endpoint returns `404 Not Found` which is odd too. If the requestor failed composing a vaild request by passing `qwe` into integer field he should get `400 Bad Request`, not `404 Not Found`. But I guess that's a question to Jersey.","closed","stale,","muRn","2020-12-27T19:31:53Z","2022-01-21T00:04:41Z"

"","3907","Concern about Liquibase Hub","Hello! This is not as much an issue about Dropwizard, but I wanted to express a small concern I got about Liquibase yesterday, when attempting to upgrade from v3 (3.6.3) to v4 (4.3.4).  I maintain an application which uses Dropwizard, and we like to stay ahead and keep our dependencies updated. We use the, at time of writing, latest Dropwizard v2.0.21. It may also be that we override some dependencies in `dropwizard-dependencies` to later versions, if we see that they work.  One such dependency is Liquibase, which we have actually overridden to stay on version 3.6.3 now for quite a long time. Mainly because we experienced some differences in how Liquibase generates SQL from v3.7.0 which made our migrations break, and we didn't invest time in resolving it because 3.6.3 worked just fine, and it is not really being used for anything during runtime. However yesterday I decided to try to finally bring Liquibase to latest-greatest. Resolving the anomalies for the migrations was easy, so that was nothing to worry about. But when testing and running the migrations I noticed some warnings being logged, looking like this: ``` WARN  liquibase.hub.HubUpdater - Skipping auto-registration WARNING: The changelog file specified is not registered with any Liquibase Hub project, so the results will not be recorded in Liquibase Hub. To register the changelog with your Hub Project run 'liquibase registerchangelog'. Learn more at https://hub.liquibase.com ``` Which made me a bit curious of this [Liquibase Hub](https://hub.liquibase.com/), which it looks like it is something it want to contact during our database migrations. In short, it looks to be some kind of analysis tool for displaying insights into your migrations. After some digging and debugging, I think I have verified that it actually does _not_ connect to Liquibase Hub to send anything about our database schema, but it _strongly_ nudges to register an account and set up so that data about your database seems to be sent to Liquibase each time a migration is performed.  Setting the system property `liquibase.hub.mode=OFF` disables the Liquibase Hub feature. But, in our migration setup for our automated tests, we run [Liquibase.dropAll](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/blob/master/liquibase-core/src/main/java/liquibase/Liquibase.java#L1758-L1763), and for that I _also_ had to make sure that I use a _separate_ `Liquibase` instance where `changeLog` is explicitly set to `null`, or I would get the aforementioned warning, even though I had set the system property `liquibase.hub.mode=OFF`. It does not seem like the `DropAllCommand` in liquibase takes the system property into account.  All this makes me a bit uneasy about Liquibase, to be honest. Yes, it will seemingly not send anything as long as you have not configured an API-key to connect to their Liquibase Hub API, but it took me a bit off-guard that they are actually thinking of sending lots of data about our database to their servers, and also having it as a sort of, and a bit hidden tbh, opt-out feature. If you decide to do as the warnings advise you to, according to their FAQ they will send ""Changeset body from the changelog"", ""Generated SQL executed by the Liquibase core app"", and ""Two types of logs: operation-event and change-event"".  I see that Liquibase v4 is planned for the 2.1 release of Dropwizard, so I wanted to ask if you have any thoughts on this? Have you noticed this behaviour? I do not wish to be dramatic about this, am I overreacting or is this a legitimate concern? Maybe there are some insight here as well that is applicable for incorporating into Dropwizard.  Thanks for reading my rambling wall-of-text, and thanks for making Dropwizard! :)","closed","needs code,","runeflobakk","2021-04-27T10:03:02Z","2022-02-19T11:28:42Z"
"","3769","The dropwizard-dependencies bom has declared some dependencies with scope","Hello Dropwizard folks.  When importing the dropwizard-dependencies BOM, we noticed two dependencies in the BOM have a declared scope of `runtime`: - `jakarta.activation-api`     - https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-dependencies/pom.xml#L165 - `jakarta.xml.bind-api`     - https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-dependencies/pom.xml#L176  Usually with published BOMs like this you don't want to include scope since it will override the scope of transitive dependencies of projects that import the BOM and that can have confusing side effects.  Is this something that could be changed?  We have to currently explicitly override this for our apps to use the dropwizard-dependencies BOM because otherwise it breaks a few of our imported libraries that have one of these two dependencies.

"","4205","DropwizardExtensionsSupport fails to call DropwizardExtension.after() in some situations (complex test class structure)","DropwizardExtensionsSupport's reflection logic fails to call DropwizardExtension.after() in some situations involving complex class structures.  ----  Specific situation that impacted us: 1.  Inheritance of the test classes is in use; base class is abstract. 2. Base class has an inner/nested class. 3. Derived class has the DropwizardExtension member.  (Extension / extension's resources are used/accessed from the base class via implementation of various abstract methods.)  When the base class's inner/nested class's test methods run, the before() method is invoked on the DropwizardExtension but not the after() method.  This causes various resource/thread leaks (depends on the type of DropwizardExtension in use).  Practically speaking, when we were using DropwizardResource, we saw a large number of leaked threads due to the GrizzlyWebTestContainerFactory being started repeatedly (per test) while it was only inconsistently being stopped.  ----  Looking at DropwizardExtensionsSupport's code, we see that the afterEach() logic does not quite match the beforeEach() logic.  BeforeEach: ```     @Override     public void beforeEach(ExtensionContext extensionContext) throws Exception {         final Object testInstance = extensionContext.getTestInstance()                 .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalStateException(""Unable to get the current test instance""));         try {             beforeEach(testInstance, testInstance.getClass());         } catch (Exception e) {             throw e;         } catch (Throwable e) {             throw new Exception(e);         }     }      private void beforeEach(Object testInstance, Class cls) throws Throwable {         final Class enclosingClass = cls.getEnclosingClass();         if (enclosingClass != null) {             final Object enclosing = getEnclosingInstance(testInstance);             if (enclosing != null) {                 beforeEach(enclosing, cls);             }         }         for (Field member : findAnnotatedFields(testInstance.getClass(), false)) {             getDropwizardExtension(member, testInstance).before();         }     } ```  AfterEach: ```     @Override     public void afterEach(ExtensionContext extensionContext) throws Exception {         final Object testInstance = extensionContext.getTestInstance()                 .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalStateException(""Unable to get the current test instance""));         try {             afterEach(testInstance, testInstance.getClass());         } catch (Exception e) {             throw e;         } catch (Throwable e) {             throw new Exception(e);         }     }      private void afterEach(Object testInstance, Class cls) throws Throwable {         final Class enclosingClass = testInstance.getClass().getEnclosingClass();         if (enclosingClass != null) {             final Object enclosing = getEnclosingInstance(testInstance);             if (enclosing != null) {                 afterEach(enclosing, enclosingClass);             }         }         for (Field member : findAnnotatedFields(cls, false)) {             getDropwizardExtension(member, testInstance).after();         }     } ```  Notably, `findAnnotatedFields(cls, false))` is used in afterEach() instead of `findAnnotatedFields(testInstance.getClass(), false))`.  And enclosingClass is computed differently earlier in the method.  As a result, in the listed scenario, afterEach() logic tries to only find DropwizardExtension members defined on the abstract parent class (which does not have the member), thus, after() is skipped.  The beforeEach() logic correctly finds the DropwizardExtension on the derived class.  ---  Working on a PR.  Starting by adding some tests that reproduce the issue and also try to check for any other similar bugs.  Admittedly it's getting difficult to envision all possible inheritance hierarchies...  The other issue is that I'm really struggling to understand the original intent of the logic.  Specifically, the `Class cls` parameter -- what is that supposed to represent?  Namely: 1. Is it the class of the *original* testInstance parameter ... i.e. before enclosingClass lookups happened? 2. Is it the class of the *current* testInstance parameter?  Regardless of these questions about the original intent, I think maybe the simple solution is to take an apathy pill ;-) and just   A. synchronize the logic between the two methods.  AND B. make the various tests I'm adding (to ensure things work correctly) pass.    IDK.  To that end, I simply standardized my pending fixes around the beforeEach() implementation, since it seems to work.","closed","bug,","accwebs","2021-08-23T18:06:01Z","2021-10-26T08:16:09Z"

Release notes Sourced from testcontainers-bom's releases.  1.15.0 What's Changed Notable changes from previous release candidates (1.15.0-rc1, 1.15.0-rc2) are called out in these release notes. If migrating from 1.14.3, please see the RC release notes for other changes. 🚀 Features & Enhancements   🎉 Image substitution (#3102) @rnorth This change introduces a mechanism for programmatic image name substitution, as one of a number of mitigations for Docker Hub image pull rate limiting. For more information, please see the documentation.   🥳 Add GCloud module for Google Cloud Datastore, Firestore, PubSub, and Spanner emulators (#2690) @eddumelendez For more information, please check out the documentation for this module!   Included in 1.15.0-rc2   Add image compatibility checks (#3021) @rnorth The majority of modules make assumptions about the container image being used - for example, port numbers, expected log lines, etc. When asking users to provide their own images with modules, it is potentially confusing if the provided image diverges from the original 'vendor-provided' image that the module was built to support. This change is intended to ensure that, if the user provides their own image that is not the same as the vendor-provided one, they are given adequate warning and forced to signal that this is intentional. For example:  new KafkaContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""confluentinc/cp-kafka:any"")) will just work, because confluentinc/cp-kafka matches the image name that KafkaContainer was designed to work with but new KafkaContainer(DockerImageName.parse(""some-other-kafka"")) will not work immediately, because some-other-kafka may be an entirely divergent image from confluentinc/cp-kafka. In this case, the user would be prompted to add .asCompatibleSubstituteFor(""confluentinc/cp-kafka"") which tells Testcontainers that this is a conscious decision  This PR adds to DockerImageName:  asCompatibleSubstituteFor(DockerImageName) and asCompatibleSubstituteFor(String) methods which may be used to claim compatibility with a vendor-provided image isCompatibleWith(DockerImageName) and assertCompatibleWith(DockerImageName) methods which can be used by Testcontainers to check that the provided image is compatible with the expected vendor-provided image    Included in 1.15.0-rc1   Add a rootless Docker strategy (#2985) @bsideup. This allows Testcontainers to be used with Docker's rootless mode. All Testcontainers' features and modules are compatible with Docker rootless mode, but we would appreciate feedback on unidentified edge cases.   Deprecate ambiguous constructors (#2839) @rnorth. This change affects the majority of constructors for container classes. This is intended to encourage users to specify an exact docker image and tag for dependencies, rather than relying on a (potentially outdated) default image chosen by Testcontainers.  new XyzContainer()-style and new XyzContainer(String)-style constructors are deprecated throughout, in favour of a strongly typed new XyzContainer(DockerImageName)-style constructor. Users should identify an appropriate Docker image for their test dependencies, and use as follows: new XyzContainer( DockerImageName.parse( ""the/image:tag"" ) ). We expect to make some further improvements in this area before the final 1.15.0 release.    Un-shade docker-java-api (#2882) @bsideup. This change follows some significant refactoring of the docker-java library, and should resolve various issues associated with shading of dependencies.   New optional transport based on Apache HttpClient5. This is a very promising transport that most probably will become the default in future versions of Testcontainers. You can give it a try by putting transport.type = httpclient5 to $HOME/.testcontainers.properties.   ⚠️ Breaking API changes Included in 1.15.0-rc1 While we expect that the vast majority of users will notice no difference, these changes can be considered breaking, so warrant special mention:   ...

Release 5.8.0 Features  #1313: Normalize RESOURCE_PREFIX for darwin to darwin-$arch and split jnidispatch library per architecture - @​matthiasblaesing. #1318: Add support for linux-riscv64 - @​thentschel. #1327: Add partial support for future values of c.s.j.p.win32.WinNT.LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_RELATIONSHIP enum present in Windows Insider builds - @​dbwiddis.  Bug Fixes  #1317: Change the maven coordinates of the JPMS artifacts from classifier jpms to custom artifact ids jna-jpms and jna-platform-jpms - @​matthiasblaesing. #1322: Handle 0-length domain names in c.s.j.p.win32.Advapi32Util#getAccountBySid - @​dbwiddis. #1326: Ensure pointers indirected from Memory and pointing into Memory retain originating object - @​matthiasblaesing.  Important Changes   The maven coordinates of the experimental JPMS (java module system) artifacts were moved from using the classifier jpms to custom artifact ids jna-jpms and jna-platform-jpms, without an classifier. The reason for this is, that the platform artifacts depend on the jna artifacts and need to pull in the right variant. This is not possible if the classifier is used.   RESOURCE_PREFIX for darwin (mac OS) was changed from darwin to darwin-$arch as the fat binaries on mac OS causes various problems: It was reported, that binaries were rejected from the appstore because x86 binaries were found in the application (jnidispatch for mac OS x86) and that builds needed to be special cased so that the native library can be assembled. The latter is also true for JNA. While the prefix is changed, the old prefix is still searched as a fallback location, so if only a fat binary is present, it can still be loaded.

The -AwarnUnneededSuppressions command-line option warns only about suppression strings that contain a checker name. The -AwarnUnneededSuppressionsExceptions=REGEX command-line option partially disables -AwarnUnneededSuppressions.  Most users don't need this. Implementation details: Added classes SubtypeIsSubsetQualifierHierarchy and SubtypeIsSupersetQualifierHierarchy. Moved the contractsUtils field from the visitor to the type factory. Class renamings:  ContractsUtils => ContractsFromMethod  Method renamings:  ElementUtils.getVerboseName => ElementUtils.getQualifiedName ElementUtils.getSimpleName => ElementUtils.getSimpleSignature  Field renamings:  AnnotatedTypeMirror.actualType => AnnotatedTypeMirror.underlyingType  Added a formal parameter to methods in MostlyNoElementQualifierHierarchy:  leastUpperBoundWithElements greatestLowerBoundWithElements  Removed a formal parameter from methods in BaseTypeVisitor:  checkPostcondition checkConditionalPostcondition  In Analysis.runAnalysisFor(), changed boolean parameter to enum BeforeOrAfter. Removed org.checkerframework.framework.util.AnnotatedTypes#getIteratedType; use AnnotatedTypeFactory#getIterableElementType(ExpressionTree) instead.

Changelog 4.1.0 (2021-05-08)   Upgraded to Scala from 2.13.3 to 2.13.5 (thanks to sullis for pull request)   Upgraded Kotlin from 1.3.72 to 1.5.0   Fixed a bug preventing you to specify ""fib(-1)"" when using the fibonacci poll interval (thanks to Björn Michael for pull request) (issue 201)   Added support for fail-fast conditions. This is a special condition that, if fulfilled, will throw a ""org.awaitility.core.TerminalFailureException"" immediately, thus failing the test. This is good when you have a condition that you know beforehand should never be fulfilled. So instead of waiting the full duration of a normal condition evaluation period, the test will fail faster if this (fail fast) condition evaluates to true. For example: await().timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5)).failFast(() -> orders.findById(1234).state == PAID).until(() -> orders.findById(1234).state == CLOSED); This will fail-fast if the state of order 1234 is ever equal to ""PAID"" during the 5 second evaluation of the condition specified in ""until"".

"","4290","Dropwizard-jetty/core pulls in javax.servlet transitively","At my workplace, we are currently transitioning from Dropwizard 1.x to 2.x (2.0.20 in particular). At the same time, we are replacing all the javax dependencies in our codebase with jakarta dependencies. One thing we noticed is that while Dropwiard has made an effort to depend only on jakarta dependencies, it still manages to transitively pull in some of the older javax dependencies, specifically javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api.  Now, I am not very comfortable with maven -- we use Gradle at work, so I can only provide a reproducible example in gradle terms, but I imagine everything is transferable. Take this example build.gradle file: ``` apply plugin: 'java'  dependencies {     implementation 'io.dropwizard:dropwiard-core:2.0.25' } ``` Then, I can execute the `:dependencies` task on the project and gradle will list a tree of all dependencies (including transitive) for the project. If we search specifically for javax dependencies using the following command, we can see that javax.servlet-api is in fact pulled in transitively (even though after looking through Dropwizard's POMs that there is a large effort to exclude javax.servlet-api from the transitive dependencies elsewhere).  ``` # Command: ./gradlew :dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath | grep javax -B 5  # Output:        +--- io.dropwizard:dropwizard-metrics:2.0.25        |    +--- io.dropwizard:dropwizard-lifecycle:2.0.25        |    |    +--- com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2        |    |    +--- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.32        |    |    +--- org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server:9.4.43.v20210629        |    |    |    +--- javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.1.0 ``` You can see jetty-server pulls in javax.servlet-api here, or at least that's what the dependency tree is saying here. In fact, in [dropwizard-lifecycle's POM](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/v2.0.25/dropwizard-lifecycle/pom.xml#L24-L33) we can see that javax.servlet-api has been excluded. So why is it showing up here? Well, it's because there are other projects which depend on jetty-server, either directly or transitively which don't exclude javax.servlet-api.   From what I could dig up, the two culprits (at least in DW 2.0.20) are explicit dependencies on metrics-jetty9 and jetty-security. It seems that DW 2.0.23 fixed the jetty9 issue with [this commit](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/commit/4307b06daf5d35d7297c71ecec3c1024105d7d02), though 2.0.25 still depends on jetty-security without excluding javax.servlet-api (jetty-security depends on jetty-server which depends on javax.servlet-api)  Take for example the following build.gradle file and we run the same command as above.  ``` apply plugin: 'java'  dependencies {     implementation 'io.dropwizard:dropwiard-jetty:2.0.25' } ``` Running the same command as above, we get the following output: ```        +--- org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-io:9.4.43.v20210629        |    \--- org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-util:9.4.43.v20210629        +--- org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-security:9.4.43.v20210629        |    \--- org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server:9.4.43.v20210629        |         +--- javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.1.0 ```  It appears DW depends on jetty-security twice, in [dropwizard-core](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/v2.0.25/dropwizard-core/pom.xml#L122-L125) and [dropwizard-jetty](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/v2.0.25/dropwizard-jetty/pom.xml#L56-L59). I believe we can fix this issue if we exclude javax.servlet-api from both of these dependency declarations.   Personally, I find it quite crazy how much manual dependency management needs to go on to avoid pulling in these old javax dependencies. It seems like Dropwizard is going through a lot of work to exclude these dependencies individually from each transitive dependency which may still be depending on them. In gradle world, we can just do something like below and we don't have to worry about javax.servlet-api polluting our classpath ever. I find it hard to believe maven dependencyManagement can't do something similar (though, as I said, I am not skilled with working directly with maven).  ``` configurations.all {     exclude group: 'javax.servlet' } ```  Even if we are able to resolve this issue with these two new exclusions, I am still curious if there is a way to blanket exclude these javax dependencies from ever being pulled in transitively, so that so much manual (and error-prone) work doesn't need to happen to exclude them. Further, perhaps for even more confidence that these javax (and other) excluded dependencies aren't included in the in the final dependency tree, what if Dropwizard added to the build some kind of check on the resolved dependencies to ensure that the final classpath does not contain any offending dependencies? IMO if there is a problem with a POM in that it pulls in a javax dependency, the build should fail.   Sorry for the long-winded issue. I wanted to provide as much detail as I could to try to best outline the issue I was seeing and provide reproducible examples and a potential solution (I haven't actually verified that the two exclusions I mentioned completely resolve the issue).

This class extends `AbstractHandlerContainer` but doesn't override `expandChildren` so Jetty can't continue looking for the SessionHandler.  _This is primarily an issue for scavenging the sessions from my `JDBCSessionDataStore`. Setting the SessionCache eviction policy to `EVICT_ON_INACTIVITY` will remove the sessions from the Cache, but that solves half the problem._  The solution would probably be to change the class to extend from `HandlerCollection` or to just override the `expandChildren` method.

Instead, setting the options `stale-issue-message` and `stale-pr-message` will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting `skip-stale-issue-message` to `true`. -   The `operations-per-run` option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls. In most cases, you can just increase this limit to make sure to process everything in a single run.    ---  ### Configuration  📅 **Schedule**: ""before 2am"" (UTC).  🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This bug can potentially cause unstable builds in some environments, manifesting as port wait timeouts at container startup. We recommend upgrading to 1.16.2 or higher.  Testcontainers 1.16.1 has been released! 🎉  This release brings a lot of eagerly awaited new features and fixes, such as:  ##### 🔮 Better Oracle Database support  Thanks to the engagement of the community and [@​gvenzl](https://togithub.com/gvenzl)'s new Docker images for [Oracle Database Express Edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/gvenzl/oracle-xe) we were able to update our `OracleContainer` module to ensure its compatibility with a wide range of Oracle XE versions.  And at the same time, thanks to the new images, we were able to re-integrate the Oracle module into our CI. This means we can verify compatibility for using Testcontainers with Oracle Database going forward.  ##### ☁️ New Azure Cosmos DB module  With the new Azure Comos DB module we finally added Azure to our list of cloud service testing facilities. It is based on Microsoft's [Azure Cosmos DB-Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21) and provides you with a way to do your integration testing without the need for an actual Azure service.  ```java public CosmosDBEmulatorContainer emulator = new CosmosDBEmulatorContainer(         DockerImageName.parse(""mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest"") ); ```  Please check out the [module docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/azure/) to learn how to use it for your integration testing needs.  ##### ⛴ Host port access for containers  For further improving the developer experience of our users, we added a new API to make hosts ports accessible to containers:      container.withAccessToHost(true)  You still need to use `exposeHostPorts`, [as per the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/networking/#exposing-host-ports-to-the-container), but **this can now be done after the container has started**, thereby allowing new usage patterns in your tests.  ##### 🌪 Faster Cassandra startup  By making clever use of the configuration settings available in Cassandra, `CassandraContainer` will now start up to 3 times faster. It is now also configured to be less resource hungry out of the box.  ##### ✨ Better startup performance for all containers  We found a couple of ways to improve the container startup performance for our users, no matter the Testcontainers module you use. This comes through some internal changes with regards to how Testcontainers checks for open ports during container startup and will shave up to a couple of seconds from your test suite.  ***  We are grateful for the ongoing support of our community and users and thank each of our awesome contributors!  ##### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -

And at the same time, thanks to the new images, we were able to re-integrate the Oracle module into our CI. This means we can verify compatibility for using Testcontainers with Oracle Database going forward.  ##### ☁️ New Azure Cosmos DB module  With the new Azure Comos DB module we finally added Azure to our list of cloud service testing facilities. It is based on Microsoft's [Azure Cosmos DB-Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21) and provides you with a way to do your integration testing without the need for an actual Azure service.  ```java public CosmosDBEmulatorContainer emulator = new CosmosDBEmulatorContainer(         DockerImageName.parse(""mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest"") ); ```  Please check out the [module docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/azure/) to learn how to use it for your integration testing needs.  ##### ⛴ Host port access for containers  For further improving the developer experience of our users, we added a new API to make hosts ports accessible to containers:      container.withAccessToHost(true)  You still need to use `exposeHostPorts`, [as per the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/networking/#exposing-host-ports-to-the-container), but **this can now be done after the container has started**, thereby allowing new usage patterns in your tests.  ##### 🌪 Faster Cassandra startup  By making clever use of the configuration settings available in Cassandra, `CassandraContainer` will now start up to 3 times faster. It is now also configured to be less resource hungry out of the box.  ##### ✨ Better startup performance for all containers  We found a couple of ways to improve the container startup performance for our users, no matter the Testcontainers module you use. This comes through some internal changes with regards to how Testcontainers checks for open ports during container startup and will shave up to a couple of seconds from your test suite.  ***  We are grateful for the ongoing support of our community and users and thank each of our awesome contributors!  ##### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -

And at the same time, thanks to the new images, we were able to re-integrate the Oracle module into our CI. This means we can verify compatibility for using Testcontainers with Oracle Database going forward.  ##### ☁️ New Azure Cosmos DB module  With the new Azure Comos DB module we finally added Azure to our list of cloud service testing facilities. It is based on Microsoft's [Azure Cosmos DB-Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21) and provides you with a way to do your integration testing without the need for an actual Azure service.  ```java public CosmosDBEmulatorContainer emulator = new CosmosDBEmulatorContainer(         DockerImageName.parse(""mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest"") ); ```  Please check out the [module docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/azure/) to learn how to use it for your integration testing needs.  ##### ⛴ Host port access for containers  For further improving the developer experience of our users, we added a new API to make hosts ports accessible to containers:      container.withAccessToHost(true)  You still need to use `exposeHostPorts`, [as per the docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/networking/#exposing-host-ports-to-the-container), but **this can now be done after the container has started**, thereby allowing new usage patterns in your tests.  ##### 🌪 Faster Cassandra startup  By making clever use of the configuration settings available in Cassandra, `CassandraContainer` will now start up to 3 times faster. It is now also configured to be less resource hungry out of the box.  ##### ✨ Better startup performance for all containers  We found a couple of ways to improve the container startup performance for our users, no matter the Testcontainers module you use. This comes through some internal changes with regards to how Testcontainers checks for open ports during container startup and will shave up to a couple of seconds from your test suite.  ***  We are grateful for the ongoing support of our community and users and thank each of our awesome contributors!  ##### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -

It's not perfect - not every image runs under QEMU. However, this allows Testcontainers users with M1 Macs to use more images than they could previously.  If possible, users should use recently published images for their dependencies which have a native ARM64 variant, rather than relying on QEMU emulation.  ##### Startup performance and reliability improvements  Some issues affecting container startup time and reliability (especially with Docker for Windows) have been fixed.  Additionally, this release uses the latest version of `docker-java` and uses an Apache HttpClient5 transport by default. This resolves bugs encountered by some users when the previous default transport (okhttp) relating to image pulling.  ***  As always, thank you to our many users and contributors!  ##### 🚀 Features & Enhancements  -

All of these APIs have been marked as deprecated and have been present in Mockito for quite a while.  An overview of now-deleted classes/methods:  -   `org.mockito.Matchers` which was an alias for     `org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers` -   `org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers#{anyObject,anyVararg}` both which were     aliases for `org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers#any` -   `org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers#any*Of`, which were aliases for the same     method name without the Of and the generic parameters (which were     ignored) -   `org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers#{is}{Not}Null(Class)` which took a class     which was ignored. Aliases for the same methods without the parameter -   `org.mockito.MockedStatic#verify` which had the parameter types reversed -   `org.mockito.Mockito#verifyZeroInteractions` an alias of     `verifyNoMoreInteractions` -   `org.mockito.Mockito#debug` framework integration API that we later     refactored -   `org.mockito.configuration.AnnotationEngine` which was leaking internal     APIs and instead users should use `org.mockito.plugins.AnnotationEngine` -   `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.TooLittleActualInvocations` fixed     the grammar from ""Little"" to ""Few"" -   Numerous internal APIs that we never officially supported and can now     remove -   `org.mockito.plugins.InstantiatorProvider` which was leaking internal     APIs and instead users should use InstantiatorProvider2 (we should     probably rename back to remove the number in a future major release) -   `org.mockito.runners` a package that hosted several old JUnit runners     which were no longer supported.

For example, you do not want to have a dash in the table, column, and sequence names. With the multiple objects check, you can specify a pattern to check for dashes and choose tables, columns, and sequences as the objects to check. In version 4.6.2, the check is available for:  -   Table -   Column -   Sequence  **Note:** For more information, see  [Multiple Objects Quality Check](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/community/quality-checks/multiple-objects.html)  \[DAT-8444]  ##### The logging of SQL statements and execution output  Liquibase  4.6.2 includes the  `liquibase.sql.logLevel`  configuration option to control the level at which SQL is logged. The default value is  `FINE`.  You can run the  `--sql-log-level`  parameter with the  `--log-level `  parameter in the CLI:  ```text liquibase --sql-log-level  --log-level= --log-file=log.txt update --changelog-file= ```  You can also set the parameter as follows:  -   `liquibase.sql.logLevel: `  in your  `liquibase.properties`  file -   `LIQUIBASE_SQL_LOG_LEVEL=`  as an environment variable \[[PR#​1520](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1520)] \[[nvoxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland)]  ##### An additional  `liquibase_libs`  directory  When you run Liquibase in the CLI, the executables generate a classpath with the  `.jar`  files from the  `LIQUIBASE_HOME`  and  `LIQUIBASE_HOME/lib`  directories. Liquibase 4.6.2 adds the ability to load an additional directory of  `liquibase_libs`  in the current working directory to the classpath.

This release fixes that issue.  ### [`v4.6.0`](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/v4.6.0)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/compare/v4.5.0...v4.6.0)  #### Liquibase 4.6.0 is a major release  Please report any issues to   #### Notable Changes  Starting with version 4.6.0, the Windows and Mac/Linux Liquibase installers and the .tar.gz and .zip installation files include the most common JDBC drivers in the installation package:  -   DB2 -   Firebird -   H2 -   HSQLDB -   PostgreSQL -   MariaDB -   MSSQL -   Oracle -   SQLite     To use the available drivers, see the [Adding and Updating Liquibase Drivers](https://docs.liquibase.com/workflows/liquibase-community/adding-and-updating-liquibase-drivers.html) documentation. Also, check the page for the cases when you need different drivers. \[[PR#​2031](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2031)] \[DAT-7438]     **Note:** Since Liquibase 4.6.0 provides driver jar files, the size of the installation package is bigger than the size of the installation package in earlier versions.  #### Liquibase Pro Changes  -   [Quality checks have configurable severity and exit codes](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/advanced/using-quality-checks-in-automation-severity-and-exit-code.html) \[DAT-8171] -   [The quality checks bulk-set command](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/pro/checks-bulk-set.html) \[DAT-8289] -   [New quality checks](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/advanced/configuring-quality-checks.html):     -   Static check: Warn when a table truncation is detected \[DAT-7933]     -   Dynamic check: Warn when granting specific privileges \[DAT-7972]     -   Static check: Warn when the `GRANT WITH ADMIN OPTION` statement is detected \[DAT-7955]     -   Static check: Warn when the `GRANT WITH GRANT OPTION` statement is detected \[DAT-7995] -   The `liquibase.checks-settings.conf` file is unencoded in version 4.6.0 and later versions for easier inspection that allows you to resolve a merge conflict in source control. Liquibase backs up encoded files in the working directory, and you can still use previous versions by specifying the `--checks-settings-file` parameter in the CLI, as an environment variable, or as a property in the liquibase.properties file. \[DAT-8473]     If you use Liquibase Hub, check the [Liquibase Hub DevOps metrics](https://docs.liquibase.com/tools-integrations/liquibase-hub/devops-metrics.html) documentation to learn more about DevOps metrics that provide the data to optimize your DevOps performance.  #### Enhancements  -   \[[PR#​1975](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1975)] \[[nvoxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland)] Changed the XSD default `errorOnMissingOrEmpty` attribute to `true` for the `includeAll` attribute in the XML *changelog* file.

The `diff` command reports a difference in unique constraints caused by the PostgreSQL database snapshot having fewer unique constraints than the snapshot from another database compared. Also, the issue can cause unreliable diffs and *changelog* generation for all non-MySQL databases. The fix will be available in the next release.

The latter is also true for JNA.     While the prefix is changed, the old prefix is still searched as a fallback     location, so if only a fat binary is present, it can still be loaded.    ---  ### Renovate configuration  :date: **Schedule**: ""before 2am"" (UTC).  :vertical_traffic_light: **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

  Added putIfAbsent optimistic fastpath ([#​506](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/506))  ### [`v3.0.0`](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/releases/v3.0.0)  [Compare Source](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/compare/v2.9.3...v3.0.0)  This release includes API incompatible changes.  ##### Highlights  -   **Java 11** or above is required -   Java 8 users can continue to use version 2.x, which will be supported  ##### API improvements  -   Added `Policy.refreshes()` for a snapshot of the in-flight refresh operations -   `CacheLoader` and `AsyncCacheLoader` offer `bulk` factory methods -   `AsyncCacheLoader` methods may now throw checked exceptions -   Better usage of Checker Framework nullness annotations ([#​337](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/337)) -   `LoadingCache.refresh` now returns the in-flight future ([#​143](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/143)) -   Various unimplemented default methods are now abstract -   Added `LoadingCache.refreshAll` convenience method -   Bulk loads now receive a `Set` of keys (was `Iterable`) -   More flexible generic bounds and type parameters  ##### Implementation improvements  -   Refresh operations ignore redundant calls during an in-flight load and are linearizable ([#​193](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/193), [#​236](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/236), [#​282](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/282), [#​322](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/322), [#​373](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/373), [#​467](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/467)) -   The [Java Platform Logging API](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/264) is used instead of `java.util.logging` ([#​456](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/456)) -   `sun.misc.Unsafe` is no longer required ([#​273](https://togithub.com/ben-manes/caffeine/issues/273))  ##### Incompatible changes  -   `VarExpiration` time-based puts now return the old value instead of a boolean result -   Removed jandex resource as no longer utilized by Quarkus -   Split `Policy.Expiration` into fixed and refresh interfaces  ##### Deprecation removals  -   `CacheWriter`, `SingleConsumerQueue`, and `UnsafeAccess` -   `StatsCounter.recordEviction` variations -   `CacheStats` constructors  ##### Notes  -   `CacheWriter` usages can be replaced by `Map` computations and `Caffeine.evictionListener` -   For best performance `Unsafe` may be used if available, otherwise falls back to `VarHandles` -   We will continue to support and maintain version 2.x for Java 8 users    ---  ### Configuration  📅 **Schedule**: ""before 2am"" (UTC).  🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

"","4007","Improved AdminServlet support","- Added new configuration structure to provide configuration options - Updated documentation  Resolves #3876  ###### Problem:  The `AdminServlet` has added configuration parameters (see [metrics issue](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1891)). There is no way to currently modify those values via Dropwizard configuration.  ###### Solution:  I added a new factory (following the factory patterns elsewhere in the `dropwizard-core` module) to create/configure the `AdminServlet`. The new factory encapsulates all of the configuration options for the servlet. The registration has also moved from `AbstractServerFactory` to the new servlet factory.  Updated documentation has been provided for the new configuration  ###### Result:  Dropwizard users can now turn off any or all of the servlets provided by the `AdminServlet`, or change their endpoint URIs. This is useful because the thread dump and profiling servlets can be used to consume application resources and block legitimate access to the application endpoints.  There should be no change for any user who does not use the new configuration settings; everything should continue to operate as before.","open","","mschechter-bellese","2021-05-27T18:36:11Z","2022-04-10T10:45:44Z"
"","4462","@UnitOfWork not always committing transaction after call","**Env Details** Dropwizard version: 2.0.25 Hibernate version: 5.5.8 DB: Postgres 9.6 and 13.4 on AWS RDS. Java version: 11 Postrgres JDBC driver version: 42.3.1  **Hibernate Entity definition** 	@Id 	@Column(name = ""id"", updatable = false, nullable = false) 	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) 	private Long id; 	....... 	@Override 	public boolean equals(Object o) { 		if (this == o) return true; 		if (o == null || Hibernate.getClass(this) != Hibernate.getClass(o)) return false; 		Issue issue = (Issue) o; 		return id != null && Objects.equals(id, issue.id); 	}  	@Override 	public int hashCode() { 		return getClass().hashCode(); 	} 	 **Details** I have an App that receives two sequential rest calls.  The first issues a single ""delete where xx = 'yy'"" on the entity definition above.  The second does processing and on-demand inserts to the same entity.  Since the entity has the @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) Hibernate issues an insert directly after the saveOrUpdate call.  The issue, however, is that the delete call sometimes gets issued to the db near the end of the second rest call.  This causes the recent inserts to be deleted.  It doesn't happen every time - which I think is down to how many sets of these calls are being done.  **Main Steps taken to try and resolve** 1. Tried different dropwizard version(initial version had Hibernate 5.5.2) and jdbc driver version.  No difference. 2. Added a flush after the executeUpdate statement.  No effect.  **Workaround found** If I manually manage the transaction and use @UnitOfWork(transactional = false) and manually call transaction.commit() the problem is fixed.

"","3580","Hibernate: DualSessionFactory","###### Problem: Modern RDBMS systems often provide read-replica clusters with separate access points. With regards to Hibernate, this requires two SessionFactory instances. One factory is for the primary/writer data source. And a separate factory is necessary for the read-replica data source. This requires the usage of the UnitOfWork name property whenever the read-replica is preferred. Ideally, no adjustments to the UnitOfWork properties should be necessary if the readOnly is properly set across endpoints.  ###### Solution: This commit provides a SessionFactory implementation that contains both a writer/primary factory and a reader factory. The DualSessionFactory comes with separate HibernateBundle, UnitOfWorkApplicationListener, and UnitOfWorkAspect classes. Prior to usage, the UnitOfWorkAspect class prepares the DualSessionFactory based on the UnitOfWork annotation readOnly property. When the dual HibernateBundle is dropped into an application, the UnitOfWork requires no changes across endpoints assuming that the readOnly property is already set accordingly.  ###### Result: This commit contains new DualSessionFactory, HibernateBundle, UnitOfWorkApplicationListener, and UnitOfWorkAspect classes.","closed","feature,","smalleyd2","2020-11-26T16:17:33Z","2022-04-05T15:04:45Z"

If you agree this is a good thing to do, there are other places where `failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown` is used and I'm happy to give those the same treatment if they look like suitable candidates.  Also, if these little cleanup PRs are annoying and creating unnecessary code churn and review effort, don't be afraid to say so.

Both are instanciated from static functions in `ConfigOverride`. This change would also allow application developers to build reusable grouped config overrides if needed.  Do you think this is a valid extension? I am happy to discuss the changes and do changes if needed.","closed","improvement,","dhenneke","2020-11-09T17:47:44Z","2020-11-26T16:36:37Z"

This can be done so long as the `Response` in the `WebApplicationException` doesn't have an entity, so I need to provide a custom `UnauthorizedHandler`. The only issue is that I cannot tell which exceptions are from the Dropwizard Auth package.  [Though to be fair, looking for 401 `UNAUTHORIZED` code is a reasonable workaround]  ###### Solution:  Ensure all exceptions thrown by the authentication package extend a specific type.   ###### Result:  I'm now able to build custom web pages correctly in my exception mapper.","closed","improvement,","msmerc","2021-08-31T16:35:42Z","2022-04-03T12:29:59Z"

"","4107","JsonConfigurationFactory is not used","### Background My goal is to use a TOML file, rather than YAML or JSON, to configure my Dropwizard service. While investigating how to do this, I found Weird Stuff...  ### Findings The first thing I tried was adding `jackson-dataformat-toml` to my project and feeding a .toml file to the `server` command, but that failed with a parse error. Then I started digging into how the configuration code works, and saw that there was a `YamlConfigurationFactory` and `JsonConfigurationFactory`, and it looked like adding a `TomlConfigurationFactory` would be straightforward. I tested the JSON support by feeding a .json file to the `server` command, and that worked. So I started looking for how one or the other was chosen, and I ended up in `DefaultConfigurationFactoryFactory`, which... is hard-coded to use `YamlConfigurationFactory`! That seemed odd, so I turned the debugger on and stepped through service startup, and sure enough when I use a .json config file it is being fed to `YamlConfigurationFactory`.  Some searching turned up this PR from several years ago https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/1897 which is the origin of `JsonConfigurationFactory`. I can see that tests were added to exercise both `YamlConfigurationFactory` and `JsonConfigurationFactory`, but no tests for which one is selected based on the input file. Neither the original bug thread nor the PR comments have any discussion of which implementation is selected or how. Since the motivation for that change was apparently ""the YAML parser doesn't suppor tabs in JSON"", I tried using a .json config file with tabs, and it fails.  Best as I can tell, the only way to cause any `ConfigurationFactory` implementation _other than_ `YamlConfigurationFactory` to be used is to write a custom `ConfigurationFactoryFactory` and set it on the `Boostrap` during startup (I tested this and it works). That's more or less fine, but it doesn't seem quite intentional? Also there's no way to write a `ConfigurationFactoryFactory` that detects the file type and chooses an appropriate factory, because the name/path of the config file is not part of its interface.  (all tests performed with `io.dropwizard:dropwizard-core:2.12.3`)   ### Questions 1. Is this design/behavior intentional? 2. If so, what is the purpose of including `JsonConfigurationFactory` with Dropwizard without any direct way of using it? (I'm classifying ""writing your own `ConfigurationFactoryFactory`"" as ""indirect""...) 3. Is there a way I'm not seeing to make a `ConfigurationFactoryFactory` implementation ""smart"" in terms of which `ConfigurationFactory` implementation it returns?","closed","stale,","slotrans","2021-07-05T18:31:22Z","2022-01-31T00:03:36Z"
