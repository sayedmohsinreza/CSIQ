"","3542","DualSessionFactory: feature request enhancement to the dropwizard-hibernate module","We've built an extension to the dropwizard-hiberbate module that manages both a writer SessionFactory and a reader SessionFactory within a single DualSessionFactory object. The DualSessionFactory piggybacks off the UnitOfWork annotation to determine which SessionFactory is used for each RESTful call. When ""readOnly=true"" is specified for a call, the reader SessionFactory will be substituted in place of the default/primary/writer SessionFactory.  To implement, we've extended the HibernateBundle and cloned with minor changes the UnitOfWorkApplicationListener & UnitOfWorkAspect classes. We've also add the DualSessionFactory class which implements the org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface by delegating to either the primary SessionFactory or the reader SessionFactory.  The integration of the DualSessionFactory has dramatically lowered our calls to the primary Aurora instance in favor of the read-replica cluster. That alone has breathed additional life into the scalability of transactional data source.  If you would like for us to proceed, please instruct us on the next steps.

When testing locally, we start our application from its all-in-one jar file and shut it down again after the tests, configuring metrics as local .csv files. However, we never see them :disappointed:  This is because dropwizard starts, we run tests and dropwizard stops again without ever getting the `report()` called from `ScheduledReporterManager` .  For us, it would be great if we could configure a `reportOnStop` setting to `true` that would cause one last `report()` when stopping.

The response is in JSON format.  The response header: ``` Content-Encoding →UTF-8 Content-Encoding →gzip ``` The actual content length is 532 bytes, but the response content-length shows 305 bytes.  Edit: This is happening only with a GET API. When I changed it to POST, content is completely displayed.","closed","","teenageorge","2019-02-20T00:34:42Z","2019-02-21T03:29:31Z"

You can mimic the failure by simply adding `@Session HttpSession session` to `HelloWorldResource` and re-running the test.

"","2597","Issue with UnitOfWork and WebTargets in UnitTests in Kotlin","We are currently trying our first dropwizard application in Kotlin. Everything works fine except the UnitOfWork annotation.  We have the following little endpoint that works perfectly fine if you call it with a simple ApiClient like Postman:  ```kotlin     @GET     @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)     @Timed     @UnitOfWork     fun getAttributes(@Auth user: User): CoreAttributes {         return CoreAttributes(userDao.getUser(user.id) ?: throw NotFoundException())     } ```  The problem here is userDAO.getUser(user.id). The DAO looks like this:  ```kotlin open class UserDAO @Inject constructor(sessionFactory: SessionFactory): AbstractDAO(sessionFactory) {      fun getUser(id: Long): UserData? {         return get(id)     } } ```  So in getUser(id: Long) the get method of the AbstractDAO in io.dropwizard.hibernate is called. That is basically this function:  ```java     protected E get(Serializable id) {         return (E) currentSession().get(entityClass, requireNonNull(id));     } ```      And the problem is that currentSession() throws org.hibernate.HibernateException: No session currently bound to execution context We call the endpoint like this in our unit tests:  ```kotlin     val webTarget: WebTarget = target(""the-endpoint-url"").request().get() ```      Calling the endpoint with an api client works. But calling the endpoint like this in our unit tests does not work. We did the same thing in our java services and in java it works perfectly fine.  Any ideas about that? I read something that Kotlin may have problems with reflaction operation in java frameworks or libraries but I'm not sure if reflection is the case here.

I have a PR that can fix this behavior by setting the client instance to null after it's closed, but what's happening still isn't what's described in the java doc.  Every time the after() method is called DropwizardTestSupport stops the application, and the subsequent call to before() will start a new instance of the application. You're better off just not using the extension and manually starting the app (I'm not sure if there are any negative effects  from not calling shutdown explicitly when tests complete, but there is a listener interface that could allow you to manually call after() if that's important).","closed","","tristanbuckner","2019-05-06T19:57:36Z","2019-05-15T10:40:09Z"

I think it would be more consistent to apply the **logFormat** to all layouts that derive from `PatternLayoutBase` and otherwise emit a warning if both options are set. That is, changing `AbstractAppenderFactory.buildLayout()` to something like  ```java         if (layout == null) {             layoutBase = defaultLayoutFactory.build(context, timeZone);         } else {             layoutBase = layout.build(context, timeZone);         }         if (!Strings.isNullOrEmpty(logFormat)) {             if (layoutBase instanceof PatternLayoutBase) {                 ((PatternLayoutBase)layoutBase).setPattern(logFormat);             } else {                 LOGGER.warn(""Ignoring 'logFormat', because 'layout' does not extend PatternLayoutBase"");             }         } ```  2) When setting a **logFormat** that includes time zone information (like the default `LogbackAccessRequestLayout`), the time zone is a fixed part of the string and may contradict the configured **timeZone** option. Maybe the **logFormat** could contain some kind of placeholder (e.g. ``) that gets automatically replaced with the correct value from the **timeZone** option?","closed","bug,","cleiner","2020-10-04T08:09:06Z","2020-11-02T08:53:49Z"

"","2880","Dropwizard BOM provides dependency management for modules outside the Dropwizard project","The BOM is setting dependency management for modules that aren't part of Dropwizard. This is not ideal, as it can cause conflicts when other projects import the BOM.  A simple example would be if I had a project using the Dropwizard BOM, and also depending on something that depends on `tomcat-jdbc:9.0.8` and `tomcat-dbcp:9.0.8`. In this case I would get `tomcat-jdbc:9.0.22` from Dropwizard, and `tomcat-dbcp:9.0.8`, which might not work together. This will happen even if I don't use a Dropwizard module that requires `tomcat-jdbc`.  See a similar discussion here https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/issues/1336  Ideally the BOM would only set the versions of io.dropwizard modules, and let the consuming project handle resolving any conflicts between transitive dependencies. This is also how several other modular projects do their BOMs (e.g. JUnit, Jackson, Camel)","closed","","srdo","2019-08-16T09:08:10Z","2019-09-16T15:40:16Z"

"","2663","Default useForwardedHeaders setting leaves applications vulnerable to X-Forwarded-For spoofing","The `useForwardedHeaders` setting in the [HTTP connector](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.9/docs/manual/configuration.html#man-configuration-http) is set to true by default. The documentation specifies that having this enabled will make Dropwizard honor `X-Forwarded-*` headers added by proxies (via the usage of Jetty's [ForwardedRequestCustomizer](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.java)), but it's not clear what is meant by ""look at"", ie, what actually is affected by this setting.  One of the undocumented implications of having this turned on is that if the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header is set on the incoming request, it actually changes the output of `ServletRequest::getRemoteHost`. The [servlet spec](https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getRemoteAddr--) for this method specifies that the output of that method should be the IP address of the client or the last proxy that sent the request (ie, the IP address of the remote peer in the TCP connection), making no reference to `X-Forwarded-For` or any other HTTP headers, so this is an unexpected change.  An implication of this is that anyone that can manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header can cause Dropwizard to use a spoofed value both for its internal logging and by providing this spoofed value via `ServletRequest::getRemoteHost`, potentially bypassing access control restrictions or auditing that an application might implement if it relies on this value.  With that setting on, any Dropwizard API that is exposed to the Internet would be vunerable to this type of remote IP address spoofing, unless all public facing load balancers that could potentially serve as reverse proxies to said application are actively performing sanitization of the `X-Forwarded-For` header (clearing it out fully instead of just appending its own IP address to an already existing header). With either no load balancers configured in that way or when exposed directly to the Internet, any Dropwizard application that relies on `getRemoteHost` can be tricked into using arbitrary data set by a malicious party instead of the client's remote IP address – this includes the access logs generated by Dropwizard.  Ideally, the default for this option should be `false`, to avoid undesired insecure behavior for situations where Dropwizard is not deployed behind a reverse proxy that is actively performing this sanitization. However, since that could potentially break existing applications, at the very least, documentation should be ammended to that the default setting of `true` will cause `ServletRequest::getRemoteHost` and Dropwizard's access logs to return the leftmost value in the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header and that sanitization of that header by a public-facing reverse proxy would be necessary if full accuracy in identifying the remote address of the client is required.  This is fairly easy to reproduce; on a sample 1.3.9 Dropwizard project, with the default configuration, with a single resource, sending a request while setting the `X-Forwarded-For` header to `dummy`, the following is logged in the access logs: ```dummy - - [26/Feb/2019:11:02:35 +0000] ""GET /test HTTP/1.1"" 200 19 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.119 Safari/537.36"" 78```  After setting `useForwardedHeaders` to false and repeating the same request: ```127.0.0.1 - - [26/Feb/2019:11:25:56 +0000] ""GET /test HTTP/1.1"" 200 18 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.119 Safari/537.36"" 86```","closed","security,","mpontes","2019-02-26T12:05:18Z","2019-04-28T18:42:49Z"

One example is Hawk tokens. They are created on the client using the URI you want to request and some shared secret. Then it is recreated on the server using the requested URI and the same secret and compared. However since the scheme is no longer in the request it default to `http://` and if the client requested a `https://` url we wont be able to match the token.","closed","","ljl","2020-01-29T15:32:30Z","2020-01-31T08:23:05Z"

"","3287","Optimization/Features/Suggestions around managed executors","Optimization/Features/Suggestions around managed executors 1. The current default thread factory creates a new DefaultThreadFactory instance whenever a new thread is constructed.   2. For threads we have a global counter. Would prefer a counter per executor service (Use a global pool and local thread number similar to DefaultThreadFactory). Can move threadFactory logic to its own class. Would've extended threadFactory but its a private static class. 3. nameFormat seems very unintuitive. It's not clear to users that they have to specify one. Also its usage across classes vary. (ScheduledExecutorServiceBuilder doesn't have that requirement). 4. People who aren't familiar with the ThreadPoolExecutor may run into issues like https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2553 when using the ExecutorServiceBuilder.    PR for point 1 - https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3285  For points 2, 3 and 4, I've created a draft PR and mentioned changes below. Don't think anything here can be considered as breaking changes. Can update release notes/docs/tests if you think this is a reasonable approach - https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3286  - User passes a prefix and the threadFactory will add pool/thread number.  - Whatever the user passes is what is used in the metric name. The methods getNameWithoutFormat in this https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3142 will return a string appended to itself, so it may have to be reverted. @pkwarren - Any feedback/concerns? - Includes managed and instrumented executor service factory methods. ThreadPoolExecutor Javadocs urges users to use the Executors factory methods that preconfigure settings for the most common usage scenarios. Also the InstrumentedExecutorService has additional metrics like idle/duration timers which InstrumentedThreadFactory (used in ExecutorServiceBuilder) doesn't have","closed","stale,","dennyac","2020-05-09T18:31:38Z","2021-06-07T00:08:22Z"

So the following fails:  ``` // Some service: class SomeService {   Stream stream() {     // Return JPA/Hibernate entities   } }  // The Resource @UnitOfWork Response someResource() {   Stream stream = someService.stream(...)     // Just a dummy operation, in reality this map is an expensive operation     .map(Entity::toString);    return Response.ok(new StreamingOutput() {     void write(out) {       // ... code to wrap out in bufferedwriter, etc ... //        stream.forEach(line -> {         out.write(line);       });      out.flush();     }   }).build(); } ```  The purpose of JAX-RS `StreamingOutput` is a pattern like the above, where instead of buffering the contents in the server memory we are delaying the expensive operation (the `Stream.map` here) and instead do it one by one as we write to the output stream. The above code doesn't work in Dropwizard because by the time `StreamingOutput` is executing the `@UnitOfWork` is closed.  I believe the fix should be simple, in `UnitOfWorkApplicationListener` we would move the call `unitOfWorkAspect.afterEnd()` from `RequestEvent.Type.RESP_FILTERS_START` to `RequestEvent.Type.FINISHED` instead.

Is there a way to make this work, where i can setup and pass the mocked instance of `DemoConfiguration` to the constructor of `DemoResource`? The alternative would be to create an instance of every single one of those Configuration (and other deps) passed into the constructor manually which would be impossible given the no. of properties.  I've tried moving the `ResourceTestRule` into `@Before` step but that doesn't work either.

"","2930","Hibernate seems to be bootstrapped twice","I've been debugging the slow Dropwizard bootstrap times and I've noticed something suspicious. The bootstrap of the Hibernate from `dropwizard-hibernate` seems to happen twice causing noticeable amount of slowdown (30-50ms in the real project), because the `BootstrapServiceRegistry` is instantiated and configured twice.  This can be observed by putting breakpoint inside the constructor of `IntegratorServiceImpl` class from Hibernate and then bootstrapping `dropwizard` with `HibernateBundle`. The first instance comes from [instantiating `Configuration`](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-hibernate/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/hibernate/SessionFactoryFactory.java#L72) and second one from [instantiating `StandardServiceRegistryBuilder`](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-hibernate/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/hibernate/SessionFactoryFactory.java#L89) just below. According to the JavaDoc from the Hibernate's `Configuration` class internally it uses newer bootstrap approach (which as I understand is `StandardServiceRegistryBuilder`). So it kinda doesn't make sense to use both at the same time.  It seems that the fix may require some breaking changes to the public API to fix this problem. I'll try to take a stub at it later today.","closed","improvement,","devoto13","2019-09-17T07:40:30Z","2019-10-12T21:31:46Z"

I've also changed my code to call `getAsLong()` now that the parameter type no longer has a `get()` method.  Here's the code following updating to dropwizard 2.   ``` 	@ExceptionMetered 	@GET 	@Path(""/search"") 	@Timed 	@ApiOperation( 			value=""search"", 			tags=""Search"", 			notes=""Searches all records"") 	@ApiResponses(value = 			{ @ApiResponse(code = 400, message = ""'fromId' parameter is mandatory"") }) 	public ResultPage search( 			@Auth final ServiceUser user, 			@QueryParam(""fromId"") @DefaultValue(""0"") final OptionalLong fromId, 			@QueryParam(""department"") final Set departments, 			@QueryParam(""area"") final Set areas) {  		final Long idFrom = fromId.getAsLong(); 		final List records = tenancyDao.execute(idFrom, departments, areas);  		return new ResultPageFactory(pageLimit).build(records); 	} ```  However now my `DefaultValue` annotation on the parameter no longer seems to be getting set when no value is passed to the parameter. This causes the exception from `fromId.getAsLong()` but I would expect it to always have a value due to the default value: ``` ! java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present ! at java.util.OptionalLong.getAsLong(OptionalLong.java:118) ```  Debugging through has led me to [this line in `SingleValueExtractor`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/blob/2.29.1/core-server/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/server/internal/inject/SingleValueExtractor.java#L61): ``` return fromString((value == null && isDefaultValueRegistered()) ? getDefaultValueString() : value); ```  At this point `value` is `""""` (empty string) so although `isDefaultValueRegistered()` is `true`, it uses `value` instead of the default value.   **What do I need to do to get it to use the default value when none is set, as it did with dropwizard 1.3.x?**  Note before I updated my code to use `OptionalLong` I was getting `java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: """"` from [this line in `AbstractParam`](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/release/2.0.x/dropwizard-jersey/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jersey/params/AbstractParam.java#L35) when the `LongParam` constructor was called, but the cause was the same: my param had a value of empty string instead of the default.","closed","bug,","chris-orchard","2020-01-30T13:31:06Z","2020-02-22T00:04:43Z"
"","3335","2.X.X deprecates UUIDParam, SizeParam, LocalDateParam, InstantParam, DurationParam, DateTimeParam, BooleanParam and does not give clear alternatives","I'm trying to upgrade Dropwizard from 1.3.23 to 2.0.10 and am running into some issues around the use of parameters. Specifically, I see that [this commit](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/commit/69f6e77a19778aeb9a0c5bab897c5e8363ca1dbb) deprecated a number of *Param classes.  Some of these, like `IntParam` are straightfoward. Using `OptionalInt` as a replacement makes sense. However, taking non-primitive parameters as an example, `Optional` is NOT a sufficient replacement for `UUIDParam`. Using it results in me getting a 404 when using a non-UUID as input (where I previously got 400 using UUIDParam).  Additionally, and maybe this is a separate issue, I found the compatibility-preserving use of UUIDParam is strange. When diving into the source code, I found this resource method[[1]]:  ```         @GET         @Path(""/uuid"")         public String getUUID(@QueryParam(""uuid"") Optional uuid) {             return uuid.orElse(new UUIDParam(""d5672fa8-326b-40f6-bf71-d9dacf44bcdc"")).get().toString();         } ```  This construct seems an extremely clunky way to manage this. In 1.3.X, I could write code like this instead:  ```         @GET         @Path(""/uuid"")         public String getUUID(@Nullable @QueryParam(""uuid"") UUIDParam uuid) {             if (uuid != null) {                 return uuid.get()             } else {                 return ""d5672fa8-326b-40f6-bf71-d9dacf44bcdc""             }         } ```  You can see in the above that there is a lot of unnecessary conversion going on (we construct a UUID via UUIDParam and validate it, even though we just want to return a String). I use Kotlin primarily, my preferred example above would be even simpler:  ``` uuid.get()?.toString ?: ""d5672fa8-326b-40f6-bf71-d9dacf44bcdc"" ``` What I'd prefer overall is something that worked like this:  ```         @GET         @Path(""/uuid"")         public String getUUID(@Nullable @QueryParam(""uuid"") Optional uuid) {             return uuid.map { it.toString() }.orElse(""d5672fa8-326b-40f6-bf71-d9dacf44bcdc"")         } ```  More than anything, really, I just want some guidance for the right way to handle various param types, especially in light of the deprecation. The documentation is light on this (I found the MR saying AbstractParam and child classes will be removed, but nothing saying why, and no code showing what would replace the more complicated use-cases like UUIDParam above). I would love to see this improved. Until then, I'm hesitant to upgrade to 2.X.X. Param handling is still confusing in 1.X.X, but at least I won't have to worry about behavior changes.

In logback-classic, the user can configure the async appender in XML, so I don't have to do anything special there.  In Dropwizard 1.3, all appenders seem to be async, but the AsyncAppenderFactory doesn't inherit from Discoverable and doesn't appear to be injectable via configuration. In order to use my AsyncAppender, I have to derive from each individual AppenderFactory and override `wrapAsync` to use my AppenderFactory.  I would like to open a PR that would: 1. Make AsyncAppenderFactory inherit from Discoverable 2. Add a configuration parameter under logging that would support setting this (similar to LayoutFactory and AppenderFactory instances today). 3. Use AsyncLoggingEventAppenderFactory by default if not configured  I'm open to: 1. Being wrong; I may have missed something reading the code. 1. Other ways of implementing this; Discoverable seems to be the consistent pattern 2. The name and placement of the config parameter in logging 3. Whether or not this would apply to the request logs (my default is no, since request logs are typically very specific and rarely customized as much). 4.

In looking at the releases history, it looks like 1.3.27 was released after 2.0 came out, which was great to see.

I'm currently trying to get this working with DW, Junit5 and gradle and not having much luck.  I keep getting new DW containers for each integration test.  It is desirable to have one DW container for multiple integration tests because of test performance.  Spinning up a container for every test is expensive.  In my case state is not important because all requests are idempotent.  Also, it's best to leave that decision up to each developer.  If clearing state is important then they developer should spin up a new container.  Also, when my app starts up it creates a resource at a known location using a Managed Object.  When the managed object stops the resource is torn down.  If I have 3 concurrent integration tests running, the resource from one test will get torn down before the others have finished.  This causes the other tests to fail.  My app is designed to run as one container, so testing it as multiple containers isn't really testing the real behavior.  Additionally, the resource is expense so my app checks to see if it exists before creating it.  The prevents it from being created if it already exists which might happen if the the tear down fails.    The DropwizardAppRule behavior was great, please bring it back.","closed","stale,","donahchoo","2020-01-26T03:11:37Z","2020-05-10T00:03:48Z"

Please suggest if I'm missing something here.","closed","","ayaz-pasha","2018-12-26T11:58:59Z","2018-12-26T12:02:21Z"

To still show the annotation in use I have modified the ```Person``` class in core and the people resource to reflect that. I have also added a test to show the validation in action on the resource.  ###### Result: I know adding age to a person isn't a particularly sensible thing  to do normally, but it is a good way to show basic use of these annotations in action. Feedback on the test would also be appreciated, without an exception mapper I'm not sure what to test for - other than what I have implemented.","closed","","HarryEH","2019-12-25T00:23:38Z","2020-01-05T13:42:45Z"

And this lead to setting up the chain of HTTP connector. If client does not want to use server command, this would result bringing up an HTTP server without actually using it.  I would suggest that we should lazy create this object when we needed to use it.  For example, if client want to create **simple** instead of **default**.

But this line is passing the format itself instead of a name.   JerseyClientBuilder (line 177) passes the format 'jersey-client-[NAME]-%d' to LifecycleEnvironment, which passes that format to this class as part of constructor. This class then takes the format, but does no formatting using it, rather just passes it wrongfully to ExecutorServiceManager.  Not sure what's the intent of that '%d' is. So can't really provide a pull request for it. Someone familiar with these code need to fix it.  Effect of this is, metric is getting generated with that %d in the name.  Same is occurring with TimeBoundHealthCheck pool also. I haven't yet traced the code responsible for it. It'll be nice to get that fixed too.","closed","","inrix-adasgupta","2020-02-10T23:22:05Z","2020-03-21T23:02:17Z"

"","2571","Connection hangs in a DropwizardAppRule test","Hello. I somehow managed to create a test that hangs indefinitely. It's a DropwizardAppRule test, and the dropwizard app talks to a running WireMock server as well. After a certain point, the test hangs when trying to make a request to the WireMock server. I am rather convinced the problem isn't to do with WireMock as I've managed to get it to pass by initialising a JerseyClient on every call to the WireMock server. I've spent two days trying to figure out the issue with no success. Bizarrely, there are many other tests in the project that use WireMock and DropwizardAppRule and I'm not sure why this is happening only for this test.   This connection hanging behaviour is deterministic (at least on my machine).  This is the test: https://github.com/alphagov/pay-connector/blob/connection-hanged/src/test/java/uk/gov/pay/connector/it/resources/stripe/StripeResourceITest.java  More details on what I've done here: https://github.com/alphagov/pay-connector/commit/04e9008951c77b8717dae050b0211d1a6531ad05.  My branch is here: https://github.com/alphagov/pay-connector/tree/connection-hanged.  I realise this might be a jetty problem. If so, let me know and I'll raise an issue there. Thanks.","closed","","oswaldquek","2018-11-28T09:45:34Z","2019-01-18T09:59:18Z"
"","3221","Unable to setup Junit5 testing with dropwizard 2.0.0","Hello,  I have been trying to work with extensions to integrate Junit5 test cases into my application. According to the documentation, my understanding is that the extension should be able to spin up a temp server depending on which extension you use. I have tried DropwizardAppExtension, ResourceExtension and DropwizardClientExtension. I am getting a null pointer for the extension in each of the cases and unable to initialize a client to test my resources. Pasting below code for ref.   ```java @ExtendWith(DropwizardExtensionsSupport.class) public class SessionResourceTest {  //    @ClassRule //    public static final ResourceTestRule resources = ResourceTestRule.builder() //            .addResource(new SessionResource((mock(SessionService.class)))) //            .build();  //    @ClassRule //    public static final DropwizardAppRule RULE = //            new DropwizardAppRule(CustomerRepositoryApplication.class, ResourceHelpers.resourceFilePath(""config-local.yaml""));   //    private static final DropwizardClientExtension dropwizard = new DropwizardClientExtension(new SessionResource(mock(SessionService.class)));      private static final ResourceExtension RULE = ResourceExtension.builder().addResource(new SessionResource(mock(SessionService.class))).build();  //    public final DropwizardAppExtension EXTENSION = //            new DropwizardAppExtension(CustomerRepositoryApplication.class, resourceFilePath(""config-local.yml""));  //    ResourceExtension resources = ResourceExtension.builder() //            .addResource(new SessionResource((mock(SessionService.class)))) //            .build();      private final SessionRequest sessionRequest = new SessionRequest(""web"", ""newtest"");      private static final ObjectMapper MAPPER = Jackson.newObjectMapper();      @BeforeEach     public void setup() {         // Do any mock data prep here.     }      @AfterEach     public void tearDown() {         // we have to reset the mock after each test         reset();     }      @Test     public void testCreate() throws Exception {         final Entity entity = Entity.entity(sessionRequest, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE);  //        assertThat(response.getStatus(), is(200)); //        dropwizard.baseUri();  //        appExtension.getLocalPort();          final Response response = RULE.target(""/session/create"").request().post(entity);         assertThat(response).isInstanceOf(Session.class);          final Session session = response.readEntity(Session.class);         assertThat(session.getSessionId()).isNotBlank();     } } ```  I have added my commented code as well, just to show what all I have tried till now. I am new to dropwizard testing and would appreciate any sort of help I can get.   Also, using the earlier Junit4 setup, I was able to get a server up and running but faced issues with dependency injection. After mocking my dependencies, I faced issues with HttpServletRequest as there was no constructor available to create that object.","closed","","shubhangseth","2020-03-30T07:59:12Z","2022-02-19T11:27:55Z"
"","3192","Using UnitOfWork with UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory when creating json on the resource does not work anymore","Hello,  In version 1.3.12 of Dropwizard we used a class that is created with UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory. The return of one of our resources had a variable that is an instance of this class and that during the creation of the response in JSON saved some data in the database via hibernate.  We are migrating to Dropwizard 2.0.2 and we had a problem with that, UnitOfWork tries to use the same transaction as the resource due to the new code implemented and therefore throws the error due to the code      if (unitOfWork.transactional ()! = (txn! = null && txn.isActive ())) {         throw new IllegalStateException (String.format (             ""Existing session transaction state (% s) does not match requested (% b)"",             txn == null? ""NULL"": Boolean.valueOf (txn.isActive ()),             unitOfWork.transactional ()         ));     } Because the resource transaction is no longer active and we have the response ""Unable to create json"". This worked perfectly in version 1.3.12  I saw that this new code was created at https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/2913  How should I act in such a case? Is it a bug in the new version? We are doing something wrong?","closed","bug,","irineuruiz","2020-03-12T20:36:40Z","2020-10-20T06:09:05Z"

In the previous version of Dropwizard jdbi, I was able to override the database timezone when creating a new DBIFactory like this:  `    DBIFactory createDBIFactory()     {         return new DBIFactory() {             @Override             protected Optional databaseTimeZone() {                 return Optional.of(TimeZone.getTimeZone(""UTC""));             }         };     } `  Which passed in a timezone to the InstantArgumentFactory to handle InstantArguments to a specify a timezone conversion.  With this I was able to have my JVM set to one timezone, but my database entries were submit as another (UTC). I was doing some testing with my current changes to use the new JDBI factory: `JdbiFactory createJdbiFactory()     {         return new JdbiFactory();     }` and I noticed Instant() timestamps were incorrect, which lead me to this issue.  Is there a new implementation or method that can be used to achieve this same result?  Thanks!","closed","","Tylerremmie","2020-09-30T16:42:06Z","2022-02-19T11:28:22Z"

"","2599","Fallback to default Jackson enum handling when DeserializationFeature…","Fallback to default Jackson enum handling when DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL or DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE is enabled.  ###### Problem: Dropwizard's default ObjectMapper comes with a custom enum deserializer ""FuzzyEnumModule"". This deserializer does not handle DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL, which causes unknown enums to throw an exception even when DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL is enabled.  ###### Solution: Updated the FuzzyEnumModule#findEnumDeserializer() method so that it returns null (and therefore falls back to the standard Jackson enum deserializer) when DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL is enabled.  Also added DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE to the condition so that the same behaviour applies when DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE is enabled (I know this would fall back to Jackson regardless due to the presence of @JsonEnumDefaultValue on the enum, however this addition short circuits the need to check every enum value for a Jackson annotation when the feature is enabled on the ObjectMapper).  ###### Result: When DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL is enabled the deserialzation of unknown enums does not throw an exception but instead deserialzes the value as 'null'. The is expected Jackson behavior when enabling DeserializationFeature.READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL.","closed","bug,","boatmisser","2019-01-16T19:10:18Z","2019-01-20T17:46:42Z"

"","3094","Potential memory leak","Dropwizard version: 1.3.17 JDK version: 11  We have a REST API built on top of Dropwizard. This API is used by two websites and there are around 5000 active users (not concurrent). Since we started getting more users, we also started to have memory problems on our servers. We have two API servers, each have 1 GB of RAM and their only purpose is to run the API. CPU usage is extremely low, the only issue we have is with memory.  When we start the service, the server used memory is around 500 MB. Then, slowly, the used memory increases to over 900 MB and our user start having problem logging in. Since this is a REST API, we aren't keeping any data so my assumption is that the memory usage should remain stable.  Here is a snapshot of the memory on December 12: ```  num     #instances         #bytes  class name (module) -------------------------------------------------------    1:         94232        8849440  [B (java.base@11.0.4)    2:         83376        2001024  java.lang.String (java.base@11.0.4)    3:         11925        1409680  java.lang.Class (java.base@11.0.4)    4:         39832        1274624  com.codahale.metrics.WeightedSnapshot$WeightedSample    5:          9254        1172952  [I (java.base@11.0.4)    6:           862        1013584  [C (java.base@11.0.4)    7:         31533        1009056  java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap$Node (java.base@11.0.4)    8:         11279         992552  java.lang.reflect.Method (java.base@11.0.4)    9:         40068         961632  java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap$Node (java.base@11.0.4) ```  Here is another snapshot for the same server on January 5: ```  num     #instances         #bytes  class name (module) -------------------------------------------------------    1:         13377       19390000  [I (java.base@11.0.4)    2:        107254       10724240  [B (java.base@11.0.4)    3:         76634        2452288  com.codahale.metrics.WeightedSnapshot$WeightedSample    4:         95478        2291472  java.lang.String (java.base@11.0.4)    5:         76927        1846248  java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap$Node (java.base@11.0.4)    6:         76636        1839264  java.lang.Double (java.base@11.0.4)    7:         12236        1444728  java.lang.Class (java.base@11.0.4)    8:           875        1296120  [C (java.base@11.0.4)    9:         11573        1018424  java.lang.reflect.Method (java.base@11.0.4) ```  The only thing I can see in there is that `WeightedSnapshot` keeps getting bigger over time.

Additionally, using an invalid value for a `@DefaultValue` parameter used to fail fast when the Jersey resource was added. This changed with more lax parsing in DropWizard 2.x.  Update to preserve the previous behavior of empty string parameter values and invalid `@DefaultValue` values. This should avoid issues with adoption of DropWizard 2.x.

EXPLANATION The snakeyaml package is vulnerable to YAML Entity Expansion. The load method in Yaml.class allows for entities to reference other entities. An attacker could potentially exploit this behavior by providing a YAML document with many entities that reference each other, which could take a large amount of memory to process, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation.  DETECTION The application is vulnerable by using this component with untrusted user input when the maxAliasesForCollections is set too high or settings.setAllowRecursiveKeys is set to false.  RECOMMENDATION We recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.  Note: If this component is included as a bundled/transitive dependency of another component, there may not be an upgrade path. In this instance, we recommend contacting the maintainers who included the vulnerable package. Alternatively, we recommend investigating alternative components or a potential mitigating control.

For that reason, there is a method call `InjectionManager.completeRegistration`, which is called  (https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/blob/master/core-server/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/server/ApplicationHandler.java#L347) only after  Jersey Features are configured (https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/blob/master/core-server/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/server/ApplicationHandler.java#L328)  So If CDI or HK2 (with `DELAYED` strategy) InjectionManagers are used, an application will throw an error during initialization.  You can test it yourself by adding this to your `pom.xml`:  ```     org.glassfish.jersey.inject    jersey-cdi2-se    2.30  ```  Exception stacktrace: ``` java.lang.NullPointerException 	at io.dropwizard.validation.InjectValidatorFeature.configure(InjectValidatorFeature.java:33) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.model.internal.CommonConfig.configureFeatures(CommonConfig.java:702) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.model.internal.CommonConfig.configureMetaProviders(CommonConfig.java:627) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ResourceConfig.configureMetaProviders(ResourceConfig.java:823) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler.initialize(ApplicationHandler.java:328) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler.lambda$initialize$1(ApplicationHandler.java:293) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:292) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:274) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.processWithException(Errors.java:232) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler.initialize(ApplicationHandler.java:292) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler.(ApplicationHandler.java:259) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.WebComponent.(WebComponent.java:311) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer.init(ServletContainer.java:154) 	at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer.init(ServletContainer.java:347) 	at javax.servlet.GenericServlet.init(GenericServlet.java:203) 	at org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder.initServlet(ServletHolder.java:594) ```","closed","stale,","t3hk0d3","2020-04-02T18:45:22Z","2020-08-17T17:45:39Z"

Release notes Sourced from liquibase-core's releases.  v3.8.7 Liquibase 3.8.7 Overview Liquibase 3.8.7 Extends Targeted Rollbacks Capabilities for Liquibase Pro We are excited to announce with the release of Liquibase 3.8.7, Liquibase Pro users now have additional targeted rollback capabilities with two brand new commands! The creation of the rollbackOneUpdate command allows users to rollback their last update, or target any previous update with a --deploymentId parameter, and our new rollbackOneUpdateSQL command allows you view the SQL your rollbackOneUpdate command would produce prior to deploying it. That way, you can ensure you don't encounter any unintended consequences before rolling back. Each one of these commands come with their own --help to give you friendly command-specific assistance when you need it most. Just type liquibase rollbackOneUpdate --help or liquibase rollbackOneUpdateSQL --help to find what you need. To also help you navigate the Targeted Rollback waters, our fantastic engineers have created a brand new command available to both Liquibase Community and Pro users, we call this command history. The history command lists out all of your deploymentIds and all changeSets associated with each deploymentId so you can inspect a group of changes to ensure they have been applied to the database. Just type liquibase history into your command line to see it in action. Don't forget, you can also use a --outputFile parameter to write this information to a text file! Bug Fixes Liquibase 3.8.7 also continues our initiative to make Liquibase bigger, badder, and even better than before.

These installers include everything you need to run Liquibase (including Java) to make getting started easier than ever. GETTING_STARTED.txt Regardless of how you install Liquibase, there is now a GETTING_STARTED.txt file that points you to some sample projects to start trying Liquibase as quickly as possible. Targeted Rollbacks for Liquibase Pro with 'rollbackOneChangeset' command You asked, and we listened! With the release of Liquibase 3.8.6, Liquibase Pro users will now have additional rollback capabilities with Targeted Rollback, a powerful new feature that allows you to target one changeSet to rollback, without affecting all the other changeSets which followed it. Think ""git cherry pick"" for rollbacks. We even added a helper command ""rollbackOneChangsetSQL"", which will show you the SQL that will be used in the rollbackOneChangeset command. You can now also receive command specific help for Targeted Rollback by typing in either liquibase rollbackOneChangeSet --help or liquibase rollbackOneChangeSetSql --help.

Release notes Sourced from jacoco-maven-plugin's releases.  0.8.6 New Features  JaCoCo now officially supports Java 14. Experimental support for Java 15 class files (GitHub #992). Experimental support for Java 16 class files (GitHub #1059). Methods toString, hashCode and equals generated by compiler for records are filtered out during generation of report (GitHub #990). Bridge methods are filtered out during generation of report (GitHub #1010). Methods generated by Kotlin compiler for non-overridden non-abstract methods of interfaces are filtered out during generation of report (GitHub #1012). Branches added by the Kotlin compiler version 1.3.60 for suspending functions with tail call optimization are filtered out during generation of report (GitHub #1016).  Fixed bugs  Compression method of zip entries is now preserved when instrumenting archives. This allows to use JaCoCo with frameworks that expect uncompressed entries (GitHub #1018).  Non-functional Changes  Support for Pack200 was removed in JDK 14. JaCoCo will now throw a detailed exception when Pack200 archives are processed with the latest JDKs (GitHub #984). JaCoCo now depends on ASM 8.0.1 (GitHub #1032, #1043).  API Changes  URLStreamHandlerRuntime removed (GitHub #471).

Changelog Sourced from checker-qual's changelog.  Version 3.7.0, October 1, 2020 The new Called Methods Checker tracks methods that have definitely been called on an object. It automatically supports detecting mis-uses of the builder pattern in code that uses Lombok or AutoValue. Accumulation analysis is now supported via a generic Accumulation Checker. An accumulation analysis is a restricted form of typestate analysis that does not require a precise alias analysis for soundness. The Called Methods Checker is an accumulation analysis. The Nullness Checker supports annotations org.codehaus.commons.nullanalysis.NotNull, org.codehaus.commons.nullanalysis.Nullable, and org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable. The Signature Checker supports annotations @CanonicalName and @CanonicalNameOrEmpty. The Signature Checker treats jdk.jfr.Unsigned as an alias for its own @Unsigned annotation.

Changelog Sourced from bcprov-jdk15on's changelog.    <title>Bouncy Castle Crypto Package - Release Notes</title>    Bouncy Castle Crypto Package - Release Notes      1.0 Introduction  The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of  cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it  contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment (including the J2ME) with the additional infrastructure to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.  2.0 Release History 2.1.1 Version Release: 1.65 Date:      2020, March 31st. 2.1.2 Defects Fixed  DLExternal would encode using DER encoding for tagged SETs. This has been fixed. ChaCha20Poly1305 could fail for large (>~2GB) files. This has been fixed. ChaCha20Poly1305 could fail for small updates when used via the provider. This has been fixed. Properties.getPropertyValue could ignore system property when other local overrides set. This has been fixed. The entropy gathering thread was not running in daemon mode, meaning there could be a delay in an application shutting down due to it. This has been fixed. A recent change in Java 11 could cause an exception with the BC Provider's implementation of PSS. This has been fixed. BCJSSE: TrustManager now tolerates having no trusted certificates. BCJSSE: Choice of credentials and signing algorithm now respect the peer's signature_algorithms extension properly. BCJSSE: KeyManager for KeyStoreBuilderParameters no longer leaks memory.  2.1.3 Additional Features and Functionality  LMS and HSS (RFC 8554) support has been added to the low level library and the PQC provider. BCJSSE: BC API now supports explicitly specifying the session to resume. BCJSSE: Ed25519, Ed448 are now supported when TLS 1.2 or higher is negotiated (except in FIPS mode). BCJSSE: Added support for extended_master_secret system properties: jdk.tls.allowLegacyMasterSecret, jdk.tls.allowLegacyResumption, jdk.tls.useExtendedMasterSecret . BCJSSE: Ed25519, Ed448 are now supported when TLS 1.2 or higher is negotiated (except in FIPS mode). BCJSSE: KeyManager and TrustManager now check algorithm constraints for keys and certificate chains. BCJSSE: KeyManager selection of server credentials now prefers matching SNI hostname (if any). BCJSSE: KeyManager may now fallback to imperfect credentials (expired, SNI mismatch). BCJSSE: Client-side OCSP stapling support (beta version: via status_request extension only, provides jdk.tls.client.enableStatusRequestExtension, and requires CertPathBuilder support).  ...

"","3373","Don't specify scope in dependencyManagement of BOM","`` is commonly used for locking down the version of a dependency, not its scope. Doing that breaks the scope of transitive dependencies and is very hard to troubleshoot.  ###### Problem:  I've a dependency in my project:  ```      org.keycloak     keycloak-core     ${keycloak.version}  ```  `keycloak-core`'s `pom.xml` has the following `compile` dependency:  ```      org.bouncycastle     bcprov-jdk15on     ${bouncycastle.version}  ```  With `dropwizard-dependencies` BOM in my project, here is how `keycloak-core` looks like in the output of maven dependency tree:  ``` [INFO] +- org.keycloak:keycloak-core:jar:8.0.2:compile [INFO] | +- org.keycloak:keycloak-common:jar:8.0.2:compile [INFO] | \- org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:jar:1.65.01:test ``` (edited for brevity)  The problem is in the last line, the bouncy castle dependency got its scope changed to `test`, because `dropwizard-dependency`'s `` section specifies a `` for the bouncy castle artifact which takes precedence and converts all transitive dependencies on that artifact to the `test` scope. I believe the intention here was to lock down transitive dependencies versions not scopes. The scope is always specified alongside the `` declaration in the actual `` anyway.  ###### Solution:  Remove `` declaration from ``.   ###### Result:  Avoid surprises during builds.

"","2741","Allow response content type to be specified for a Task","###### Problem: I sometimes want to return data in JSON format in the response from a Task, and it's inconvenient that the response content type is hardcoded as `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`, because some client libraries expect JSON with an `application/json` content type and it means I have to do an extra translation step.  It would be really helpful if, when implementing actions, I had the option of specifying the response type to override the default `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`.  ###### Solution: I added an Optional responseContentType field to Task.   I kept the existing constructor the same, and added a new one where you can pass a `String contentResponseType`. If the original constructor is used, or if `null` is passed as `contentResponseType` in the new one, then the `contentResponseType` field will be empty.  I added a corresponding constructor to `PostBodyTask` as well, to specify `contentResponseType` - it just passes it through to the super Task.  In `TaskServlet`, I just check if a `contentResponseType` exists for the Task, and set that as the response content type if so, and use the default `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` if not.  Also added tests for both cases - when the response content type is specified, and when it's not and defaults to `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`.  ###### Result: The existing API and behaviour for Tasks remains the same, but you now have the option of specifying a custom response content type for your own custom Tasks, if you need.","closed","improvement,","davnicwil","2019-04-22T13:33:27Z","2019-07-20T12:34:42Z"

People who aren't familiar with the ThreadPoolExecutor may run into issues like https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2553 when using the ExecutorServiceBuilder.   ###### Solution: 1. Use logic used in DefaultThreadFactory with the ability to name threads 2. Avoid nameFormat since the NamedThreadFactory deals with this 3.

This only affects dropwizard users who use the external or classic request loggers.  Additionally, I needed to update a keystore / truststore in the tls tcp logger test. No idea why this was necessary, but I spent several hours trying to debug ""unknown certificate: localhost"" that only occurred when using jetty v9.4.15.

This comes up if you have a `Principal` that has different permissions or roles depending on the object it's accessing, for example:   A user can access its `Company`, can create a `Case`, but cannot read somebody else `Case`: ```java @RolesAllowed({""read"", ""write""}) @GET public Case getPlan(@Auth User user, @PathParam(""company"") String company, @PathParam(""case"") String case) {     return dao.findCase(user, company, case); }  @RolesAllowed({""write""}) @POST public Case getPlan(@Auth User user, @PathParam(""company"") String company) {     return dao.createCase(user, company); } ```  There is currently no real way to authorize this kind of logic using the existing`Authorizer`, since it only aware of `User`/`Principal`.  I've seen a few mention of this problem on the mailing list and it's also related to issue #2534.  ###### Solution:  This pass the `UriInfo` from each request to `Authorizer.authorize`, so that you can access path or query parameters to decide if a request is authorized or not. The new signature default to calling `authorize(User principal, String role)`, so it should be backward compatible.  But otherwise the change would look like this:  ```java public class Authorizer implements Authorizer {     @Override     public boolean authorize(User principal, String role) {         return authorize(principal, role, null);     }      @Override     public boolean authorize(User principal, String role, UriInfo uriInfo) {         return uriInfo.getUriInfo().getPathParameters().getFirst(""company"").equals(""dropwizard"");     } } ```  It does seems strange that I would be the first one to encounter this use case, with both dropwizard and/or Jersey.

They will only incorporate the time it took to construct the future object and return, not the time the resource actually took to run and create a response.  The `InstrumentedResourceMethodApplicationListener` actually supports a flag, `trackFilters`, that listens to the correct Jersey events in order to measure the total time for the resource logic to complete, rather than just for the resource method to return. However, there's no way to configure Dropwizard so that this functionality is enabled.  ###### Solution:  This is a one-line change that enables `trackFilters`. For every `@Timed` annotation, there would be additional metrics. In this case, in addition to `com.mypackage.MyResource.myResourceMethod`, there would also be `...myResourceMethod.request.filtering`, `...myResourceMethod.response.filtering`, and `...myResourceMethod.total`. The latter of which could be used to determine the actual execution time.  ###### Result:  All `@Timed` resource methods would get extra metrics, which could be used to measure execution time for asynchronous resource methods.  To write a test for this change (verify that `trackFilters` is enabled), I'd have to modify ""metrics"" in order to make that property visible. Not sure how that kind of thing is typically coordinated, or if this even needs a test.  If enabling this for everything isn't something you want to do, I could alternately modify ""metrics"" such that this is specified in the `@Timed` annotation itself, rather than (or in addition to) being configured globally for all metrics.","closed","improvement,","moxie0","2020-04-07T23:38:15Z","2020-04-08T05:46:08Z"

If it does not exist or is not an array setting, it will get added as a simple string setting, including the ‘,’ characters as part of the string.*  We ship our services in Docker Containers to be run in our customer's infrastructure and want to give them the possibility to configure rarely used configurations with System Properties. This includes for example the proxy settings of HTTP Clients. We don't usually configure this in our `config.yml` and don't want them to exchange it with their own. It is usually infrastructure-dependent and a manual exchange will possibly lead to compatibility problems in future updates of a service. But the setting `nonProxyHosts` is not settable when it is not defined in the `config.yml`, since the parser doesn't recognize the field as being an array/collection.  ###### Solution:   We propose to add a `ConfigurationMetadata` class that discovers the type of all fields and can be used while parsing the overridden properties. For now, it is only used to check whether a missing node should actually be an array.  This doesn't work well with inheritance in the configuration file (like the `ServerFactory` class in the default `Configuration`). The parser only works when a `defaultImpl` is registered. If it is missing, it can't discover any further properties.

"","2942","Support the simple: „Ignore unrecognized arguments“ use case | aka: Support executing Java 9+ Module applications","### Proposed Support  Please refactor *Dropwizard* to support executing a main class in a JPMS module by implementing the simple ability to ignore unrecognized arguments? An *argparse4j* contributor [*offered this as a basis*](https://github.com/argparse4j/argparse4j/issues/46#issuecomment-122288220) for this proposed ability.  ### Context  Several new command line options were introduced to the Java Development Kit to support Java 9's Jigsaw feature. Two of those are the *`--module-path`* and the *`-m`* switches. Used together, they make it possible to execute a *`Main-Class`* of a Java application exposed by a Jigsaw module.  [*This is the `java` tool's description*](http://bit.ly/JavaRefrnc) of the usage of those options:  ``` $java --help Usage: java [options]  [args...]            (to execute a class)    ...    or  java [options] -m [/] [args...]        java [options] --module [/] [args...]            (to execute the main class in a module)    ...  Arguments following the main class, source file, -jar ,  -m or --module / are passed as the arguments to  main class. ```   ### The Problem  Popular Java build tools append the following „*immutable system properties*“ to the end of every Java command that application developers explicitly specify:  ``` ...-Dfile.encoding=x-mac-roman -Duser.country=FR -Duser.language=fr -Duser.variant  ```  For example, consider the following *Dropwizard* application command line that would be produced by a build tool:   ``` java --module-path build/libs/my.dropwizard.module.jar -m my.dropwizard.module/io.my.DropwizardApp db status my_dropwizard_app.yml -Dfile.encoding=x-mac-roman -Duser.country=FR -Duser.language=fr -Duser.variant ```  *Dropwizard* uses *argparse4j* to implement its underlying CLI feature. The above „*`db status`*“ arguments are legal *Dropwizard* arguments. However, the „*`-D...`*“ system properties — *appended to the command by the build tool* — cause *Dropwizard* to fail to execute the application. Through *argparse4j*, *Dropwizard* reports an „*`unrecognized arguments: -Dfile.encoding...`*“ error to *`stderr`*:  ``` ... [ERROR] [system.err] unrecognized arguments: '-Dfile.encoding=x-mac-roman' [ERROR] [system.err] usage: java -jar authentication-application.jar [ERROR] [system.err]        db status [-h] [--migrations MIGRATIONS-FILE] [ERROR] [system.err]        [--catalog CATALOG] [--schema SCHEMA] [-v] [-i CONTEXTS] [file] [ERROR] [system.err] [ERROR] [system.err] Check for pending change sets. [ERROR] [system.err] [ERROR] [system.err] positional arguments: [ERROR] [system.err]   file                   application configuration file [ERROR] [system.err] [ERROR] [system.err] optional arguments: [ERROR] [system.err]   -h, --help             show this help message and exit ... ```  The combination of three popular Java technologies (*Dropwizard*, *argparse4j*, *Gradle*) makes it practically impossible to use a modern JDK's *`--module-path`* and *`-m`* options. When those three are used together they break any JPMS-architected application that needs to execute an application in a module. That is because the implementation details of each one, combines with the other two, to produce a situation that does not comply with the JPMS specification.  ### Steps to Reproduce  1. Clone or download [*this project*](https://bit.ly/mrJarZard) 2. Follow the setup instructions in that project's *`README`*, to configure and run the *Dropwizard* application 3. In the *`build.gradle`* located in the project's root directory, find the *`mrjar{}`* block of the *`project('authentication-application'`*) section of the script (*[go to line 96](http://bit.ly/mrJarWizL96)*) 4. Edit the *`mrjar`* block to be this:      ```     mrjar{         main = 'com.alexkudlick.authentication.application.AuthenticationApplication'         isModular = true         moduleName = 'com.alexkudlick.authentication.application'     }      ``` 5. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project 6. Enter *`./gradlew -i -Dconsole=verbose --debug authentication-application:run`* 7. Observe the *`[ERROR] [system.err] unrecognized arguments: '-Dfile.encoding=windows-1252'`* failure message   ### Expected Behavior  Just like the *Dropwizard/argparse4j* project in *Steps To Reproduce* section above, [*this other demo project*](http://bit.ly/mrJarularity) likewise implements a JPMS module that can be executed from the command. It, likewise, is built and ran using the *Gradle* build tool. However, the differences are     * the latter is not implemented with *Dropwizard/argparse4j*  * the later, therefore, ***is*** compliant with the *`java`* tool's expectations for executing a main class in a module  * its [*`mrjar{}` configuration*](http://bit.ly/etSvcsL37) has an *`isModular = true`* property     That is to say: *Unlike the Dropwizard/argparse4j project, the other project Just Works because it — as expected — simply ignores any command line arguments passed to it that it's not interested in*.  ### What Have You Tried So Far?  I have raised similar requests with both [*the argparse4j project*](https://github.com/argparse4j/argparse4j/issues/121) and [*the Gradle project*](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10825) .

Currently, the `ViewMessageBodyWriter.detectLocale` method is package private which makes it quite cumbersome to override.  ### Solution: Make `ViewMessageBodyWriter.detectLocale` protected  ### Result: We will be able to register our own ViewMessageBodyWriter implementation which overrides the `detectLocale` method in a nice way.","closed","improvement,","agavrilov76","2019-10-06T18:23:32Z","2019-10-06T20:01:34Z"
"","3421","Consider enabling HTTP client connection validation by default","# Why  dropwizard-client currently disables HTTP client detection for half-closed TCP connections [by default](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/de7581fabd358853e2853b80235a491c50443e0f/dropwizard-client/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/client/HttpClientConfiguration.java#L59-L60) ([PR which added this behavior](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/1181)). This can cause quite some surprises when enabling the `keepalive` option. Without this HTTP clients may attempt to issue HTTP requests via half-closed TCP connections resulting in either `SocketException`s or `NoHttpResponseException`s.  The following screenshot shows a DW server app sending a FIN/ACK to a DW client. The client established a TCP connection to the server via Apache HTTP client. Notice how the client ignores this and instead tries to reuse the TCP connection for a follow up HTTP request.  ![image (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/596443/90731864-8ae8b880-e2ca-11ea-8372-33eadf592a10.png)  One could interpret this as a misbehavior within Apache HTTP client. However this behavior [is documented](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/tutorial/html/connmgmt.html) (search for ""stale"" in the doc). Furthermore Apache HTTP client [by default](https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client/blob/bd3be1b86dc279cd5b55ec7a9c248578e9315328/httpclient/src/main/java/org/apache/http/impl/conn/PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager.java#L183) executes checks for half-closed/stale connections. Unfortunately though the Dropwizard default overwrites this to *disabled by default*.   # What  I'd propose to enable this check by default and to use the default value visible within Apache HTTP client. Seems like they revised the default [at least once](https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client/commit/6e6b8e5180e94da14efd60f4735416b9b873ae4b) so it seems like a sensible value to me.","closed","stale,","bripkens","2020-08-20T07:58:35Z","2020-12-03T00:13:10Z"
