"","248","Split out json package into separate module","Would you be interested in splitting out the ""json"" package currently residing in dropwizard-core into a separate dropwizard-json module?  Per the Dropwizard recommended package structure, I'm creating separate ""helloworld-api"", ""helloworld-client"" and ""helloworld-service"" modules.  In the api module, I'm using the JsonSnakeCase annotation which requires me to specify dropwizard-core as a maven dependency when all I'm really using in this case is the json package.  In my client module, I'm relying on the api module for my JSON structures.  The client module doesn't necessarily need the entire core of Dropwizard as its just an HTTP client that needs to know the JSON structures.  I can submit a pull request for this, but I wanted to check with you first.  Thanks a lot.","closed","","jplock","2013-01-18T17:28:50Z","2013-01-18T19:31:03Z"

This especially stands out in mixed Scala/Java projects.  Since Dropwizards' logging does nearly everything Logula does for us, lets use that and provide a simple Logging implementation to make it available via mix-in composition.  Note: adds new findbugs exclusion because the trait generates an inner-class name that disagrees with findbugs.","closed","","nicktelford","2012-03-21T12:51:46Z","2014-07-09T20:03:50Z"

A simple fix would be to have a Logging trait for scala that wraps the slf4j methods like so:  ```     def info(msg: String, params: Any*) {       logger.info(msg, params.map(_.asInstanceOf[Object]).toArray)     } ```  Alternatively, the scala module could use https://github.com/weiglewilczek/slf4s/ or http://software.clapper.org/grizzled-slf4j/.","closed","","tomdz","2013-01-17T20:46:29Z","2013-02-03T17:16:00Z"

"","371","Introduce dependencyManagement for major dependencies.","This is a set of changes to the POM files that introduce dependency management for Dropwizard's main dependencies (principally, those referenced by _dropwizard-client_, _dropwizard-core_ and _dropwizard-util_).  The motivation for suggesting this change is to allow projects that interact with Dropwizard (but are not themselves Dropwizard services) to reference Dropwizard's transitive dependencies without having to find, then specify, the version number.  Currently, the only alternative to finding the dependency versions and specifying them manually is to depend on a Dropwizard artifact then exclude the long list of everything you don't need - which is rather cumbersome and also requires updating when version numbers change.  If, for example, _dropwizard-client_ is referenced by a project, when that project is packaged up, it will pull in tens of megabytes of dependencies.  **Examples of why you might want to reference individual dependencies, rather than all of Dropwizard, include:** - You want to build **common libraries**, e.g. for logging, but don't want to pull in the full Dropwizard dependency for this, only the appropriate logging library - You want to build a Java-based **client for your Dropwizard service**, making use of Jersey and other dependencies, without depending on core Dropwizard code - Sections of your project may be **integrated with other applications**, and those applications should not depend on all of Dropwizard  **There is also a maintenance benefit to Dropwizard itself:** - Exclusions of managed dependencies only need to be specified **once in the parent POM**, rather than in every POM where they are referenced (e.g. the jersey-test-framework dependencies in the POMs for dropwizard-auth, dropwizard-core, dropwizard-hibernate and dropwizard-testing)  After these changes are made, projects that use Dropwizard can retrieve the versions of Dropwizard dependencies by specifying the following in their pom.xml, [as described by Apache](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Scope):  ```                                            com.codahale.dropwizard                 dropwizard-parent                 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT                 pom                 import                            ```  The equivalence of the managed dependency approach to the previous, unmanaged dependencies can be tested by running _mvn help:effective-pom_ against each project and comparing the dependencies section.","closed","","xako","2013-07-24T12:38:01Z","2014-07-04T14:48:00Z"

The use case is for servers that want all interactions to be over HTTPS and want to do HTTPS termination at the service layer.  The external connector is either all SSL or it is not, it does not allow for serving some things over HTTPS and some things over normal HTTP.  This patch is also back-portable to 0.3.1.  More generally, I think that DropWizard might benefit from the ability to invert the configuration of the connectors.  Perhaps introduce a Provider that can be instantiated by config but can also be overridden through some method on the Environment object.  In general, having this mechanism allows clients of the library to work around potential limitations in the config understood by DropWizard (and thus saves them from wondering things like when a patch they submit will get introduced into the code base so that they do not have to deal with their own fork and deployment into maven, which is what I am now wondering ;) ).","closed","","cheddar","2012-04-13T00:54:50Z","2014-06-14T05:33:35Z"

I found this necessary when integrating a service that used Guice and Jersey along with Jersey's Guice integration.  The nice thing about this is that it's a simple change but allows wholesale customization of Jersey while still keeping Dropwizard-specific features like instrumented resource methods. On the other hand, `getJerseyContainer` does get called before the service has a chance to initialize and that might make for some awkward init code on the service side. In my specific case that motivated this patch, the container implementation was being instantiated by Guice so all I had to do was to save the config for later injection to a custom `GuiceContainer` class (that comes with Jersey's Guice integration library). I think inverting the logic between `Environment` and `ServerFactory` and use a two-step configure/apply scheme to initialize the `ServerFactory` would make service initialization cleaner, but that seemed like too much surgery for what I wanted to accomplish.","closed","","tinkerware","2012-02-14T16:48:50Z","2014-06-28T15:37:10Z"

It would be great to have a HealthCheck API for server and maybe a SystemHealthCheck API under /systemHealthCheck for cross-system issues.

You should be able to put two different directories on the classpath with the same name.  For example, if you have   module1/web/javascripts module2/web/javascripts  And add module1/web and module2/web to your classpath, you should be able to reference resources from either directory.  But that doesn't happen because AssetLoader is storing a root URL (an instance variable named resourceURL).

Tests are of course included and should provide complete coverage of the changes.","closed","","nicktelford","2012-07-04T14:45:26Z","2014-07-09T19:30:58Z"

My clients expect JSON, all the time, even for errors. And more generally, keeping validation errors in code-friendly format seems to be a good idea. The current Dropwizard code (in Validator) discards all the juicy and useful violation information and instead crams the errors into a List of Strings.  Yes, you can use your own Validator, but that path is kludgy.   This patch introduces a handful of new classes and concepts: - ValidationResult, which is what the Validator will now return from calls to validate. ValidationResult contains the same List of Strings, but also contains a List of ConstraintViolations, so that callers can have more freedom to work with those as well. - InvalidEntityToJsonExceptionMapper, to use in place of InvalidEntityExceptionMapper. This mapper keeps the same 422 HTTP response, but the entity body is now a JSON array of (messageTemplate, message, invalidValue) tuples. - ValidatorConfiguration, a new top-level configuration that allows you to override the default InvalidEntityExceptionMapper, and can be configured by adding the following to your YML config.  here's the config snippet:  ``` validation:   invalidEntityExceptionMapperClass: com.yammer.dropwizard.jersey.InvalidEntityToJsonExceptionMapper ```  All tests pass and this is working great for me. There might be better/cleaner ways to do the overriding though (the new top-level config might be unpalatable for reasons I'm unable to think of), so I'm open to suggestions if there is a better way.","closed","","cobbzilla","2013-03-24T20:00:15Z","2014-06-14T08:37:14Z"

"","336","Metrics transitive dependencies being pulled in do not match the DW versions in all cases","Raised this one on the mailing list - some of the transitive dependency versions being brought in to DW by metrics don't match up. The easiest way to show this is to add:  ```                              org.apache.maven.plugins                 maven-enforcer-plugin                 1.2                                                               enforce                                                                                                                                                                                                   enforce                                                                             ```  to the POM then run a Maven verify. From memory the offenders are Jersey, Jackson Databind, JodaTime and Guava dependencies.  It's probably not the end of the world - we're getting tough on transitive dependency mismatches and I guess adding exclusions in DW will save us needing to do this in our poms.","closed","","mikeycmccarthy","2013-05-23T10:39:57Z","2013-05-23T19:55:06Z"

"","209","Include rootPath when logging end points.","Presently it can be a bit confusing when starting a Dropwizard service that overrides the HTTP rootPath in the config file because Dropwizard logs the end point paths, but doesn't include the rootPath.  For example:  ``` INFO  [2012-11-08 02:54:20,356] com.yammer.dropwizard.config.Environment:       GET     /resource1 (com.example.Resource1)     GET     /resource2 (com.example.Resource2) ```  The implication is that hitting http://localhost:8080/resource1 will result in the Resource1 resource being used to service the request.  In reality if a rootPath is specified, a 404 will be returned instead.  This change causes the rootPath to be emitted with the end points so that what ends up being logged is the complete path necessary to reach the resource.  For example, if rootPath were specified as `/api/*` then the preceding example would log:  ``` INFO  [2012-11-08 02:54:20,356] com.yammer.dropwizard.config.Environment:       GET     /api/resource1 (com.example.Resource1)     GET     /api/resource2 (com.example.Resource2) ```","closed","","bbeck","2012-11-08T02:59:12Z","2014-07-09T18:57:06Z"

Therefore, to ensure no loss in granularity you must use the most fine-grained `TimeUnit`:  ``` java public void schedule(Runnable task, delay: Duration) {     executor.schedule(task, delay.toNanoseconds(), TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS); } ```  While under the hood this is always translated to nanoseconds anyway, it creates potentially misleading code, as the reader may erroneously interpret such timings to be miniscule.  As a convenience, it'd be nice if we could ask `Duration` for its quantity and unit explicitly:  ``` java public void schedule(Runnable task, delay: Duration) {     executor.schedule(task, delay.getQuantity(), delay.getUnit()); } ```  The same is done for `Size` for consistency.","closed","","nicktelford","2012-06-20T14:16:45Z","2014-07-09T19:37:03Z"

To address this, I've added two public proxy methods to `ScalaService`:  ``` scala   def withBundle(bundle: Bundle)   def withBundle(bundle: ConfiguredBundle[_ >: T]) ```  These methods allow Service mix-ins to add the bundle like this:  ``` scala trait GraphiteReportingBundle {   self: ScalaService[_ <: GraphiteReportingConfiguration] =>    self.withBundle(new GraphiteReportingBundle)    /* snip */ } ```  Since these proxies are only added to `ScalaService`, it doesn't leak in to Java projects that don't support/require/want mix-in composition of bundles.","closed","","nicktelford","2012-06-01T10:16:29Z","2014-07-09T19:41:06Z"

Below you can find a simplish test case (I think the `Managed` stuff isn't really necessary, I just wanted to be sure everything is in a good state before I send my request). It won't happen in my naive JerseyClient implementation (switch the comments in `main`) and also won't happen with a `HttpClient` (switch the comments in `run`) unless you use a streaming `HttpEntity` and forget to wrap it in a `BufferedHttpEntity`.  Because it doesn't happen in `runNaiveJerseyClient` I think Dropwizard registers some magic which makes the Jersey client unhappy/forget to apply its `BufferedHttpEntity`.

Duration doesn't support negative values or explicit positive values, and after giving it some more thought, I decided that this type of thing is an entirely different concept than Duration anyways and the units Duration supports isn't directly in line with what JodaTime allows you to plus/minus from DateTime instances.  I've left out the ability to convert between units for now as this can get fairly complex for cases like converting days to months, etc.  I wanted to keep the functionality simply for representing an offset and applying it, not much more.

My specific use case is debugging: I just want to print out Configuration object as JSON during startup.  Related to this, I guess it might be also useful to expose config object itself via GUI (similar to /threads etc); but I leave that for future improvements. :-) (further ahead, really trying to dig into Jetty setup, JMX exposes only subset... but I digress).

"","314","Remove Jetty dependencies from StaticAssetServlet","I notice you're trying break DW into more modules.  You can remove `StaticAssetServlet`'s dependency on the Jetty API without affecting the functionality as follows:  The `ServletContext` interface has a method `getMimeType(String)` which delegates to the servlet container. Jetty's implementation of `ServletContext` actually does exactly what the existing DW code does.   So  ``` java final String mimeTypeOfExtension = mimeTypes.getMimeByExtension( req.getRequestURI() ); ```  becomes  ``` java final String mimeTypeOfExtension = this.getServletContext().getMimeType(                 req.getRequestURI() ); ```  And then you can remove the Jetty dependency and move the file into dw-servlets if you want.  You can see that Jetty's implementation of ServetContext exactly mimics DW's logic so this change can be made without affecting any existing applications:  https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-8/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/ContextHandler.java#L1369","closed","","fleaflicker","2013-04-26T15:56:34Z","2013-04-30T15:09:06Z"

The reason I have written this is so that I can use operating system standard locations and formats for configuration. I also plan on releasing this under the apache license as soon as I have it production ready.  That being said, It is quite difficult at this juncture to extend literally every configuration factory class just to set up defaults. I am open to other suggestions, like maybe allowing configuration via a map in application.initialize or something.","closed","","DorianGray","2013-10-09T01:08:38Z","2015-03-17T20:46:31Z"

This seemed simple: in default constructor of my sub-class I just tweak properties.  But the snatch is that properties are typically declared as private, and there are no mutators. My first inclination is to change properties to protected, so that my sub-class can change their values.  Alternatively I could add mutator(s), but this seems bit more convoluted. And changing access to protected would also make it possible for sub-classes to add mutators by those who... like, like adding setXxx() methods.

Taking these two into consideration it isn't obvious how to integrate Guice with Dropwizard.  The existing design forces us to create and register GuiceServletContextListener in Service.initialize() but we only gain access to Dropwizard's jersey configuration in Service.getJerseyContainer().  This means that we cannot pass Dropwizard's jersey configuration into the GuiceServletContextListener as expected. This means we cannot respect Dropwizard's configuration (I am forced to ignore it).  Furthermore, I argue that we shouldn't be forced to use DropWizard's custom configuration.

"","192","Expose JerseyTest from TestResource","Hi there,  ResourceTest does a lovely job of hiding the pointy edges in the standard JerseyTest, but could we maybe expose it to subclasses with a getter?  Due to a fantastic bug with the inmemory test container, I had to switch to the (slightly) heavier-weight http test container, but it freaks out when using client() because I haven't provided the base URI. Providing the base URI is proving difficult, given I can't access the getBaseURI() property on JerseyTest, nor can I access resource() on JerseyTest (which does set base uri ofc).  -Sam","closed","","samcday","2012-10-09T10:54:10Z","2012-10-09T15:27:35Z"

We have been looking and playing with dropwizard as a nice platform for cranking out services, but we have had situations where logging can stall requests.  This pull makes it possible to flip the dropwizard appenders over to async mode","closed","","GregBowyer","2013-06-04T03:19:33Z","2014-06-25T15:26:18Z"
"","319","Using partials templates in a resource directory","Hi guys,  (from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dropwizard-user/wECAU4INAIA)  Using DW 0.6.2, I'm facing problems with partial templates (mustache).  Let's say foo.mustache is the root template :  ``` Foo is working! {{> bar}} ```  and bar.mustache is a partial :  ``` Bar is working too \o/ ```  The two are located in a resource directory, let's say ${project.root}/src/main/resources/views, and called with a View implementation  ``` java FooView extends View {     private static final PATH_TO_TEMPLATES = ""/views/"";     public FooView() {         super(PATH_TO_TEMPLATES + ""foo.mustache"");     } } ```  If foo.mustache don't call any partial, everything works like a charm. But here with a partial call, DW logs complain about ""template bar.mustache not found"" (i.e. foo is still found, but not bar).  I think the way DW's View.class parse template name might be the cause : if the template name starts with a '/', path is kept for further processing. Maybe partial are only called by their name, and thus searched in the view package?","closed","","LeRiton","2013-05-02T16:18:09Z","2013-05-06T17:09:09Z"
"","204","Command don't preserve OptionGroup","Hi Dropwizard Community,  I've find a bug in Dropwizard Command class in `getOptionsWithHelp` method. ### Issue  This method copy user options in another options object and add an help option (-h) to print the usage.  During the copy the user defined option groups are lost. ### Solution  We just have to copy the option group :   ```     @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")     final Options getOptionsWithHelp() {         Options userOptions = getOptions();         final Options options = new Options();         for (Option option : (Collection) userOptions.getOptions()) {             options.addOption(option);             OptionGroup group = userOptions.getOptionGroup(option);             if (group != null) {                  options.addOptionGroup(group);             }         }         options.addOption(""h"", ""help"", false, ""display usage information"");         return options;     } ```  I've created a gist to demonstrate the bug :  https://gist.github.com/4016621  Regards,  Nicolas","closed","","nhuray","2012-11-05T10:56:46Z","2012-11-05T16:14:32Z"

My company over the past few months has found it invaluable.  This small modification was required as if one wishes to add bundles, resources, etc. in a generic fashion to a Dropwizard service and is using version 0.6.0 or later, one needs to establish an AOP-style cutpoint on the abstract initialize and run methods.  In previous versions of Dropwizard (namely 0.4.x and 0.5.x), this procedure was a bit more straight forward.  While I realize this may be a somewhat esoteric use case, this patch enables support for this functionality in a way which is completely opaque to users of Dropwizard, and hopefully shouldn't be a maintenance burden.

"","109","DropWizard should automatically log resource exceptions","DropWizard is awesome! Thanks for such a productivity booster! Even so, I found a little gotcha to share...  DropWizard should automatically log exceptions to console without the user needing to manually insert try-catch-log boilerplate to every resource method. This would reduce plumbing and improve usability.  I have the following gcwizard.yml config file: logging:    # Settings for logging to stdout.   console:  ``` # If true, write log statements to stdout. enabled: true  # Do not display log statements below this threshold to stdout. threshold: TRACE ```  … and there's a server resource with a simple method like so:  @GET @Timed @ExceptionMetered public Saying sayHello(@QueryParam(""name"") Optional name) { //    try {         dumpMetrics();         return new Saying(counter.incrementAndGet(), String.format(template, name.or(defaultName))); //    } catch (Throwable e) { //        LOG.error(e, ""gcwizard error in sayHello""); //        throw new RuntimeException(e); //    } }  When I call the service curl tells me that something failed, but it turns out the dropwizard service didn't log any stacktrace:  $ curl http://localhost:8080/gcwizard?name=foo There was an error processing your request. It has been logged (ID 46b4c2d7ea57bef0).  DropWizard console output isn't very helpful to diagnose the problem: … INFO  [2012-06-11 01:23:54,919] org.eclipse.jetty.server.AbstractConnector: Started InstrumentedBlockingChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080 INFO  [2012-06-11 01:23:54,923] org.eclipse.jetty.server.AbstractConnector: Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0:8081 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%0 -  -  [11/Jun/2012:01:23:57 +0000] ""GET /gcwizard?name=foo HTTP/1.1"" 400 72  2152 2152  Now, if I uncomment the try-catch-LOG block above and rerun I can see the stacktrace to diagnose the problem (see output further below). With this stacktrace I was easily able to fix my bug in calling some third party REST service (fix was to ask jackson to map JSON to Map.class instead of String.class). However, I believe I shouldn't have to manually add that try-catch-log boilerplate to every resource method since the doc at http://dropwizard.codahale.com/manual/core/#logging nicely promises to already do this:   ""Error Handling :If your resource class unintentionally throws an exception, Dropwizard will log that exception (including stack traces) and return a terse, safe text/plain 500 Internal Server Error response.""  What am I missing?  FYI, here is what my manual try-catch-log statement prints:  … INFO  [2012-06-11 01:22:54,639] org.eclipse.jetty.server.AbstractConnector: Started InstrumentedBlockingChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080 INFO  [2012-06-11 01:22:54,642] org.eclipse.jetty.server.AbstractConnector: Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0:8081 ERROR [2012-06-11 01:22:58,720] com.alpinefex.gcwizard.GCWizardResource: gcwizard error in sayHello !

The following error are now handled and better described: - _Malformed YAML_ - If it can't get parsed in to a JsonNode tree, it's malformed. - _Unrecognized field_ - Naming a field that doesn't exist on the target class. Provides suggestions, ranked by Levenshtein distance to optimize for typos. - _Incorrect type_ - If Jackson can't marshall the types (e.g. using a String when expecting an Integer).  When possible, it will include the most precise location information it has available.  Example:  ``` /etc/worldgreeter/conf.yaml has an error:     * Incorrect type of value at: server.applicationConnectors[0].port; is of type String, expected: Integer ```  `ConfiguredCommand`s now suppress stack-traces for `ConfigurationException`s, as they represent an error in the runtime configuration, which the stack-trace doesn't help with.  Caveats: - `commons-lang` is a dependency, for the Levenshtein distance implementation. - Jackson uses `JsonMappingException` to classify many different problems, making it difficult to handle more specific problems.","closed","improvement,","nicktelford","2013-07-23T17:05:59Z","2014-06-25T01:03:05Z"

"","22","Adds dropwizard-daemon contrib module","As discussed (briefly) on the mailing list:  Provides an Apache Commons Daemon (jsvc and procrun) wrapper around Dropwizard Services. Services and Configurations are defined as normal, but the user can optionally define a ServiceDaemon implementation that provides the daemon wrapper with a Service instance to wrap. #### The Good - Doesn't touch any core interfaces so existing Services can easily be wrapped by defining an additional class. - Services are only wrapped if launched through jsvc/procrun - you can still write your Service main() method as usual for running under other circumstances. #### The Bad - Commons Daemon recommends that priviliged operations (e.g. binding ServerSockets) is done in init() because it may (e.g. under jsvc) be called as a super-user before dropping privileges for calling start(). As we don't have access to the underlying socket binding, it has to be done in start() so may not have super-user privileges. #### The Ugly - This basically extracts the LifeCycle start behaviour from main() -> ConfiguredCommand.run() -> ServerCommand.run(). I didn't want to rock the boat too much so opted to duplicate code rather than refactor the LifeCycle management out to a more accessible place. This can be improved upon in the future. - No tests. I couldn't figure out how end-to-end LifeCycle testing is done in the rest of the project so omitted tests for now. Will add them if necessary.","closed","","nicktelford","2012-01-20T14:33:12Z","2014-06-13T21:42:53Z"

Because of this, no matter how verbose the Dropwizard logging level is set, it won't get those messages unless the JUL logger is also set to the same level or lower.  Two approaches to this are possible. 1. Set the Level for the root JUL Logger to `ALL`. This is the simplest approach, but has an overhead cost for processing log messages that are not emitted by Logback. This cost is further discussed in the [slf4j docs](http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html#jul-to-slf4j). 2. Add an instance of `ch.qos.logback.classic.jul.LevelChangePropagator` to the `LoggerContext`. This class listens for logger level changes and makes an equivalent change happen on the JUL Logger with the same name.  This patch takes the second approach. Unfortunately, since the listener needs to be added _after_ the LoggerContext is reset, but _before_ the logging levels are configured, the patch changes `configureLevels` instead of `hijackJDKLogging`. Let me know if you rather I refactor the logging configuration to make this cleaner.","closed","","christophercurrie","2012-05-24T19:02:01Z","2014-06-23T12:25:59Z"

"","115","Add Min/Max Constraints for Duration and Size","`Duration` and `Size` are highly useful for `Configuration` classes, keeping them human-readable. However, they're limited to validating manually using `ValidationMethod` only.  Specifying an upper and/or lower bounds on such parameters is a very common case, so lets start with implementations for `@Min` and `@Max`.  Unfortunately, because both `Duration` and `Size` convey more information than just a scalar value (the _unit_ of the value), we cannot simply use `@Min` and `@Max`. ## Duration  `@MinDuration` and `@MaxDuration` constrain the upper and lower bounds of a `Duration` respectively:  ``` java @MinDuration(value = 30, unit = TimeUnit.MINUTES) @MaxDuration(value = 1, unit = TimeUnit.HOURS) private Duration timeout = Duration.seconds(1); ```  The _unit_ defaults to `TimeUnit.SECONDS`, so you only need to name parameters if you're providing the unit explcitly:  ``` java @MinDuration(30) // 30 seconds minimum @MaxDuration(3600) // 3600 seconds (1 hour) minimum private Duration timeout = Duration.seconds(30); ```  Even if you define all `@MinDuration` and `@MaxDuration` constraints in seconds, this allows Configuration files to define value in any time unit that `Duration` understands. ## Size  `@MinSize` and `@MaxSize` work in much the same way as their sister constraints for `Duration` do, except they constrain a `Size`:  ``` java @MinSize(value = 1, unit = SizeUnit.KILOBYTES) @MaxSize(value = 1, unit = SizeUnit.MEGABYTES) private Size receiveBuffer = Size.bytes(1024); ```  The default value for _unit_ here is `SizeUnit.BYTES`, allowing you to easily define everything as bytes:  ``` java @MinSize(1024) // 1KB min @MaxSize(10240) // 10KB max private Size receiveBuffer = Size.bytes(1024); ```  Again, this allows `Confiuration` files to describe their properties using any unit that `Size` understands, whilst still being constrained correctly.  Tests included for happy merging. I was considering a `DurationRange` and `SizeRange` too, but I wanted to be sure this would be accepted before heading in too deep.","closed","","nicktelford","2012-06-20T17:28:33Z","2014-06-30T15:23:04Z"

"","523","admin interface hangs on 24-core machine","_Primary symptom_: on a machine with 22 or more cores and the default server configuration, the admin interface accepts TCP connections and then never processes the requests, causing a browser to hang forever.  This can happen on any machine given the wrong config parameters.  Details: - Server thread configuration must adhere to the following invariants, determined through debugging and trial and error:   - `maxThreads` > ∑ (`acceptorThreads` + `selectorThreads`) over all `applicationConnectors`   - `adminMaxThreads` > ∑ (`acceptorThreads` + `selectorThreads`) over all `adminConnectors` - Presumably what this means is that `maxThreads` _includes_ all the `acceptorThreads` and `selectorThreads`, and what's left over is used for handling requests. If there's nothing left over, the requests queue up and never get handled. - If this invariant is not satisfied, either the `applicationConnectors` or the `adminConnectors` (respectively) will accept TCP connections but then never handle them - DropWizard's defaults for `maxThreads` (1024) and `adminMaxThreads` (64) are fixed, while the defaults for `acceptorThreads` (#CPUs/2) and `selectorThreads` (#CPUs) vary on different machines. - So on a machine with 22 or more cores and an admin interface with 2 connectors (one for HTTP, one for HTTPS), the invariant doesn't hold for the admin interface.  With 342 or more cores and 2 connectors, it won't hold for the application interface.  There are potentially 3 parts to this bug: - DropWizard defaults should probably be made so they work on all modern hardware. - DropWizard should probably validate the configuration and fail to start if an invariant isn't satisfied, rather than silently hanging. - Perhaps the invariant should be documented. - Alternatively, the meaning of the parameters could be changed so that they are independent.  Using `maxThreads` only for processing requests (and not for selector threads and acceptor threads) might be more intuitive.  Tested with version `v0.7.0.rc3`.  How to reproduce: use the `dropwizard-example` application on a 24-core machine, or use the following server config on any machine:  ``` server:   minThreads: 2   maxThreads: 2   applicationConnectors:     - type: http       port: 8080       acceptorThreads: 1       selectorThreads: 1   adminConnectors:     - type: http       port: 8081       acceptorThreads: 1       selectorThreads: 1 ```  App starts successfully, but requests to either the application or the admin interface hang.","closed","bug,","jbyler","2014-04-03T17:57:49Z","2016-02-23T02:25:27Z"

Environment currently is a concrete class which is making adding new behaviors or even new frameworks on it very difficult. Changing concrete Environment class to Interface will provide tremendous easiness to your community.   First of all there are some requests regarding customizing return types for validation as JSON or something else by folks and me as well :) .New environment implementations easily provide custom validations.   There are also another benefits but the most interesting one is creating different environments based on other frameworks such as Spring MVC. Last week I had to port a legacy application to Dropwizard and had to use Spring MVC. I had to copy almost all core elements such as Bundle, Task, Environment etc.. After duplicating 10-12 classes I can successfully created a new Dropwizard environment. I even successfully removed Jersey Servlet and dependencies. At the end I had a new **a simple, light-weight application by stable, mature libraries**.   What do you think about this?","closed","","cemo","2013-03-03T23:53:55Z","2013-04-30T20:01:39Z"

The override for this looks like:  ``` -Ddw.server.applicationConncetors[0].port=9090 ```  Additionally, properties inside maps that have '.' in the name cannot be overridden.  For example, setting hibernate properties in database config:  ``` database:     url: jdbc://...     properties:         charSet: UTF-8         hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto: create ```  This pull request also addresses this issue by adding support for properties inside maps.  The overide for hbm2ddl above looks like this:  ``` -Ddw.database.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=none ```","closed","","cmicali","2014-02-04T20:00:09Z","2014-07-09T16:47:05Z"

Dropwizard depends on jackson-annotations 2.3.1 but most jackson 2.3.1 dependencies for some reason still depend on jackson-annotations 2.3.0 2. Dropwizard depends on slf4j 1.7.6 but metrics-\* depend on slf4j 1.7.5  **Reproduction** 1. Download **pom.xml** from https://gist.github.com/cmicali/9292420 and put it in any directory 2. Run **mvn install**  Expected: Build success Actual: Enforcer error showing the above 2 dependency convergence errors  **Proposed Fix** 1. Switch jackson dependency back to 2.3.0 - unclear why 2.3.1 has dependencies to annotations 2.3.0, and there is nothing newer 2. Exclude slf4j dependencies on all the metrics dependencies - there is no newer metrics version available and 1.7.6 seems to have some good fixes http://www.slf4j.org/news.html","closed","","cmicali","2014-03-03T18:00:44Z","2014-07-09T16:28:53Z"
"","277","Add parameter validation for resource methods","**Backstory:** A parameter like `@QueryParam(""name"") String name` is optional. `name` becomes `null` if the request doesn't include the parameter. (Unless the parameter type is `Optional`, in that case the parameter becomes `Optional.absent()`.)  It would be great if there was some way to mark parameters as mandatory, making Dropwizard automatically return HTTP status code 422 if they are missing. I currently have to write boilerplate code to make sure all parameters are present.  Relevant issues: - http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-351 : Parameter Validation - http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-399 : Add support for `@Required` attribute on a parameter  **Keywords**: parameters, mandatory, optional, non-optional, required","closed","improvement,","qerub","2013-03-07T17:08:20Z","2014-11-09T14:17:51Z"
"","46","Allow admin to be disabled","(This _should_ be the final nail in the getting-dropwizard-to-work-on-heroku-out-of-box coffin.)  [Heroku kills processes that bind to more than one port](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#r11__bad_bind), which doesn't exactly jive with having the admin servlet bind on a separate port. Ideally the admin servlet could live on ""/admin"" with some http basic auth guarding it, but it seems like that would require rejiggering ServerFactory quite a bit. This is a quick and dirty solution that should get people up and running on Heroku.","closed","","michaelfairley","2012-03-07T09:01:27Z","2014-07-09T20:09:54Z"
"","372","Refactor Jetty/HTTP server out of dw-core and into new dw-server","(In reference to comments on #349.)  **Motivation** Using Dropwizard right now requires the use of Jetty. Not all backend services are built on Jetty/HTTP (e.g., Netty). These commits move all Jetty/HTTP specific functionality into a new project, `dropwizard-server`. Project `dropwizard-core` is refactored to operate on more abstract [Guava Services](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ServiceExplained).  This change will make it possible to configure and launch any application using Dropwizard and its conventions but without including the Jetty runtime (small Jetty utility libraries are still used).  **Changes** All server-related functionality moved out of dw-core and into dw-server. Rather than expecting Jetty's `Server`, `ServerCommand` is now just a specific instance of a new `ServiceCommand` that operates on `Service`. `Service#addListener` is used to carry out the lifecycle operations that had previously been delegated to Jetty.  **Notice** I don't mean to dump a lot of changes on you at once, I just wanted to have something concrete to point to for discussion.","closed","","fleaflicker","2013-07-24T19:57:59Z","2014-06-19T20:57:22Z"
