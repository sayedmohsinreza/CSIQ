"","2457","Possible race condition causing invalid responses to requests (dropwizard 1.0+)","When we attempted to upgrade several of our projects from dropwizard 0.9.2 to 1.x, we ran into a bizarre, intermittent bug under high load that proved rather difficult to track down. The bug manifests as HTTP 400 responses to what should be valid requests; or, worse, certain requests receiving a the wrong response entirely (receiving the response for a different, earlier, request).  I have narrowed down the bug to a detectable race in `ByteBuffer` access within jetty ([link to the discussion here](http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jetty-dev/msg03192.html)), but the root cause is still unknown. I *have* managed to reproduce it outside of our product's codebase, using a simple dropwizard server consisting of the getting started tutorial, with some minimal modifications. I'm working through the pipeline to getting the repro published, but in the meantime, I wanted to share what I can about the conditions needed to recreate this, in case anyone has seen it before (or runs into something similar).  The repro consists of a tiny dropwizard server, essentially the getting started tutorial, with two main API endpoints that are accessed at high load by a client. I'm not sure both are needed, but I haven't gotten around to trying anything simpler:  ``` GET /category/{categoryName} GET /category/{categoryName}/item/{itemName} ```  There's one notable change we did make to the standard configuration--enable logging globally at the `DEBUG` level, but drop anything below `INFO` at the appender level. We did encounter the bug without this custom logging config, but based on local testing, this makes the bug significantly easier to repro:  ``` logging:   level: DEBUG   loggers:     ""io.dropwizard"": INFO   appenders:     - type: console       threshold: INFO       target: stdout       logFormat: '%d{ISO8601,UTC} %5p %mdc{debug-request-id:-na} %logger{40} - %m%n%rEx' ```  The bug repros across all of dropwizard 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and even 1.3.

I'm torn on the what types minResponseDataRate / minRequestDataRate should be. They are currently numeric, but seeing just an `100` in a configuration file is not conducive to its meaning (number of bytes per second, as in if someone is sending less than `100` bytes per second, respond with a 408). I like how in https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/2384 we were able to use a `Duration` to convey how to throttle logging messages. I was looking into migrating to `Size` but I couldn't think of a descriptive name (and it would also be a breaking change), so I left it. But if we're going to make the switch from long to Size we should probably do it soon as the minRequestDataRate is a relatively new know (1.3.0), so it's usage may not be terribly widespread.

We've had 2 senior architects spend 3 weeks trying to get it to work and HK2 fails to play nicely with Spring no matter what.

The only solution seems to write a custom HK2 service locator that just fetches the beans directly from Spring and hope that works.  However, Dropwizard seems to offer no API to allow defining a custom ServiceLocator in HK2 to override the default one.

"","1849","Log when application was gracefully stopped","We currently ran into an issue with some of our `io.dropwizard.lifecycle.Managed` objects taking quite long to stop. When deploying, we kill the java process if it doesn't gracefully stop after some time. It took us some time to figure out, that the application did not stop gracefully.  So we increased the time to wait, until we treat the application as unstoppable. Then we checked the logs for the managed objects to figure out, if everything was stopped properly. Later, we added a dummy managed object as the first managed object, which just logs that it was stopped. Since it's the first one, it will be stopped last. So if it logs something, everything else was stopped properly.  What would have really helped in our situation (and would not be as hacky as adding the dummy managed object), would be a final log statement (similar to `io.dropwizard.server.ServerFactory:  Starting myApplication`) which is logged at the very end of the application's lifetime (after all managed instances were stopped).  What do you think about that? If this feature is something you guys wish to have, just point me into a direction and I'll provide a PR.","closed","","scho","2016-12-09T08:58:37Z","2016-12-13T13:21:21Z"

"","1820","Finer-grain control of exception behaviour in view renderers","This PR is one possible implementation of issue #1811. In short, I am standardizing the exception thrown by each `ViewRenderer` implementation as `ViewRenderException`, which is then caught and rethrown as `WebApplicationException` by `ViewMessageBodyWriter`.  To preserve previous behavior of returning an HTML error response on render exceptions, I have added a new `ViewRenderExceptionMapper` class which should be registered. Consequently I am still changing the original behavior by adding this registration requirement. Let me know if this is OK from backward-compatibility standpoint - if needed we can register the mapper in `ViewBundle`, although I don't know how I can register another exception mapper afterwards if I want custom behaviour. This also requires change to the documentation.  Otherwise, one can choose to provide their own `ExceptionMapper` to catch `WebApplicationException` and check that the cause is `ViewRenderException`, then do whatever is needed with its cause in the form of an exception thrown by the rendering code (Viewmarker, Mustache, etc.)  I tried updating the tests to verify both cases of with and without `ViewRenderExceptionMapper`, but I can't seem to get registration in each test case working like this:  ` target(""/test/bad"").regsiter(new ViewRenderExceptionMapper()).request().get(String.class);`  I had to register the mapper in `configure()`. Please let me know if you have any solution to this so I can increase the test coverage.  Thanks.","closed","improvement,","acwwat","2016-11-15T02:27:45Z","2016-11-18T08:51:50Z"

The changes are (from most to least significant):  1. SizeUnit.Kilobytes, SizeUnit.Megabytes, SizeUnit.Gigabytes, and SizeUnit.Terabytes have been modified to properly represent the OSI definitions of these units (multiples of 1000, rather than 1024). 2. SizeUnit.Petabytes, SizeUnit.Kibibytes, SizeUnit.Mebibytes, SizeUnit.Gibibytes, SizeUnit.Tebibytes, and SizeUnit.PebiBytes were added and all runtime and unit test code was modified to use the binary versions of these units. 3. Additional text suffixes were added to Size.java. 4. Existing unit tests for Size and SizeUnit were modified for the new numeric definitions of the OSI units and additional unit tests were added for the IEC binary units.  As I mentioned on the issue, this is not a trivial change. It had wide sweeping effects in the Dropwizard unit tests - though I tried my best to be as minimal with the changes as possible. However, the biggest hit will be taken by dropwizard users that expect KB to mean 1024 and don't really know what KiB is. Though most of the storage industry now recognizes these IEC suffixes, the rest of the world is still getting familiar with them. To make dropwizard effective in the enterprise storage industry, however, these changes really should be made.","closed","","jcalcote","2017-09-16T06:57:10Z","2019-03-14T22:31:37Z"

To use this feature, add the new, Mustache-specific config option called `fileRoot` pointing to the directory in the file system where Mustache templates should be loaded. When specified, a `FileSystemResolver` will be used instead of `PerClassSystemResolver`. When combined with the new cache options from #1289 , you can update Mustache templates in the file system and Dropwizard will pick up the changes w/o restarting the application.  From implementation point of view, please see whether there is a better way to handle the tests. AFAIK each `JerseyTest` class can only configure the server once normally, so I cheated and added an instance variable to store the `MustacheViewRenderer` object, such that I can configure it. For each relevant test, I then added a ""load from file system"" version of the test by configuring the renderer with the `fileRoot` and `cache` option.

This PR includes `AbstractParamConverterProvider`  along with a slight enhancement to the *Param classes that returns messages that include the name of the parameter that failed validation, like _""query param user_id is not a number.""_  **Hibernate ParameterNameProvider** Small change to move most of parameter naming logic from `ConstraintMessage` to `JerseyParameterNameProvider`.

The fix is instead of closing all appenders, wait for them to flush all their log messages (which, as far as I can tell, was the original impetus for closing the `LoggerContext` on application shutdown, anyways)  In tests, the logging is reset to a sane default (I've chosen the default console appender as a default), so that users may still see the output of logging statements in their tests code (outside application code).  1. It's probably prudent to not merge this for 1.1.0 as logging is finicky, even though I've included a decently thorough test case (there's an API change to `LoggingFactory` 😞 to communicate resetting for tests).

It provides a good interopability with the server implementation. Despite that HTTP/2 is a standard, there could be some > idiosyncrasy .

If we want to go this route we'll have to wait for the release, and then implement the appropriate metrics in Dropwizard Metrics, and finally update dropwizard client. Additionally we may have to wait for HTTP2 support in Jersey (no idea if this is the case).

As it is implemented now, this is a **BREAKING** change. Anyone who updates Dropwizard to a version with this change will get compilation errors and need to add an additional `String` parameter to all their `Task` subclasses.  I went with the breaking API change style because it was the simplest, but I would like feedback on whether that seems like a reasonable path forward. it seems like the alternatives would be: 1. Make a subclass of task that accepts a post body e.g. `TaskWithBody` that has a different execute method. Dispatch to either `Task` or `TaskWithBody` in the task executor. (might actually make sense to switch it around and have the body version be the superclass) 2. Instead of passing the body directly to execute, just add a `getBody` method to the `Task` class 3.

"","2102","Performance issue with logback-acess","There seems to be a serious issue with the logback-access change on dropwizard. Unfortunately I don't have time to isolate the issue and provide a test case to reproduce it at the moment, but I will try to do that as soon as I have the time. I apologize for that but I think it's important enough to submit an issue anyway.  We have a test case for performance which involves 4 different dropwizard services which makes http requests to each other as well as serve requests from outside. We have realized that these services took a really big performance hit after dropwizard upgrade from 1.0.x to 1.1.x. After spending long time to figure out what's going on (insert microservices rant here), I realized that the bottleneck service was hitting the jetty maxThreads very quickly sometimes. Yet it was reporting only milliseconds in the request logs. So it means somewhere in jetty was hanging, leading to thread hogging.  Finally, via profiling the bottleneck service, I came across this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5628051/28066888-23016966-663f-11e7-8c0e-5c757108b22d.png) Jetty's BlockingArrayQueue is also used by `AsyncNCSARequestLog` it seems.  Reading the dropwizard documentation and release notes, decided to disable the request logging which fixed the performance and thread hogging problem.   ```   requestLog:     type: classic ``` also solves the problem.  Considering the complex nature of our 4 services and the running test which makes many requests to different services, there may be many things triggering this rather than logback-access having problems with heavy load. But there is definitely a problem here.","closed","","natnan","2017-07-11T11:50:25Z","2018-06-25T09:41:19Z"

Guava has been (or was; see [New Guava compatibility policy](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/guava-discuss/rX-QXo-67ZU/gLEvfV4CAwAJ)) breaking backward compatibility quite often.  That imposed problems to people using Dropwizard to implement an application using another framework pulling in a different version of Guava, for example Apache Spark.  With the removal of Guava, these use cases would be easier to implement, and with Java 8 and later, there isn't too much critical functionality left which Guava contributes to Dropwizard.  This PR removes Guava from Dropwizard and replaces the [Guava Cache](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained) with [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine).  If we wanted to be independent of a specific caching implementation, we could probably use JCache (JSR-107) and [Caffeine's JCache adapter](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/JCache) internally.","closed","","joschi","2018-06-19T14:45:25Z","2019-09-13T07:05:57Z"

Which gave the following description how includes work;  ---  #### Filtering  If you want to filter only a few metrics, you can use the `includes` or  `excludes` key to create a set of metrics to include or exclude respectively.  ~~~yaml metrics:   frequency: 1 minute                       # Default is 1 second.   reporters:     - type: datadog       host:        includes:         - jvm.         - ch. ~~~  The check is very simplistic so be as specific as possible. For example, if  you have ""jvm."", the filter will check if the includes has that value in any  part of the metric name (not just the beginning).  --- After trying a lot of different configurations I checked the code to see if this was really the case. For now I used a regular expression to fix my problem, but I would like to improve the code to adhere to the description above.

We require users to implement a custom auth filter to inject a dummy `SecurityContext` for unauth'd requests.  I had occasion to write such an endpoint at work and decided to take a stab at supporting `Optional` principals with the `@Auth` annotation. With this patch, I'm able to do things like this:  ``` @GET public String getGreeting(@Auth Optional userOpt) {   if (userOpt.isPresent()) {     return ""Hello, "" + userOpt.get().getName() + ""!"";   } else {     return ""Greetings, anonymous visitor!""   } } ``` This change breaks down into two steps:  1. A new `ContainerRequestFilter` decorator is used to silence exceptions thrown by failed `AuthFilter` invocations. This results in every request succeeding and principals being injected into the `SecurityContext` of auth'd requests. 2. An `OptionalPrincipalContainerRequestValueFactory` class is used to return the optional principal rather than throwing on its absence.  These two new classes are wired into `AuthDynamicFeature` and `AuthValueFactoryProvider` and their polymorphic equivalents. Tests are added to verify the behavior of each combination and the auth section of the used manual is updated to reflect this new capability.","closed","improvement,","evnm","2017-02-17T00:28:20Z","2017-02-22T02:58:21Z"

This moves the responsibility to the user. Therefore a guide has been written under the form of Javadoc for the `UnitOfWorkAspect` class. It basically says how to properly use the aspect, as intended by the original developer of `UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory`.  For instance, my original Guice solution took 300 lines of code, made heavy use the included proxy mechanism as well as an extra one and Objenesis, and was prone to memory leaks for some of the slightest changes.

Since dropwizard projects are almost always run in webserver mode I was wondering if there was a plugin/extension to automatically generate project specific docs (using sphinx or some other similar tool) and embed them into the dropwizard project itself. it could be hosted on the admin port at something like /docs What would be also interesting is if it could integrate with some rest api documentation tool such as swagger-ui to automatically scrap/build docs from the rest resouces and host them on the admin port at /docs/api (or something along those lines). I understand dropwizard already support hosting of HTML pages and pages generated with template engines such as mustache and Freemarker. In this case all the HTML + javascript would be statically generated so it should theoretically be hostable by dropwizard.  Does something like this already exist or has someone done something similar? Does this seem useful to people or is it really niche? I always found good documentation as one of the weak aspects of most projects, providing a mechanism to easily generated and integrate docs into projects seems like a relatively good idea to me. Reason i mentioned sphinx and swagger is that they both are heavily themable (to match project/company style) and already seemed to be used by dropwizard users.","closed","","jessechahal","2018-05-03T21:34:02Z","2019-03-06T20:24:04Z"

Such services usually become expensive when their usage quota is exceeded.  The proposed feature aims at providing a safety net when the application logging goes out of control.  Two new logging configuration parameters are introduced and can apply to any logging appender: - `throttlingTimeWindow` is a `Duration` defining a sliding window for throttling. By default, it is not set and throttling is disabled. - `maxMessagesPerThrottlingTimeWindow` is the maximum number of messages sent during the throttling time window. Once this number is reached, messages are silently discarded until there is room for new messages in the sliding time window.","closed","feature,","ochedru","2018-06-11T12:18:02Z","2018-06-22T21:50:59Z"

It would be great to have timeouts for each tests, so even in case we have errors, the whole test suite won't fail.

"","1799","Reload certificate configuration at runtime","Recent Jetty releases have allowed us to reload ssl/tls information at runtime, so it's no longer necessary to restart Dropwizard to install a new certificate. More information can be found: https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/918  The motivation behind this PR is that as certificate management starts to be more automatic (looking at Let's Encrypt) and certificates are issues more frequently, the downtime caused by new certificates starts to become palpable. Yes, the service may only be down for a few moments, but any reductions in downtime should be welcomed.  Those who use a TLS termination proxy in front of dropwizard (or use http endpoints) will not be affected.  I implemented a quick check to ensure it's working  ``` keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -keysize 2048  # add to config.yaml # start dropwizard  rm keystore.jks keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned2 -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -keysize 2048 curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8081/tasks/ssl-reload' ```  I can confirm that the certificate was indeed changed without needing a restart. 🎉   I marked this PR as RFC (request for comments) to get a feel of opinions. This PR is not ready to be merged.  Questions:  - determine where `SslReloadBundle` / `SslReloadTask` should live. Right now, they reside in the e2e module, which shouldn't be their final resting place 😝    - Add `SslReloadTask` to dropwizard-servlets with other `Tasks`?   - Add `dropwizard-ssl-reload` submodule?   - Something else - is an admin task the right way to reload configuration? Other ideas could be a filewatcher for automatic reloading... - is hooking into jetty's lifecycle handler appropriate? I feel like it resulted in a rather concise and elegant solution (if maybe a bit shortsighted -- ie. too opinionated). - what should the behavior be if one of the new configurations is misconfigured? Stop reloading or continue with the rest?  Todos:   - [x] tests - [x] documentation","closed","improvement,","nickbabcock","2016-11-03T03:13:44Z","2016-11-07T15:44:13Z"
"","1877","Add configuration hooks to UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory","Ran into a situation where I want to be able to do some configuration sessions that are set up by the `UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory`. Specifically, in our app I wanted to set up a bunch of default hibernate filters that should be turned on for every session.   In our resource methods that use `UnitOfWork`, we do that by implementing Jersey event listeners with lower priority than the UnitOfWork listener. I wanted to do something similar and poke some configuration in between the session being set up, and my code actually running.  With the current state of things (using 1.0.5) that required us to rewrite our own version of `UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory`. Additionally, because `UnitOfWorkAspect` is still package private in the latest release, we also had to copy and create our own version of that.  I spiked out what this change might look like in this PR, it simply takes in two lambdas for a before and after configuration and provides the session factory to both. I'm open to feedback on other approaches to solve this, but I figured the discussion is easier if there is some code.  Let me know any feed back on if this change in general seems reasonable, and on the specific implementation I added.","closed","improvement,","scottaj","2017-01-12T01:24:57Z","2021-03-23T22:43:06Z"

"","2246","Allow dynamic constraint validation messages","Previously, once a validation constraint was evaluated the entire string was cached. The impetus for a cache is that reflection is used to determine if we need to prefix an error message with additional context (eg. ""query parameter x ...""). Repeatedly calculating this prefix is wasteful -- thus the cache was born.  The biggest issue with this cache is that while it worked with all Hibernate Validation default message templates, it failed for message templates that contained the invalid value (eg. ""query parameter x ({validatedValue}) is greater than {value}""), as the same error would be returned regardless of validatedValue. It would also fail for custom constraint validators that didn't return the same message everytime.  The fix is to switch the cache from caching the entire error message to just the error prefix (eg. ""query parameter x"", ""return value"", no prefix).  This has no effect on performance and will allow for more custom validation messages in Dropwizard.

But the problem is that if I have a sequence of rapid requests to the server like 1000 requests, it only logs about 50 messages in the log file. I doubt it's because the log formatting costs much.  And if I try the classic request log configuration which generates logs in common log format, which does not meet my requirement. Like the following configuration. requestLog:     type: classic   And send 1000 requests to the server. The 1000 request can be all logged into the log file. Nothing missing.  Why does it lose logs when I use custom request log format? Now the documentation about request log has too many TODOs. Could someone please add some custom information to it?

They'll try wrapping the dropwizard configured client like so (Java8 example):  ``` java RxCompletionStage.from(client); ```  This is very bad because this will not use the executor carefully crafted by dropwizard, but instead use `ForkJoinPool#commonPool`, which is, by default, created to only have as many threads as there are numbers of CPUs - 1. The end result is that many requests will end up blocking, the exact opposite of what a user may think by using this API.  This commit introduces an rx-capable client that wraps the dropwizard client with the dropwizard created executor so that both `async` and `rx` methods can take advantage of the same thread pool, something that is more intuitive than the current behavior.  Jersey supports four different reactive libraries and this commit works with any of them and all future versions.  An alternative implementation would be to expose the executor that dropwizard cofigures, but I find the approach taken in this commit better.","closed","improvement,","nickbabcock","2016-09-07T02:53:55Z","2016-09-21T14:45:43Z"

To avoid this we could remove `Level` deserializers and move converting a string text level to Logback's level to `DefaultLoggingFactory`.

(Code is 100% not complete with all annotations it should have, it there just as an example)  ```java public class User {    private Set roles;    public Set getRoles() {     return roles;   } } ``` ```java public class SecretProject {    private User user;    public User getUser() {     return user;   }    @ValidationMethod(message = ""Only admin can have SecretProject assigned."")   public boolean isUserAdmin() {     return user.getRoles().contains(""ADMIN"");   } } ``` You also create endpoint that will validate this entity before doing anything else, like this ```java public Response create(@NotNull @Valid SecretProject project) {    // DAO code } ``` ```js {    ""user"": {""id"": 1} } ``` But when using this endpoint with request entity specified above it throws NPE while validating because at the time of validation, Dropwizard didn't fetch `User`.  As use case I don't think it is that specific or that it doesn't make sense. Is there any workaround? Do I have to use different validation method?

"","1982","Improve error handling for Jersey's Exception that caused by client","If sending a POST request with a `Content-Type` header that is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and using `@FormParam` in resource method, an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown by Jersey and logged at ERROR level by `LoggingExceptionMapper`. Also, this is the same behavior as https://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2636.  This indicates that **users can easily output ERROR level logs in server side**. Therefore, I would like to prevent this.  ### Steps to reproduce  1. Create a new resource class and method that given the `@POST` and `@FormParam`. Note: `@Consumes` is optional because ignoring.  ```java @Path(""/"") public class EchoResource {     @POST     @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)     public String echo(@FormParam(""msg"") String msg) {         return msg;     } } ```  2.

Please refer to the following references for details.  Reference 1: [HK2 API documentation](https://hk2.java.net/2.5.0-b32/api-overview.html#Looking_up_services) > Services are sorted by (in order) the service ranking, the largest locator id (so that services in children are picked before services in parents) and smallest service id (so that older services are picked prior to newer services). Therefore the best instance of a service is a service with the highest ranking or largest service locator id or the lowest service id. The ranking of a service is found in its Descriptor and can be changed at any time at run time. The locator id of a service is a system assigned value for the Descriptor when it is bound into the ServiceLocator and is the id of that ServiceLocator. The service id of a service is a system assigned value for the Descriptor when it is bound into the ServiceLocator. The system assigned value is a monotonically increasing value. Thus if two services have the same ranking the best service will be associated with the oldest Descriptor bound into the system.

"","1941","Logging disabled after uncaught exception","If an uncaught exception is thrown in the `run` method of the `Application` class, this cannot be logged by the `main` method which started the application. Logging in the shutdown hook and ucaught exception handler is also disabled. This is due to the fact that in the event of a shutdown Dropwizard [runs a cleanup](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/7295c5faf42840325c161cc82ad4ed1db2bf8419/dropwizard-core/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/cli/ConfiguredCommand.java#L88) method in `ConfiguredCommand`, which stops the logging. In the event of an unexpected exception logging is required in order to debug the program.  This issue is similar to #1119.  I've got two workarounds:  1.  Catch all exceptions in the `run` method of the `Application`. However the method signature suggests that exceptions should be handled and can be thrown. The disadvantage is that logging in the shutdown hook and the uncaught exception handler will not work.  2. Create a new command `start` which extends `ServerCommand` and overrides the `cleanup` method with a no-op. This keeps the logging alive till the last moment of shutdown.   I would like configuration or a command option in order to prevent the logging from stopping instead of the current workarounds.   Class to reproduce the situation.

I faced up problem with some metrics with low calls count, that old metrics are kept for very long time. In result, graphs in Graphite show inaccurate values - old ones. The problem has been described in this article ""Don’t use Timers with exponentially-decaying reservoirs in Graphite' (http://taint.org/2014/01/16/145944a.html).  Author said that:  >  In reality, if the frequency of updates to such a timer drops off, it could take a lot longer, and if you stop updating a timer which uses this reservoir type, it’ll never decay at all. The GraphiteReporter will dutifully capture the percentiles, min, max, etc. from that timer’s reservoir every minute thereafter, and record those to Graphite using the current timestamp — even though the data it was derived from is becoming more and more ancient.  Workaround suggested by author is:  > What we eventually did in our code was to use this Reporter class instead of GraphiteReporter; it clears all Timer metrics’ reservoirs after each write to Graphite. This is dumb and dirty, reaching across logical class boundaries, but at the same time it’s simple and comprehensible behaviour: with this, we can guarantee that the percentile/min/max data recorded at timestamp T is measuring events in that timestamp’s 1-minute window — not any time before that. This is exactly what you want to see in a time-series graph like those in Graphite, so is a very valuable feature for our metrics, and one that others have noted to be important in comparable scenarios elsewhere.

"","2302","Issues with default JerseyClientBuilder","I've started using Dropwizard (1.2.4) recently and have been getting some weird behavior using the Jersey Client obtained through Dropwizard. I've followed the configuration steps from here (http://www.dropwizard.io/1.2.2/docs/manual/client.html#jersey-client) and have not overwritten any of the default configurations in my `.yml`.   When I retrieve the client via Dropwizard's `JerseyClientBuilder` to make a request I get a 403 response return. When I retrieve the client via `javax.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder` the request goes through fine.  I'm calling the downstream like: ```java  Order order = new Order();  // Set values within order (left out for readability)  client.target(""https://sample.com"")             .path(""/orders"")             .request()             .header(""Authorization"", ""XXX"")             .post(Entity.json(order)); ```  Order is a simple POJO that looks like below with each of the classes within it being simple POJOs: ```java public class Order {     private Amount totalAmount;     private Consumer consumer;     private Merchant merchant;     // Getters and setters for each of the variables above } ```  The client is instantiated like below in `Application.run` with client1 getting 403 and client2 getting a successful response: ```java final Client client1 = new JerseyClientBuilder(environment).using(configuration.getJerseyClientConfiguration()).build(getName()); final Client client2 = ClientBuilder.newBuilder().build(); ```  Another funny behavior with the client instantiated through the `JerseyClientBuilder` is that when I convert the `order` object into a JSON string using `Jackson.newObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(order)` request fails. When the JSON string has `\n` characters via `Jackson.newObjectMapper().writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(order)` the request succeeds.  Is there a configuration I need to set somewhere or is this possibly a bug?","closed","","andrewoh531","2018-03-13T10:24:26Z","2018-06-22T12:10:57Z"

"","1701","Can't add a ConfiguredBundle in another ConfiguredBundle without warnings","I'm using Dropwizard 1.0.0 and am running into an issue where I'm trying to have nested `ConfiguredBundle`s, so users only need to call `addBundle` for the top-level bundle. The problem is that the top-level bundle cannot call `addBundle` for its nested bundle using generics without getting warnings. Here is an example:  ``` // Bundle to be nested public class InnerBundle implements ConfiguredBundle {...}  // Bundle intended to be added by a consumer public class OuterBundle implements ConfiguredBundle {     // Add the InnerBundle as a nested bundle     @Override     public void initialize(Bootstrap bootstrap) {         ConfiguredBundle bundle = new InnerBundle<>();         bootstrap.addBundle(bundle);     } } ```  The call to `bootstrap.addBundle(bundle)` fails because `addBundle` takes a `? super T` where `T` is in the context of `Bootstrap`: https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/v1.0.0/dropwizard-core/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/setup/Bootstrap.java#L147. So it would seem to me that in the call to `addBundle`, the `ConfiguredBundle` must have a generic type that is a supertype of `Configuration` (by the signature of `addBundle`) but also a subtype of `Configuration` (by the signature of `initialize` which takes `Bootstrap`). In other words, the ConfiguredBundle must have generic type `Configuration`, which seems very restrictive.

Jetty would serve TLSv1.1 requests when the server runtime and client could agree on a cipher suite (nothing surprising here).  But by default, openssl could not communicate via TLSv1.1 with a Dropwizard server running on the latest oracle / openjdk versions. This can be verified with [sslyze](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze), where it only lists TLS v1.2 cipher suites as possible. While one can use an alternate provider on the server (bouncycastle) -- if by default Dropwizard doesn't expose a non-TLSv1.2 cipher suite, what's the point of enabling TLSv1 and TLSv1.1?   ###### Solution: Double down on the statement that [that only TLSv1.2 is enabled by default](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/1700), by disabling everything that is less secure.  ###### Result: Secure by default! If someone has allowed TLSv1.1 cipher suites they'll now need to reset the `excludeProtocols` to the defaults  ```yaml server:     applicationConnectors:         - type: https           port: 0           keyStorePath: keystore.jks           excludedProtocols: ```  On startup we'll see:  ``` Enabled protocols: [TLSv1.2] Disabled protocols: [SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1] ```  When TLS v1.3 becomes supported, it will automatically be picked up and enabled.","closed","security,","nickbabcock","2018-06-27T22:20:48Z","2018-06-28T10:40:46Z"

I somehow didn't want to go the easy way (_just turn off Gzip_), so I tried _a lot_: - modifying response headers in JAX-RS by `@Context`ing all kind of ServletContexts - intercepting in Jersey with a [Pre-Matching filter](https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/filters-and-interceptors.html#d0e9678) as well as a name-bound interceptor - servlet filters  Digging deeper I finally hit the underlying [Jetty `GzipHandler`](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/gzip-filter.html) which happens to have the perfect `excludedPath` (exclude a path from Gzip treatment) _and_ [`excludedMimeTypes`](http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/9.3.9.v20160517/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/gzip/GzipHandler.html) (exclude a MIME type) methods that would not require me to re-create the _positive_ whitelist of stuff that shall be Gzipped (supported in configuration)...  I guess this should be the result of `getApplicationContext().getGzipHandler()` but this one is `null` no matter where in the lifecycle. I ended up learning something about Jetty and came up with this (which works nicely):  ``` java //env.getApplicationContext().getGzipHandler(); // <-- this is always null? why?!? env.lifecycle().addServerLifecycleListener(new ServerLifecycleListener() {     @Override     public void serverStarted(Server server) {         Handler handler = server.getHandler();         LOG.debug(""Disable GZip for SSE: Starting with handler {}"", handler);         while (handler instanceof HandlerWrapper) {             handler = ((HandlerWrapper) handler).getHandler();             LOG.debug(""Disable GZip for SSE: Found handler {}"", handler);             if (handler instanceof BiDiGzipHandler) {                 LOG.info(""Excluding mime-type {} from gzip compression handler"", SseFeature.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS);                 ((BiDiGzipHandler) handler).addExcludedMimeTypes(SseFeature.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS);             }         }     } }); ```  I really think either MIME type `text/event-stream` should be excluded by default **or** flushing fixed somehow **or** at the blacklist be exposed for configuration **or** some special annotation to whitelist...

The crux is in `org.eclipse.jetty.util.security.CertificateValidator` which clearly says  > Convenience class to handle validation of certificates, aliases and keystores Allows specifying Certificate Revocation List (CRL), as well as enabling CRL Distribution Points Protocol (CRLDP) certificate extension support, and also enabling On-Line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support. IMPORTANT: at least one of the above mechanisms _MUST_ be configured and operational, otherwise certificate validation _WILL FAIL_ unconditionally.  Neither the Dropwizard documentation nor any tutorial / blog post ever pointed this out. I suggest to either add it to the documentation or to even add a check to config file validation that assures that at least one revocation check method (CRL, CRLDP or OCSP) is enabled.","closed","needs code,","lpeterse","2016-08-26T07:53:42Z","2017-02-02T03:59:49Z"

With methods of setDefaultName it looks like a model to me, isn't this stuff suppose to go into entities? * `When this class is deserialized from the YAML file` which yaml file? Why is it deserialized? Why are we now talking about yaml when the configuration file itself is litered with JsonProperty annotations?  in IRC dreamreal (Joseph Ottinger. Used to be the editor of Java Developer Journal and then TheServerSide.com) has to say the following about it  ```  what's the purpose of this Configuration class?  http://www.dropwizard.io/1.1.0/docs/getting-started.html#creating-a-configuration-class   i see in the example methods like setDefaultName .. seems more like a model to me ..  it's a model for the *application*  don't really want to model my application at this moment  it also says  ""When this class is deserialized from the YAML file, ""  which YAML file ?  you're going to write a YAML file.  Well, default name is for the app to spit out by default. So that's your ""application model.""  Like if your app is to say ""Hello, world"" where ""world"" is paramaterized, ""world"" is the ""default name.""  spit out where ?  I don't know what the tutorial does - but given dropwizrd, I'm assuming it's going to start a webapp where you hit http://localhost/something  and yes, it'll be http://localhost:port/hello-world  and yes, it'll be http://localhost:8081/hello-world based on the rest of the configuration  ok that's not so obvious yet ..  i'll make notes  It is a tutorial that actually progresses as it goes along. I don't understand tutorial writers who do that, though.  I mean, why don't they SAY ""this is what we're working toward"" at the very beginning?  ""Getting Started will guide you through the process of creating a simple Dropwizard Project: Hello World."" ... no ""We're going to say 'hello world' through an HTTP endpoint, allowing us to change defaults through configuration and using a data representation model that we can change to fit our needs...""  that way, the ""configuration"" makes more sense and you know you're going to be creating something on the web... ```  * Loading templates and default values from YML seems not really necessary to get going, would be better if this was more obvious in the code itself.

"","1985","Enum `fromStringFuzzy` should trim() and replace inner whitespace with '_'","I think that the `Enums` class in `io.dropwizard.util` should `trim()` whitespace around the String and then convert inner whitespace to `_`. This way you can use space characters as delimiters too. ```java final String text = value.trim()             .replaceAll(""\\s+"", ""_"") // <- space can be used as a delimiter too             .replace('-', '_')             .replace('.', '_'); ```  Somewhere before version `1.0` or `1.1` of Dropwizard it was possible to use the `fromString()` method on Enums to convert Strings to the right Enum, but not they all go through `Enums.fromStringFuzzy()`, which eliminates any custom conversion logic.  That would be a different issue, but wouldn't it be helpful to check whether the custom `Enum` class actually implements a `fromString()` and only in case it doesn't, fall back to `final Enum constant = Enums.fromStringFuzzy(value, constants);` I guess this logic would go somewhere in `FuzzyEnumParamConverterProvider`","closed","","stefan-zh","2017-03-27T19:51:41Z","2017-11-23T19:16:43Z"

Therefore, the following class will give an error:      public class MyTestSteps {      Person saved;     Person unsaved;     PersonDAO personDAO;      @Rule     public DAOTestRule myDAORule = DAOTestRule             .newBuilder()             .addEntityClass(Person.class)             .build();       @Before(""@DAOTests"")      public void beforeDaoTests(){             personDAO = new PersonDAO(myDAORule.getSessionFactory());      }          @Given(""^I have an Object to persist$"")     public void iHaveAnObjectToPersist() throws Throwable {         unsaved = new Person(""John"", ""Doe"");     }      @When(""^I save it using the DAO$"")     public void iSaveItUsingTheDAO() throws Throwable {        saved = myDAORule.inTransaction(() -> personDAO.create(unsaved));            }       @Then(""^It is added to the database$"")     public void itIsAddedToTheDatabase() throws Throwable {         Assert.assertThat(saved.getId(),greaterThan(0L));     }     } The error would be on the DAO.create() function:      org.hibernate.HibernateException: No session currently bound to execution context  I can't call the before() and after() myself, since they are protected. so one way is to wrap DAOTestRule in a new object, expose the before() and after(), and call them in the @Before and @After functions:      ....     public MyExtendedDAOTestRule myDAORule = MyExtendedDAOTestRule             .newBuilder()             .addEntityClass(Person.class)             .build();      @Before(""@DAOTest"")     public void beforeDaoTests() throws Throwable {         myDAORule.before();     }      @After(""@DAOTest"")     public void afterDaoTests() {         myDAORule.after();     }     ....

"","2268","ProxyServlet does not set Content-Length correctly for gzipped content","I have a Dropwizard application that uses a Jetty ProxyServlet to forward HTTP traffic. This works great when the HTTP traffic is not gzipped. When the HTTP traffic is gzipped, the proxy forwards a bad HTTP request.  The problem appears to be that when Dropwizard receives a gzipped HTTP request, the BiDiGzipHandler processes the request before the ProxyServlet. When the BiDiGzipHandler runs, it decompresses the payload and strips the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header. It does not modify the `Content-Length` header to reflect the length of the decompressed payload. When the ProxyServlet processes the request, it blindly copies the now incorrect `Content-Length` header (that reflects the length of the gzipped payload). It forwards the decompressed payload as the body though. When the request is received, you can see that the `Content-Length` does not reflect the length of the actual HTTP body.  I set up a simple test to demonstrate the problem.  I am running Dropwizard 1.0.0. I configured a ProxyServlet to forward all HTTP traffic matching the _/echo_ path.  ``` // Register echo proxy ServletRegistration echoServletRegistration =     environment.servlets().addServlet(""EchoServlet"", new ProxyServlet.Transparent()); echoServletRegistration.addMapping(""/echo/*""); echoServletRegistration.setInitParameter(""prefix"", ""/echo""); echoServletRegistration.setInitParameter(     ""proxyTo"", ""http://localhost:47899""); ```  I CURLed a normal HTTP POST to Dropwizard and used netcat to print what the proxy forwarded:  _test.sh_ ``` #!/bin/bash  curl --data '@data.txt' \      -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \      -X POST \      http://localhost:8080/echo ```  _data.txt_ (length 19 bytes) ``` Hello, Dropwizard! ```  _netcat output_ ``` $ nc -l 47899 POST / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.57.0 Accept: */* Content-Type: application/json Via: http/1.1 Jordans-MacBook-Pro.local X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1 X-Forwarded-Proto: http X-Forwarded-Host: localhost:8080 X-Forwarded-Server: 127.0.0.1 Host: localhost:47899 Content-Length: 18  Hello, Dropwizard! ```  You can see the problem when I did the same thing gzipped.  _gzip-test.sh_ ``` #!/bin/bash  curl --data-binary '@data.txt.gz' \      -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \      -H ""Content-Encoding: gzip"" \      -X POST \      http://localhost:8080/echo ```  _data.txt.gz_ (length 48 bytes) ``` ã∫Ù}Zdata.txtÛHÕ……◊Qp) /(œ¨J,JQ‰}9¡∂ ```  _netcat output_ ``` $ nc -l 47899 POST / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.57.0 Accept: */* Content-Type: application/json Via: http/1.1 Jordans-MacBook-Pro.local X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1 X-Forwarded-Proto: http X-Forwarded-Host: localhost:8080 X-Forwarded-Server: 127.0.0.1 Host: localhost:47899 Content-Length: 48  Hello, Dropwizard! ```  I'm not really sure how to proceed. I think what I'd like is to remove the BiDiGzipHandler from the filter chain so the proxy just passes along the gzipped payload. Alternatively, I'm fine with passing the unzipped payload through the proxy if that's easier.  Is this a bug? Is there a work around in the meantime?

I'm trying to write a test to prove my new session data store works (as multiple applications share the session and I don't want to upgrade them all at the same time).  I'll try and generate a minimal example but thought I'd ask the question in case there was some knowledge I was missing...  So, I have a test class  ``` public class DoesMySessionSaveToRedis { } ```  and give it a DropwizardAppRule  ``` public class DoesMySessionSaveToRedis {     @ClassRule     public static final DropwizardAppRule RULE = new DropwizardAppRule<>(       TheApplication.class,       new TheConfiguration()); } ```  that has a test method that posts to an end point which I know causes session interactions.  then checks for the session in Redis.  I can see that my session data store is registered.  ``` @Override     public void run(TheConfiguration configuration,                     Environment environment) {          final TheResource resource = new TheResource();         environment.jersey().register(resource);          final SessionHandler sessionHandler = new SessionHandler();         sessionHandler.setSessionCookie(""MY_DESIRED_COOKIE_NAME"");         final NullSessionCache sessionCache = new NullSessionCache(sessionHandler);         sessionCache.setSaveOnInactiveEviction(true);          final RedisSessionDataStore sessionDataStore = new RedisSessionDataStore(new JedisPool(), new RedisConfiguration(configuration.getTimeout()));         sessionCache.setSessionDataStore(sessionDataStore);          environment.getApplicationContext().setSessionHandler(sessionHandler);     } ```  I can step through in the debugger and see that the application registers the session handler  When the AppRule actually runs it creates a `DropwizardTestSupport` which creates and `run`s a `ServerCommand`. When that `ServerCommand` runs it registers a `NullSessionDataStore` replacing my redis session data store.  Am I trying to do something impossible?

I would like these messages to exactly reflect what part of payload was wrong.  `ConstraintMessage.getMessage(violation, invocable);` This is the place where I obtain bad error message. `violation` object itself is holding proper message.","closed","","imochurad","2017-06-27T15:08:33Z","2017-09-01T14:41:54Z"

I've got both interactive_timeout and wait_timeout set to 30 on the MySQL instance, and am reasonably sure I'm not opening connections (handles) and not closing them. Are there Tomcat connection pool configuration options I should be using to free up connections (and where should they be entered? In the YML file I presume, but it is unclear in what form)  and why are they leaking in the first place? Any suggestions?

Here is how I am throwing them: in `VehicleResource.java`  ``` @PUT     @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)     public void updateJson(VehicleJson vehicle) {         try {             repository.update(new Vehicle(vehicle));         } catch (NoSuchElementException ex) {             throw new VehicleNotFoundException(""vehicle id "" + vehicle.getId() + "" doesn't exist"", ResponseType.JSON);         }     } ```  I tried adding the default exception mappers back in. When I do that, the `LoggingExceptionMapper` catches my exception and converts it to a default response. My code is here: [https://github.com/tanviapte/VehicleService](url) From what I see this looks like an issue. I'd be happy to help fix it if there is one. Has anyone run in to this?

"","1750","AssetBundle does not handle very large files + streaming","Hi,  My usecase: I wanted to have some large files to be accessible from the `AssetServlet`. For this, I added a location to my classpath so I could treat them as resources. In a later version I simply copied the `AssetServlet` and overwrote the `loadAsset` method to load the files straight from the file system.  I found a few issues with the servlet:  - The bundle does not handle very large files (well). It loads them into memory and access the byte array directly. With very large files and small heap, I believe this will cause memory issues. The Asset should probably use streaming instead of loading assets into memory.  - The bundle does not handle large files with range requests. The range requests are designed to only use integer values, so any range offset > MAX_INT will cause in a `NumberFormatException`.  - The `AssetServlet` makes the loadAsset method private. This was a bit annoying for me since I had to copy/paste the bundle to load the assets differently (e.g. not from the classpath). It would be nice if this could be visible so once could simply extend the Servlet and load the assets in whichever way. - the `ByteRange` class does not handle offset > MAX_INT.   For other reasons I had to switch to a jersey-resource, but essentially I added some code to make this possible:  - I made a copy of `ByteRange` that uses long values.  - I added a helper method that splits a `ByteRange` that handles > MAX_INT into pairs of (offset,length) chunks. This could probably also be handled by splitting it into multiple `ByteRange` objects instead. This is because java NIO restricts memory mapped files to MAX_INT as well and bigger chunks have to be read one-by-one and written into the output stream.   I don't know if the `AssetServlet` is designed in this way for a reason I am missing (possibly not wanting to access big resources as assets?) If so, please correct me and close the issue :) Otherwise, I'd be happy to try and create a pull request adding my code.

Previously, given an absolute path, logs would be written to a location based on the location of the JAR on disk. For instance, if I dumped my JAR in `/var/apps/foo`, and my logfile location was `logs/foo.log`, then I could expect my log file - on disk - to appear at `/var/apps/foo/logs/foo.log`.  With 1.0, it appears that the log files are created relative to the location from where the JVM process is started. This particular project uses Upstart to manage the running of the application, and the JVM process is started from inside Upstart. Therefore, the log file gets created relative to the Upstart log path, at `/var/log/upstart/foo.log`.  I've not yet fully worked out why this is, but I imagine the change might be due to a downstream dependency change. Any pointers to how to revert this back to the previous behaviour are welcome.","closed","","ajlanghorn","2016-08-23T17:19:05Z","2016-08-27T03:54:58Z"

When I have a config property, e.g.  ``` java @NotNull @JsonProperty(""foo"") private String baz; ```  and the config file does not include `foo`, I get a validation error telling me that `baz` is missing.  This confuses users when e.g. the documentation only contains the aliased property names.

I also tried with the dropwizard's `@Session` annotation but it's the same.   Is that normal or is there a bug somewhere?

"","2524","KeepAlive in Dropwizard Configuration","Hi! We are using Dropwizard 1.3.5.  First let me explain our current setup. We are using Dropwizard to configure an HTTP client used to send requests the an AWS ELB. The ELB then sends requests to our database instances.  Our ELB idle timeout is 60 seconds. The ELB responds to the client request with a `Connection: Keep-Alive` header but does not send a `keep-alive:...` header. In other words **the ELB expects the client to keep connections alive indefinitely until the ELB decides to terminate the connections**.  In the Dropwizard configuration we can only set the keep alive duration to 0 or greater. Dropwizard also overrides the `DefaultConnectionReuseStrategy` such that we can never fall into this case in the Apache HttpClient: https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client/blob/6f4550ff977a8f497822a17115572dcdb6e715b6/httpclient/src/main/java/org/apache/http/impl/conn/BasicHttpClientConnectionManager.java#L301. That case is the case that allows connections to be kept alive indefinitely.  It seems like a bug that we cannot create persistent connections using any keepAlive setting in Dropwizard. Is there a workaround or fix for this issue?","closed","stale,","nirajpatel","2018-10-10T05:20:55Z","2019-08-19T14:01:40Z"

I noticed in the docs here: http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.5/docs/manual/core.html#syslog-logging that logging to a unix socket isn't support: ``` Because Java doesn’t use the native syslog bindings, your syslog server must have an open network socket. ```  Is this a strict limitation within Java?

"","1590","+ take the tcp backlog from OS","Hi there.

When you do not specify the `acceptQueueSize` on the `ServerConnector`, Jetty is reverting to the default JDK setting as set in the `java.net.ServerSocket`, example (jdk8 - I check jdk6 has the same default of 50):  ```     public ServerSocket(int port, int backlog, InetAddress bindAddr) throws IOException {         setImpl();         if (port < 0 || port > 0xFFFF)             throw new IllegalArgumentException(                        ""Port value out of range: "" + port);         if (backlog < 1)           backlog = 50;         try {             bind(new InetSocketAddress(bindAddr, port), backlog);         } catch(SecurityException e) {             close();             throw e;         } catch(IOException e) {             close();             throw e;         }     }  ```  This is currently the case for our dropwizard apps in production (I performed an strace to 100% check this was the case - `strace -e trace=network -f`  - an `ss -lt` will also show it you)  ``` [pid  9831] bind(56, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(6000), inet_pton(AF_INET6, ""::"", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, 28) = 0 [pid  9831] listen(56, 50)  ```  This pull requests uses the same logic that Netty uses, to read the somaxconn setting from the environment, and set the `acceptQueueSize` to the OS value if readable.  or the defaults of 128 for *nix systems and 200 for windows.

For instance, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Definition.  SizeUnit.KILOBYTE should use 1000 as the multiplier, while (the currently missing) SizeUnit.KIBIBYTE should use 1024 as the multipler. Once these additional SizeUnit values are defined, they need to be used on the proper suffixes in Size.java.  See this (10 year) old post by Jeff Atwood for a more complete picture of the differences: https://blog.codinghorror.com/gigabyte-decimal-vs-binary/. Please don't listen to the negative attitude of this article - it's 10 years old.

In particular when issuing a POST request, there is the attribute ""org.glassfish.jersey.media.multipart.FormDataMultiPart"" in the ServletRequest. Moreover, if one calls the method getFields() to iterate over the various FormDataBodyPart of the request it is possible to call getName() on any FormDataBodyPart.   To do so I am using the following request:  ``` FormDataMultiPart multiPartRequest = (FormDataMultiPart) request.getAttribute(""org.glassfish.jersey.media.multipart.FormDataMultiPart"");              Map> fields = multiPartRequest.getFields();             for (String key:fields.keySet()){                 System.out.println(key);                                  for(FormDataBodyPart pname : fields.get(key)){                     System.out.println(pname.getName());                     System.out.println(pname.getValue());                 } ```  However, when calling the method getValue() on any FormDataBodyPart the following exception occurs:  ``` java.lang.IllegalStateException: No multipart config for servlet org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request.getParts(Request.java:2331) org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request.getParts(Request.java:2319) ``` This is even more strange, as there is no field of type binary in the request.

We have logged several requests to the project to uplift, but due to it being inactive we haven't heard from it since (Actually the only commits made to the repo were several that made into one release). Since this is a small project dedicated for supporting jade template for view rendering, which is similar to what dropwizard have onboard for mustache and freemarker, would it make sense for you guys to take this OSS jade project in.

Is there any interest in this feature? Or is this ability already present and I am just missing something?   The rationale for the request is that on my project we have a number of collaborating microservices, and it would be desirable to reduce the number of network requests that are made by specifying the appropriate HTTP cache headers on each response and having the clients cache the data for the specified period.

This would reduce to code overhead of many classes a lot without adding any dependencies to dropwizard directly. Because dropwizard requires a current version of Java the build process would not change much if at all. The process could be a gradual one that changes one class after another, replacing Setters and Getters.  The only downside I see is that users need to understand lombok to understand the dropwizard code. On the other hand the maven build could be changed to delombok the sources and use those for the packed sources.  If this is desirable for the Dropwizard project I would be willing to work on this.","closed","","manuel-hegner","2017-02-01T15:21:14Z","2017-02-01T15:30:05Z"

"","2140","Add alternative to ValidationMethod","Hey, I would like to propose an alternative to the somewhat clunky ValidationMethod included in dropwizard. If this discussion leads to something I would also be willing to implement this new feature.  My proposal is to enable more detailed annotations by allowing users to use validationMethods that look like this: ```java     @NewValidationMethod     public void validateSomething(ConstraintValidatorContext context) {} ``` This would allow users a better control over the validation (e.g. better messages and multiple violations in one method) and would no longer interfere with Jackson (requiring no @JsonIgnore).  To make this work every Class that has this kind of validation methods would need to be annotated with a new @HasAnnotationMethods annotation, which would be a real hibernate constraint and would find every new-type validation method and execute them.  A caveat that I see is performance (on the other hand hibernate validation performance is not great as it is). To not use slow reflection access, code generation would be the better alternative. Does dropwizard already use a library for that? I would not like adding new dependencies just for this feature.

"","1998","Update to Hibernate 5.2.10","Hello, I just switched to DW 1.1.0 (from 1.0.6) and immediately found a problem with the new Hibernate (5.2.8). It is described pretty good here: https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11496  It seems, I am experiencing the same thing. I have two entities: Club and Tenant Club: ``` @Entity public class Club {   @Id   @GeneratedValue   private Integer id;    @Column(nullable = false)   private String name;    @OneToOne   @JoinColumn(name = ""tenant_id"")   private Tenant tenant; ... } ``` and Tenant: ``` @Entity public class Tenant {   @Id   @GeneratedValue   private Integer id;    @OneToOne(mappedBy = ""tenant"", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)   private Club club; ... } ```  Well, basically, constructing these entities I followed the official Hibernate User Guide. Everything worked fine in DW 1.0.6 (and HIbernate 5.1.0 respectively) but after switching I noticed exceptions reporting about ConstraintViolations. I checked the logs, debugged and saw that Hibernate tries to insert a `Club` first, however, it should  insert it only after `Tenant`.  Writing a test for this would be pretty time consuming task. If you really need this - I might try.  Have you experiences anything like this?","closed","","yateam","2017-04-09T00:21:53Z","2017-04-27T12:37:43Z"

I create a JerseyClient and bind it to hk2 via:  ``` final Client client = new JerseyClientBuilder(environment)     .using(configuration.getJerseyClientConfiguration())     .build(smartMobileApplication.getName()); bind(client).to(Client.class); ```  Eventually I perform some async calls:  ```     client.target(""http://example"")                 .path(""/example"")                 .register(HttpAuthenticationFeature.basic(                         configurationCredentials.getLogin(),                         configurationCredentials.getPass()                 ))                 .request()                 .async()                 .post(Entity.entity(entity.getPayload(), MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON), callback);     } ```  After some calls the Executor service is shutdown by hk2 leading to a `RejectedExecutionException`.

I assume that the ""register"" call will alter the underlying `ClientConfig`, which leads to a copy from the jersey runtime (i believe they have a copy on write). The jersey runtime will cleanup these copys and the `DropwizardExecutorProvider` will shutdown. In the javadoc for the `DropwizardExecutorProvider` it is stated that the `DropwizardExecutorProvider` should not be shared. However, if think it is pretty intransparent that the `DropwizardExecutorProvider` is shared just by adding a `register` call to the `WebTarget`.  I am pretty new to dropwizard and java in general.

I'm running several instances of a same dropwizard project behind a load balancer, and all of them report to the same graphite host. Since all of the instances have the same config all the metrics go to graphite with the same prefix, so it gets impossible to have metrics per individual instance. I worked around this issue adding a command-line option like this in the init scirpt:  > -Ddw.metrics.reporters[0].prefix=common.prefix.for.my.app.`hostname`  I.E. using the back-ticks to add the output of the shell command ""hostname"" to the prefix for the graphite metrics. This way I get the name of the machine on the metrics and I can inspect them individually if I need to do so.  I really prefer to control this from the application config rather than the init script.

"","1563","Enhancement to Lifecycle Setup Classes","Greetings,  I noticed that the executor service factories provided in LifecycleEnvironment do not allow you to specify a ThreadFactory directory; instead you must invoke ""threadFactory"" on the returned builder object. However, the builder creates a default thread factory in its constructor which is waste of time and resources if the code has a ThreadFactory implementation it wants to use instead of your defaults.  I've forked your codebase and created the simplest patch possible to create the functionality I am asking for (which is to specify the thread factory up front to save startup time). This simply adds a constructor the executor builders that allows specifying a ThreadFactory (the existing constructors invoke these new constructors) and exposes this via two new factory methods in LifecycleEnvironment.  Ideally, the thread factory should only be created on the invocation of ""build"" but this requires a bit of work and may change the behavior for existing users who reuse builders. As such, I opted for the light touch approach specified above. - isaki-x","closed","improvement,","isaki","2016-05-26T20:42:19Z","2016-05-30T09:48:52Z"
"","2056","JDBI: Extending DBI/DBIFactory","Greetings,  I am experimenting with extending DBIFactory to inject custom argument and column mapper factories into a custom IDBI object (which currently extends DBI, but I could just as easily use a decorator pattern). I've run into two issues (and I only need to solve one of them).  1) DBIFactory returns DBI instead of IDBI 2) DBIFactory invokes the DBI constructor with no way to intercept and inject my own version.  I can create one or more of the following patches to address this:  **Change DBIFactory to return IDBI (Problem 1)**  This will break existing code for users of dropwizard-jdbi. As such, I don't really like this idea. Also, it would remove the visibility of the registration methods for column mappers and arguments, which isn't ideal. As a result, I think this idea is a non-starter. I put it out there as it could solve my issue in a non-optimal way.  **Allow custom DBI instance creation into DBIFactory (Problem 2)**  There are two ways we can do this. If we want to be traditional, we could set up a protected method (createDBI) that could be overridden by child classes and defaults to ""new DBI()"".  If we want to go with a more Java 8-esque approach, I could add a new constructor to DBIFactory that takes a Supplier for generating new DBI instances. The current constructor would be updated to provide a default supplier. Then, the build method could just invoke ""get"" on the supplier to create new DBI instances and then operate on them as it currently does.  Please let me know your thoughts on this and I will create a patch and submit a pull request if any of this works for you. I'm open to alternatives as well; worst case I end up writing my own factory that decorates DBIFactory and returns my own IDBI implementation and updating the handful of places I reference DBIFactory to use my own object instead. I don't necessarily like this approach as I prefer to subclass DBI instead of decorating it.  Thank you!","closed","","isaki","2017-05-11T17:02:24Z","2018-06-27T20:34:36Z"

"","2055","Cannot cancel asynchronous requests by Jersey Client","From what I've digged, this is most likely due to Jersey Client's capabilities. But I figured it may be good to document here as well.  ```     Future future = client.target(         ""https://test.server.com/action"")          .async()         .post(Entity.json(object));      future.cancel(true); ```  I can think of three expected results depending on the state of the request: - Interrupt connection (but somehow not kill if it's keepAlive) and the HTTP request, so the server receives an half-baked HTTP request. Or kill the connection altogether. (Not sure if Apache HTTP client supports this atm) - If the connection is made and the request is already being transmitted, let it finish. If not, do not even proceed. This can be the case when the client is waiting to lease connection from the connection pool. And it's possible by `CloseableHttpResponse.abort()` with dropwizard's Apache HTTP client configuration. - Let everything (connection lease, generate and transmit HTTP request, read response) proceed, but cancel the `Future` object as well as parsing the response. `Future.get()` will return immediately. I believe this is the case at the moment.  **What I've tested:** - Set `'maxConnectionsPerRoute': 1` - Prepare an endpoint that returns result in 10 seconds. - Make 6 requests at the same time, and then cancel them 1 second later.  **Result:** - All futures were cancelled immediately. - All InvocationCallback objects triggered `failed` method with CancelException. - All 6 requests arrived to endpoint with 10 seconds in between each of them.  **What I'd like:** - First request abruptly interrupted from the endpoint perspective. (Optional, for my case) - Other 5 requests never even reached to endpoint.   **My context:** The order of the requests is important for one of our use cases. Due to some reliability issues, we have `retries` enabled in client configuration. `'maxConnectionsPerRoute': 1` is also for the same reason. What happens is that, in some occasions, there are subsequent requests which are ordered fine. But sometimes, the first attempt of the first request fails and it attempts to retry and ends up at the end of the queue of the connection pool; hence pushing the outdated version of the request in the end. I wanted to avoid this by cancelling the old request but encountered this issue.   **What I've digged from the code:** `DropwizardApacheConnector` class generates `HttpUriRequest` variable (originally  from Jersey's `ClientRequest` object. The `HttpUriRequest` variable is originally `RequestBuilder.InternalEntityEclosingRequest` object and has `abort()` method which should accomplish what I need. Unfortunately, that's not enough as Jersey client doesn't provide a way to tie the `Future` object it returns to `DropwizardApacheConnector`; otherwise this would have been a pull request. There is only `AsyncConnectorCallback` object passed by Jersey but it's very limited.  May be related but it's very old: https://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2162","closed","stale,","natnan","2017-05-11T15:28:19Z","2019-08-19T16:00:36Z"
"","2455","Dropwizard sessions leak memory","From what I have gathered, the recommended way to support sessions in Dropwizard is to add a `SessionHandler()` to the environment:  ```java environment.servlets().setSessionHandler(new SessionHandler()); ```  This however, leads to a memory leak with `org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.SessionData` objects not being cleaned up. I have set the max inactive interval and session cache eviction policy to `SessionCache.EVICT_ON_INACTIVITY`, which means that session should expire after 1s of inactivity. Profiling the live objects on the heap in jmap show the following, after repeated `curl` requests to the server:  ```console num   #instances      #bytes  class name ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 31:         1315      126240  org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.SessionData 43:         1315       63120  org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.Session 44:         1315       63120  org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.Session$SessionInactivityTimeout ```  These session objects are never cleaned up and eventually lead to an OOM.  After a little bit of investigation, the issue seems to be coming from https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-jetty/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jetty/ContextRoutingHandler.java#L18 The class extends `AbstractHandler` instead of `AbstractHandlerContainer` (and doesn't override https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/AbstractHandlerContainer.java#L74). This is necessary for the session cleanup, because the children `SessionHandler` for all contexts need to be discovered by the jetty server.  The cleanup is triggered by jetty hosuekeeper's call to `scavenge()` in the `SessionHandler()` - https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionHandler.java#L1276 - https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionIdManager.java#L472 - https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionIdManager.java#L525  The call to `_server.getChildHandlersByClass(SessionHandler.class);` returns an empty list because when examining the chain of handlers, `ContextRoutingHandler` hides the fact that it contains `MutableServletContextHandler` because it doesn't expose its children handlers correctly.  I think the solution would be to have `ContextRoutingHandler` extend `AbstractHandlerContainer` and override `expandChildren(...)`, but I will defer to the maintainers, who will probably understand this better!  --- Update: It seems that more than just the session data contains a memory leak - there is a also a leak with the `SSLSessionImpl`, which shows in jmap:  ```console num   #instances      #bytes  class name -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  6:       188528    19661252  sun.security.ssl.SSLSessionImpl 28:       188528     3095728  sun.security.ssl.SSLSessionId ```","closed","needs code,","dannyqiu","2018-08-14T18:54:15Z","2018-08-23T00:12:49Z"

"","1811","Need finer-grain control of exception behaviour in view renderers","For background details, please refer to the following user group thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dropwizard-user/wy8ksKjz-HA  This issue is a feature request to enable finer-grain control over exceptions thrown when rendering views, so that one can use custom `ExceptionHandler`s to handle certain exception flows.  For example, when using Mustache a `MustacheNotFoundException` is thrown by the Mustache Java API when the template is not found. It is then wrapped/re-thrown as a `RuntimeException` by `MustacheViewRenderer`, which finally gets caught and re-thrown as a `WebApplicationException` with a generic ""template error"" response. The exception handler logic would ultimately catch this `WebApplicationException` will simply return the enclosed `Response` instead of filtering further. What I would like to be able to do is to somehow use an `ExceptionHandler` to catch a wrapped exception and inspect the cause which is the view implementation-specific exceptions (Mustache, Fremarker, etc.) In my case, I want to create a 404 error response with custom page instead of the generic 500 error response.  It achieve this, one can perhaps add a config option which `ViewMessageBodyWriter` uses to determine if the re-thrown `WebApplicationException` should include a `Response` or the caught exception in the cause. Then I have a choice to drill down into the exception causes and decide what to do with it in my custom `ExceptionHandler`. (But of course, this will not be view renderer agnostic by my own choice, as I am handling renderer-specific exceptions manually.)  Please let me know if more info is needed, otherwise I appreciate that you consider this as a feature request.","closed","","acwwat","2016-11-09T22:35:32Z","2016-11-18T08:53:01Z"

If you call the problematic method it will run twice.  Here is a resource definition from the above sample project:  ```Java @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) @Path(""/validated"") public class ValidatedResource {     private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ValidatedResource.class);      @GET     @Path(""/foo"")     @Valid     public Foo getFoo() {         logger.info(""######################### GET FOO"");         return new Foo(""bloop"");     }      @GET     @Path(""/bar"")     public Bar getBar() {         logger.info(""######################### GET BAR"");         return new Bar(27);     } } ```  If you do a `curl localhost:8080/validated/foo` and look at the logs from the Java server, you will see:  ``` INFO  [2017-04-12 22:13:59,083] com.campspot.resources.ValidatedResource: ######################### GET FOO INFO  [2017-04-12 22:13:59,086] com.campspot.resources.ValidatedResource: ######################### GET FOO 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [12/Apr/2017:22:13:59 +0000] ""GET /validated/foo HTTP/1.1"" 200 16 ""-"" ""curl/7.51.0"" 64 ```  And if you do `curl localhost:8080/validated/bar` you will see:  ``` INFO  [2017-04-12 22:14:02,676] com.campspot.resources.ValidatedResource: ######################### GET FOO INFO  [2017-04-12 22:14:02,677] com.campspot.resources.ValidatedResource: ######################### GET BAR 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [12/Apr/2017:22:14:02 +0000] ""GET /validated/bar HTTP/1.1"" 200 13 ""-"" ""curl/7.51.0"" 9 ```  This seems like undesirable behavior.   As a workaround, you can do any of the following:  - rename `getFoo` to a non bean name e.g. `fetchFoo`  - Remove the `@Valid` annotation  - Add an argument to the `getFoo` method (like a query param)","closed","","scottaj","2017-04-12T23:37:30Z","2017-04-18T13:33:49Z"

"","1658","Dropwizard could not log INFO log to console and log file at very early stage of application initialization","Dropwizard could not log INFO log to console and log file at very early stage of application initialization.   My dropwizard application implemented a StrSubstitutor and configured it in the initialize method  ``` @Override   public void initialize(Bootstrap bootstrap)   {     // Enable variable substitution with environment variables     bootstrap.setConfigurationSourceProvider(         new SubstitutingSourceProvider(             bootstrap.getConfigurationSourceProvider(),             new AppPropertySubstitutor(false)         )     );   } ```  The AppPropertySubstitutor depends on a component which uses apache common logging. All INFO level log is not written to the console and the log file in the depended component.  Have checked that jcl-over-slf4j.jar is successfully packaged into the application jar.  The cause is that the default constructor of the dropwizard Application calls    ``` BootstrapLogging.bootstrap() ```  The default logger initialized a ThresholdFilter with log level Level.WARN, thus INFO log is denied.  As the BootstrapLogging.bootstrap() can only be called once.

"","2370","Validation of the application resource model has failed during application initialization","Dropwizard 1.3.2 JDK 10  So I am trying to enable JWT auth on my test service following the documentation and I get the error bellow when I have for example this endpoint set up   ```    @Path(""/boo"")     @POST     public Response foo(@Auth Identity identity,                                     @Valid Payload payload                                     ) {         return Response.ok().entity(""Auth endpoint"").build();     } ```  if I set it up this way, so basically I removed the `@Valid  Payload payload` everything works server starts and jwt validation works on this endpoint, but  if it is set the payload validation then I get the error  ```     @Path(""/boo"")     @POST     public Response foo(@Auth Identity identity) {         return Response.ok().entity(""Auth endpoint"").build();     } ```  if I use a `GET` endpoint looks it also works fine for example:   ```     @Path(""/boo"")     @GET     public Response foo(@Auth Identity identity,                                        @Valid @BeanParam Payload payload) {         return Response.ok().entity(""Auth endpoint"").build();     } ```  I might be doing something wrong, will appreciate some help if possible, thanks!    ```  org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.ModelValidationException: Validation of the application resource model has failed during application initialization.

The dropwizard metrics like Guage, Timers etc should support even timestamp as one of the members (Timestamp should be an optional member). Let me know any comments.  Example use case is: suppose say, we want to run a validation after an event has occurred and send the validation result as guage value once the validation completes. Now, in this scenario, the event will any ways be sent as metric (no need of timestamp here) but, while sending the validation result, it makes more sence to include the timestamp at which the event has occurred. This will help in correlating the validation metric with the event metric.  Let me know comments. If not, I can contribute to include timestamp as a member to Metric family specially for guage. Timestamp can be an optional member to the metric type.","closed","","db-vmw","2018-03-30T05:48:52Z","2018-03-30T07:49:46Z"

"","1768","Bind default exception mappers","Currently when a user wants to override one of the default exception mappers they must specify `registerDefaultExceptionMappers: false` in their configuration, register their exception mapper, and then re-register all the other default exception mappers they want. This is not user friendly. A user should be able to register their own exception mapper, override the default exception mapper while preserving other default exception mappers.  It should be possible to achieve this behavior as alluded to in [JERSEY-2722](https://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2722)  > your own ExceptionMapper should always have a higher priority than anything provided by Jersey  and alluded in [Jersey's Bean Validation code](https://github.com/jersey/jersey/blob/1a7919181d8a1f550c7fc20898db67fe9da5d596/ext/bean-validation/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/server/validation/internal/ValidationBinder.java#L102)  ``` java // Custom Exception Mapper and Writer - registering in binder to make possible for users register their own providers. bind(ValidationExceptionMapper.class).to(ExceptionMapper.class).in(Singleton.class); bind(ValidationErrorMessageBodyWriter.class).to(MessageBodyWriter.class).in(Singleton.class); ```  This pull request takes a crack at introducing this to Dropwizard, while remaining 100% backwards compatible. I've tried creating this behavior before in #1144, but it didn't work out, so I'd appreciate some help testing this :smile:. I believe it is working as I have an app that has:  ``` java @Override public void run(final DropwizardSampleConfiguration configuration,                 final Environment environment) {     environment.jersey().register(new Resource());     environment.jersey().register(new MyJerseyException()); }   public class MyJerseyException implements ExceptionMapper {     @Override     public Response toResponse(JerseyViolationException e) {         return Response.ok(""Oh yeah"").build();     } } ```  and I receive the ""Oh yeah"" response with every restart and request (100 requests across 10 restarts).  We can even keep around the `registerDefaultExceptionMappers` for users who want no default exception mappers registered, but I'm assuming most users will not use this option and opt for overriding specific exception mappers.  The major benefit to this approach is the ability to add new exception mappers without having the relatively large cost of forcing the user to know them all 😋   TODO: - [x] Add tests - [x] Update docs - [x] To use the provider annotation or not?","closed","improvement,","nickbabcock","2016-10-07T20:52:37Z","2016-10-11T23:30:05Z"

What I am proposing would be to expand the `EndpointLogger` to also look through `ResourceConfig.getResources()` to catch all that were not found using `DropwizardResourceConfig.allClasses()`.  Specifically it logs the child resources that were grouped using a manually created Resource object to share a common prefix, for example.","closed","","vemilyus","2016-11-07T16:27:35Z","2016-11-09T18:00:19Z"

"","1959","Support `@UnitOfWork` in sub-resources","Currently Dropwizard doesn't open transactions in sub-resources as reported in #1806. The problem is that Dropwizard scans resource methods for `@UnitOfWork` during resource initialization and sub-resource methods are not resolved at that time and can't be registered by Dropwizard. The fix is to defer the lookup of the `@UnitOfWork` annotation on a method until it's invoked and than cache it. One downside of this approache is that `ConcurrentMap` doesn't support null values, so we have to use `Optional` from `UnitOfWork` which can add an additional overhead, but it should be negligible.","closed","improvement,","arteam","2017-03-13T08:55:10Z","2017-03-14T18:05:35Z"

Since `Authorizer::authorize` doesn't have a `throws` clause, I've only handled `UncheckedExecutionException`s.  Result when `null` is returned by the authorizer will differ from previously, where a `NullPointerException` would have been thrown by the cache's `put` method, whereas now a `InvalidCacheLoadException` will be thrown by the cache itself when the loader returns null. There might be a way to have the same result as previously, let me know if you want me to look into it (but personally I don't think it really matters as most users won't be catching those exceptions anyway, and it might even be clearer as to what happened).

From the implementation side `TcpSocketAppenderFactory` and `UdpSocketAppenderFactory` are both discoverable and work with generic logging events. That means they can be configured in a YAML config file for general and request logging. ```yaml logging:   level: INFO   appenders:     - type: tcp       host: localhost       port: 24562 ```  ```yaml server:   requestLog:     appenders:       - type: tcp         host: localhost         port: 24562 ```  From the reliability side, the appenders extend `ResilientOutputStreamBase`. That means in case if the connections drops because of network glitch or a DNS failure, it will back off and try to reopen a new connection automatically.","closed","feature,","arteam","2018-03-03T17:29:25Z","2018-03-07T12:19:40Z"

This in turn results in increased number of failed connections to DW (connection timeouts) when the server is under stress. This seems to be a regression between 0.9.x. and 1.0.x (because in 0.9.x, somaxconn was not explicitly used as a source of a default value).  The issue seems to be specifically in Files.readAllBytes(paths.get('/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn')), in that the SeekableByteChannel in readAllBytes is treating the /proc fs as a regular file, which it is not (seeks aren't possible, nor filesize can be read ahead).

"","1550","dropwizard-testing: extract a resource testing helper class from ResourceTestRule","`ResourceTestRule` is an excellent and easy way to test resources in Dropwizard, but sometimes JUnit rules aren't as convenient or flexible as ""normal"" helper classes might be in tests.  For example, I wanted most of the semantics of `ResourceTestRule`, but I wanted each test in the class to have a slightly different configuration. This is kind of a problem when using `ResourceTestRule` as you're basically ""locked in"" to the configuration passed to its constructor for entire test case/class.  I've got a rough implementation over in https://github.com/thomaslee/dropwizard/tree/tom_rsrc_test_helper but am opening this ticket for discussion (shame on me for starting on the patch before reading the guidelines for contributing).  The strategy taken is: 1. Extract `ResourceTestHelper` from `ResourceTestRule`. 2. Reimplement `ResourceTestRule` using the new `ResourceTestHelper` class. 3. Now `dropwizard-testing` users can choose the class most appropriate to their test(s).

EDIT:  I've discovered a ""workaround"", which involves hardwiring BouncyCastle as a higher priority provider to the Sun JCE.  Whilst this works, it immediately imposes the performance penalty of using BouncyCastle where optimised AES is better in the SunJCE.  Whilst it could be possible to go to every location and specify the provider by name, I believe the better solution is to offer the truststore/keytore provider option for the dropwizard tls client.","closed","bug,","nheitz","2018-05-23T16:54:18Z","2018-06-26T08:58:43Z"

In the Javadoc it states  > Note that this feature only pertains to _authentication_. To enable authorization, use `AuthDynamicFeature`.  This sounds like the author would like us to use the `PolymorphicAuthDynamicFeature` in concert _with_ `AuthDynamicFeature`. This doesn't really make much sense. The `AuthDynamicFeature` registers a filter that handles both authentication _and_ authorization. It is not used _only_ for authorization. Using both features would end up registering the filters twice, and having them called twice.   And also how are we expected to register `AuthDynamicFeature`. Say we have two filters for polymorphic feature  ``` final BasicCredentialAuthFilter filterOne = new BasicCredentialAuthFilter.Builder()         .setAuthenticator(authenticatorOne)         .buildAuthFilter();  final BasicCredentialAuthFilter filterTwo = new BasicCredentialAuthFilter.Builder()         .setAuthenticator(authenticatorTwo)         .buildAuthFilter();  register(new PolymorphicAuthDynamicFeature<>(ImmutableMap.of(          PrincipalOne.class, filterOne,          PrincipalTwo.class, filterTwo ))); ```  What do we do now with the `AuthDynamicFeature`? It only takes one filter. Are we supposed to register _two_ `AuthDynamicFeature`s? There's isn't any documentation on intended usage.   @evnm It looks like you were the author of this. Did you have an intended usage for this being used along side authorization, or did your javadoc comment mean that if you need authorization don't use this, instead use the other auth feature?  With the current implementation of the `PolymorphicAuthDynamicFeature`, was there something stopping you from simply using the same registration algorithm used in the `AuthDymamicFeature`, where the filter registration handle both authentication and authorization.  Without testing anything out, it seems to me that we _can_ use the poly feature for both authentication and authorization. We just need to use the same registration algo used in the `AuthDynamicFeature`. I'll check out the possibility later, but I'd like to hear what @evnm has to say. Maybe I am missing something.","closed","","psamsotha","2016-07-12T08:20:52Z","2016-07-15T00:13:53Z"

"","1604","Hibernate insert/update exceptions not being returned to the client","**Version: 1.0.0RC3**  The fix to allow lazy loading of POJOs during serialization has introduced a key issue. We are no longer seeing SQLExceptions during an insert/update//delete being reported back to the client.  In 1.0.0RC3, the session will be closed and the transaction committed only after the serialization has happened. If there are any database exceptions during the transaction commit (column val exceed/constraints etc..), they now happen only after the serialized response has been sent back. So the client assumes things are fine, but actually the server logs show the exception.  I guess we will still need to end the transaction or commit it in the RESP_FILTERS_START event. And session can be closed in FINISHED event.

"","1745","@UnwrapValidatedValue is required for all *Param resource parameters","**The Issue**  Since the upgrade to Hibernate 5.x in dropwizard 1.0 the following code now fails at runtime:  ``` java @GET @Path(""/long"") public Response receiveLong(@NotNull @QueryParam(""long"") LongParam longParam) {     return Response.ok().build(); } ```  Hitting this endpoint with a null value causes the following runtime exception:  `HV000186: The constraint of type 'javax.validation.constraints.NotNull' defined on 'receiveLong.query param long' has multiple matching constraint validators which is due to an additional value handler of type 'io.dropwizard.jersey.validation.ParamValidatorUnwrapper'. It is unclear which value needs validating. Clarify configuration via @UnwrapValidatedValue.`  This happens because Hibernate Validator doesn't know if you want to apply `@NotNull` to `longParam` or the value inside of `LongParam`, since dropwizard has provided an unwrapper for that type. To fix this, you have to use `@UnwrapValidatedValue` to tell Hibernate Validator to which value the validation should be applied:  ``` java @GET @Path(""/long"") public Response receiveLong(@UnwrapValidatedValue @NotNull @QueryParam(""long"") LongParam longParam) {     return Response.ok().build(); } ```  In practice this means that you have to add this annotation to every `*Param` you use that also is required. This is required, but unnecessary, because you really **always** want the `@NotNull` to apply to the `LongParam` and not the value inside, because the `*Param` classes will throw the right validation exceptions if the value is null.  **Our Solution**  This was a breaking change for us when upgrading dropwizard from 0.8.x to 1.0, as we use the `*Param` classes a lot. Putting `@UnwrapValidatedValue` on every parameter felt very verbose and made things harder to read.  We added 2 things: 1. A maven plugin that scans for parameters not annotated post-compilation and adds the annotations using javaassist if they are missing. 2. A startup check to ensure every usage of `*Param` includes this annotation and fails if not. This at least prevents starting up with something that will fail at runtime.  I would be happy to submit this as a PR, but I have a few concerns. 1. The use of a maven plugin + javaassist is a little hacky. It's worked great for us, but feels like not the best solution. 2. [@UnwrapValidatedValue](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/api/org/hibernate/validator/valuehandling/UnwrapValidatedValue.html) is marked as experiemental, and unclear if this is something we should be handling like this long-term 3. The right solution is probably to add to Hibernate Validator a way to set a default for the unwrapping behavior for specific classes. So in this case, default to `unwrap=false` for all *Param classes. This is not possible today.","closed","blocked,","cmicali","2016-09-27T14:01:34Z","2018-06-24T22:16:25Z"

"","1645","Fix a test(-only) problem to work with both Jackson 2.7 and 2.8","(for background, see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1311 on Jackson side)  So: there is a small problem with couple of tests cases, leading to test failures with Jackson 2.8, but not earlier versions, as earlier versions did not check type assignments wrt `defaultImpl` of `@JsonTypeInfo` annotation.  Problem here is that some tests explicitly ask for binding to `SimpleServerFactory` (instead of base type `ServerFactory`); but as per annotations in `ServerFactory`, default implementation is `DefaultServerFactory`. Since `DefaultServerFactory` is NOT a subtype of `SimpleServerFactory` (but only `ServerFactory`), such a request could return an instance of `DefaultServerFactory` and result in a class cast exception. Because of this, Jackson's type handling code throws exception instead.  It is possible that some improvements would make sense on Jackson side (for example, improved error messaging if and as possible); but on short term it would make sense to ensure that test failure is prevented since as far as I can see, this is test-only problem and normal running of a DropWizard service would not hit the same problem. Conversely if there are other problems for actual code, it'd be necessary to get a good reproduction of such usage: I don't think test case as-is reproduces real problem.  So: this patch should remove 5 test failures related to using Jackson 2.8.1 with DW. (I will try to work on other remaining problems that relate to exception message checking next)","closed","","cowtowncoder","2016-07-26T05:57:53Z","2016-07-26T07:15:47Z"

In some projects, this is a requirement and we can't refactor the code to use only one. We found that in the current code we are able to register multiple Hibernate bundles but we can only use one at a time (With the `@UnitOfWork` annotation). This PR is to add the ability to use more than one bundle in the same `@UnitOfWork` context.  ###### Solution: We changed the `@UnitOfWork` annotation to accept multiple values for the bundle name. Also, we changed the `UnitOfWorkAspect` to process all the selected bundles (instead of processing only one) in the same way as before. So when we perform any operation in the aspect we execute it in all the selected bundles.   This allows us to see all the selected bundles as a group in the way that if an error occurs and the transaction needs to be reverted they are going to be rollbacked in all the selected bundles, the same happens with the commit and clean operations.  ###### Result: The result is that we can select multiple bundles in the same `@UnitOfWork` by passing the values as follow:  `@UnitOfWork(value={'bundle1', 'bundle2'})` or just `@UnitOfWork({'bundle1', 'bundle2'})`  The change is totally retro-compatible and we can specify only one bundle by:  `@UnitOfWork('bundle')` or use the default one (if we only register one bundle) by not passing any value. `@UnitOfWork`  The rest of the system will remain exactly the same and also the use of Hibernate will not change at all.","closed","stale,","damagode","2018-05-18T16:41:44Z","2019-12-01T00:09:18Z"

"","2428","Seperate readonly session","###### Problem: Our company uses dropwizard with hibernate, but our production database is actually a cluster with a write master and read replicas. We want our dropwizard app to be able to connect to either the master or the replicas on a per-request basis depending on the endpoint.  Someone from our company previously opened #2248 which was basically a version of the internal fork of dropwizard hibernate we maintain, and works by decoupling the DAO from a specific session factory.  After some changes we've made internally, we realized the problem with that approach is that it breaks an existing workflow that allows you to have multiple datasources in your app for totally different databases, and have different DAOs connect to those.   ###### Solution: This is a second attempt to solve the problem stated above with a different approach. Instead of decoupling the DAO from the session factory, we replace the session factory provided to DAOs with a Dropwizard class that can hold two different connections, one to a write master and one to a read replica. That class also has a `ThreadLocal` that is set based on the `readOnly` property on the `UnitOfWork`, and if it is true, returns the reader connection.   This is all configured at the datasource configuration level, where `PooledDataSourceFactory` now has an optional parameter for a read only URL. If that property is specified, two managed data sources will be created instead of one, and the second will be connected to the read URL.  ###### Result: For projects using dropwizard-hibernate, you can now specify a `readOnlyUrl` property on your database configuration, and add `readOnly=true` to the `UnitOfWork` annotations on your endpoints to have those endpoints hit a read replica connection you specify.   If you do not specify a `readOnlyUrl`, it will only make one connection and use that regardless of the `readOnly` setting (as it does currently). So there should be no performance or resource overhead added if you do not use this feature.  Unfortunately, this is a breaking change, because the signature of `AbstractDAO` has changed to take in a different class. The migration should be pretty easy for most projects, unless they are manually doing something with the hibernate session factory that used to get passed in there. I could not think of a way to accomplish this change without changing the AbstractDAO.  Other changes:  Since I changed the base database configuration that is shared by hibernate, liquibase, and JDBI, I also made some minor changes to the latter two integrations.  *Liquibase:* No real change, but always uses the write connection and never a read one you specify.  *JDBI and JDBI3:* Added a `buildReadOnly` method to both factory classes that will build a instance using the `readOnlyUrl` if it exists.","closed","stale,","scottaj","2018-07-10T23:32:13Z","2021-03-23T22:43:06Z"

In fact, the logging of configuration values for included / excluded, protocols / cipher suites also doesn't fit with the rest of Dropwizard (ie, we don't log configuration values for other classes)  ###### Solution: Log only the protocols and cipher suites that Jetty will expose. And log the protocols and cipher suites that Jetty will reject (though it could expose them if configured to do so).  This will make a clean break from the previous https configuration logging by adopting Jetty's logic for determining what protocols and cipher suites are included vs excluded (code comments contain link to Jetty's implementation)  ###### Result: Dropwizard https apps will print the following by default:  ``` INFO HttpsConnectorFactory: Enabled protocols: [TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2] INFO HttpsConnectorFactory: Disabled protocols: [SSLv2Hello, SSLv3] ```  And if someone excludes TLSv1 in their config, it will move from enabled to disabled  Side note, even though Jetty will expose TLSv1 and TLSv1.1, the cipher suites compatible with them eliminate 99% of clients so TLSv1.2 is seemingly the only available protocol (a follow-up discussion that I have planned)","closed","feature,","nickbabcock","2018-06-22T22:17:27Z","2018-06-23T11:14:03Z"

The JSON access logs introduced in #2232 default[3] to request URI. While it could be argued that a different output format doesn't have to remain passive to the previous layout. It did take a bit to trace down the issue as I assumed switching the format would produce logs with the same composite parts. What this change between uri/url intentional?  ###### Design:  Been thinking about this quite a bit more trying to reason about the differences between uri/url. It isn't very clear from the [spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3) if there is a canonical name for the path+query part. The current dropwizard namings seem misleading according to spec, not sure if it was intended to align or if it carried over the logback naming conventions. [Logback](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/v_1.2.3/logback-access/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/access/spi/AccessEvent.java#L147) appears to mostly align with [javax.servlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getRequestURI--).  ```          foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose          \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/           |           |            |            |        |        scheme     authority       path        query   fragment           |   _____________________|__          / \ /                        \          urn:example:animal:ferret:nose ```  p.s. sorry for the bikeshedding...  ###### Solution: Introduce `pathQuery` attribute that includes the path/query segments as defined in RFC3986.

My personal auto-cleanup setup is too aggressive for DropWizard coding conventions and touched too much code (like marking nearly every parameter in a method declaration final). I experimented briefly with trying to set something up that was DropWizard specific and was unhappy with the results (it removed all of the unsupported `@SuppressWarnings` declarations even with the least aggressive setup). As such, by hand was the only way I could ensure the bare minimum was changed to meet my goal, which was to eliminate the easiest warnings to fix.  ###### Result: DropWizard now has a little over 150 warnings remaining.

See #2244  ###### Solution: Use the jersey application event hooks so that after jersey has finished initializing the application we can query jersey's (more accurate) state than our own. The result is an implementation that is more accurate and simple (imo).  This does require us to start a jersey instance so that it has a chance to collect all the information, which did cause some modifications to the tests (but not much!). This is technically a breaking change for those dropwizard users who have unit tests using `DropwizardResourceConfig::getEndpointsInfo`, as they'll now see no endpoints logged until jersey is started. I estimate the number of users impacted to be minimal to nil.  I also added an endpoint logging test that asserts the effects of `urlPattern`, as I noticed that is missing in the current implementation.  As consequence of querying jersey's state, we see more endpoints available. Jersey exposes an `OPTIONS` endpoint for all registered resources, which I have decided to filter out to maintain compatibility. If desired, I can include a parameter to log these as well.  `forTesting` in `DropwizardResourceConfig` is now defunct. There may, at one time, been a use for it. But I'm not sure why logging of endpoints would be disabled for tests. Additionally, the comment ""create a subclass to pin it to Throwable"" refers to a bygone era.

(#2234)  ###### Solution: Everytime Jersey requests a new `ConfiguredValidator` we create a new one with the current context:  ```java final ValidatorContext context = factory.usingContext(); context.constraintValidatorFactory(resourceContext.getResource(InjectingConstraintValidatorFactory.class)); return new DropwizardConfiguredValidator(context.getValidator()); ```  And just like that, our constraint validator receive context injections!  Not so fast.  For every request, a validator will need to be newly instantiated with the request context. The issue is that Dropwizard already sends in a fully configured validator that can't be used across multiple requests simultaneously for context injection to work. This required changing the `Environment` and `JerseyClientBuilder` public APIs which I am loathe to do (but had to).  ###### Result: Can use `@Context` inside constraint validators  public APIs that have had their signature changed (breaking changes):  ``` JerseyClientBuilder::using(Validator) -> JerseyClientBuilder::using(ValidatorFactory) Environment::new(..., Validator, ...) -> Environment::new(..., ValidatorFactory, ...) Environment::setValidator(Validator) -> Environment::setValidatorFactory(ValidatorFactory) Resource::setValidator(Validator) -> Resource::setValidatorFactory(ValidatorFactory) ```  To help those who may not care about context injection and just want a validator, I have decided to keep `Environment::getValidator`.

Unfortunately, the handler doesn't strip the original `Content-Length` header from requests, and requests return the content length of compressed content instead of uncompressed. This can create confusing situations for applications that check the length of requests for future processing. A classic example is a reverse proxy handler which parses a request, enriches it, and sends it to an origin server for processing. In this case, the proxy handler will send plain data to the origin server, but with a misleading `Content-Length` header and the origin will reject the request as malformed.  ###### Solution: A solution is to strip the `Content-Length` header from the request and override the `getContentLength` method of `HttpServletRequest` to specify it as an unknown. In this case the proxy handler will pass the request as chunked to the origin server (albeit without the `Transfer-Encoding` header), and it will be correctly handled. This seems to be a correct behaviour, because we don't know the length of decoded content beforehand.  ###### Result: Transparent handling of compressed HTTP requests in Dropwizard applications.

Only metrics for ""client-A"" were being reported 2. The connection timeout I set for client-A was the same for client-B. This especially confused me because client B's config had a different timeout value.    I realized when `connectorProvider` is not explicitly set in the builder, then it gets silently set on the first build. From then on that builder will use the same `connectorProvider`.   Current solutions to this are: - instantiating a new builder for every client - creating a unique `connectorProvider` for each client.   However, I thought people might want to reuse the same builder without explicitly setting the `connectorProvider`. I'm not sure if this is a worthy change, as the current process may be the desired state. I think you all will know better.    ###### Solution:  When `connectorProvider` is null in the `JerseyClientBuilder`, build will not auto set it.

"","2248","Support dynamic current session to allow separate read and write connections","###### Problem:  I am working on a project which utilizes Dropwizard Hibernate. My current mission is to distribute database operations across two endpoints, one for reads and another for writes. DW Hibernate is great because it provides the UnitOfWork framework which allows for multiple bundles to be configured and for those bundles to be specified on an individual basis by using `UnitOfWork#value`. This accomplishes exactly what I need - I will setup a bundle for reading, a bundle for writing, then on my read-only resources throw a `@UnitOfWork(“read-only”)` and then the resources that require writing `@UnitOfWork(“write”)`.  Currently, UnitOfWorkAspect will determine the appropriate session factory based on the current UnitOfWork (see [UnitOfWork:62](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-hibernate/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/hibernate/UnitOfWorkAspect.java#L62)), which is great. The problem is, the session factory and session are then set privately inside of the aspect and made unavailable to other components. This is particularly a problem inside of [AbstractDAO](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-hibernate/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/hibernate/AbstractDAO.java), where the session factory is required as an instance parameter. This presents limitations in client code outside of Dropwizard, such as in event listeners that perform database operations.  In summary, I propose two things inside of this PR: 1. The context determined inside of UnitOfWorkAspect be made publicly available to other Dropwizard and non-Dropwizard client components 2. AbstractDAO be modified (a breaking change unfortunately) to not require a SessionFactory for construction, and instead use the UnitOfWork context  ###### Solution:  The primary modification includes adding a UnitOfWorkContext class with ThreadLocals to store the context that is determined inside of `UnitOfWorkAspect#beforeStart`. This context is then used to determine the current session AbstractDAO, rather than the injected property that it previously depended on.  ###### Result:  The change to UnitOfWorkAspect alone is non-breaking. It simply makes internal context publicly available. The proposed change for AbstractDAO is, unfortunately, breaking. It will be a potentially tedious change but hopefully not complicated. Clients that are only using one bundle currently (I imagine this is the majority case otherwise this issue would have been hit) will have to update their app configuration, or wherever they instantiate their DAOs, to no longer provide a session factory. In my project we have over 100 DAOs and this was a smooth transition that took about 20 minutes.","closed","improvement,","sam-berry","2018-01-19T15:33:49Z","2018-07-26T16:17:57Z"
