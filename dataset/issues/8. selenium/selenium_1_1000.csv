"","10213","[java] allow setting a different keyboard or pointer for actions on i…","You can see how difficult it is to work with an input device that isn't a default keyboard or a default mouse in the tests I wrote for a pointer.  Using a `setActivePointer()` / `setActiveKeyboard` is one way of making this easier. I was looking at different options like putting it in the constructor, but then you'd need 8 different constructors when we add in wheel support soon.  The Actions class does a good job of adding Pauses where needed for newly seen inputs already, but something does not like 2 different objects being given the same name, so we need to re-use the existing  input object if it is there rather than creating a new one.   The implementation can probably be improved.","closed","","titusfortner","2022-01-01T20:13:05Z","2022-01-10T14:01:07Z"

"","9953","Make `SearchContext.findElements` have a generic return type","Why do this? The main reason is to support frameworks that wish to extend Selenium, but return their own sub-types of `WebElement` from `findBy`.  `findElement` can already be overridden using co-variant return types, but the `List` returned by `findElements` could not be overridden as easily. This signature change allows that.  With this change in place, subclasses of WebDriver can now do something like this, without there being compilation issues:  ``` public interface Special extends WebDriver {     SpecialElement findElement(By locator);     List findElements(By locator); } ```  Compiling the entire java code base suggests that this is a safe change to make -- no tests or other calls sites needed to be modified in order for this change to work.  **Thanks for contributing to Selenium!** **A PR well described will help maintainers to quickly review and merge it**  Before submitting your PR, please check our [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

This PR is set to conveniently show the diff of what exists and what could exist.  ### Options for reviewers:  1. Reject all changes and keep what is in trunk exactly as it is 2. Reject PR but make changes to what is in trunk  3. Accept PR, but make proposed changes 4. Accept PR and/or do nothing and this will get merged before 4.2 is released  ### Currently in Trunk  * I updated the Ruby implementation match the Python implementation approach. * I made the Java & .NET approaches similar (except .NET is using a class with properties, Java is using a class with static methods) * All languages have the same descriptions for each of the parameters * We have tests for the 5 working and 2 failing tests for these 4 languages.  There are legit issues to be taken with the implementation in trunk (especially with .NET since the class with properties isn't ideal). But, it is basic implementation of a `scroll()` method with all the functionality.  ### Changes proposed by this PR  The primary reason for this PR is that I believe it is not intuitive for users to understand the purpose of `x` and `y`, even if we called them `offsetX` and `offsetY`. The idea of offset from origin and the origin being one of two different things took me a while to figure out, and I like to think I'm at least average in figuring out this stuff compared to our users.  This PR removes a generic scroll method and replaces it with 3 convenience methods; the first 2 represent what 98% of use cases require. The 3rd is the featured method but it makes it blatantly obvious that the offsets are explicitly associated with the origin (viewport or element).  The names match the existing language conventions for pointer:  1. Scroll to Element — takes element argument .NET — `ScrollToElement()` Java — `scrollToElement()` Python — `scroll_to_element()` Ruby — `#scroll_to`  2. Scroll by Amount — takes deltaX/deltaY values: .NET — `ScrollByAmount()` Java — `scrollByAmount()` Python — `scroll_by_amount()` Ruby — `#scroll_by`  3. Scroll from an origin — takes deltaX/deltaY and a ScrollOrigin object instance .NET — `ScrollFromOrigin()` Java — `scrollFromOrigin()` Python — `scroll_from_origin()` Ruby — `#scroll_from`  There are a lot of potential (and valid) quibbles with this implementation, from method names to defaults, to where defaults live, to which stage of the actions class process does translations of scroll origin, etc. I tried very hard to make the implementations happen at the same ""place"" in the different languages, but in a language idiomatic way.","closed","C-java,","titusfortner","2022-05-14T20:26:47Z","2022-05-24T23:16:48Z"

"","10761","[py]: Introducing code formatting for a consistent code base","This makes some improvements to the python linting, Moving forward I would like to get the entire code base linted in a consistent manner for ease of maintenance and contributions.  As a proof of concept this pull request contains the following:  - Upgraded github workflow to use a new `tox -e linting` recipe. - `Black` (very common python code formatter) enablement only on `/py/test/*` to prove things out. - `Isort` - Python import automatic sorter and manager - Having `flake8` work in tandem with `black` & `isort` - introduction of a `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file for assisting `git blame` with sweeping changes required in future. - Some tweaks to the tox configurations (and increased the version of tox to latest, was outdated in CI).  Keeping things small and incremental right now to allow things to roll out gradually.  ~I would *much* rather have pre-commit implemented with this - why?~ edit: I know you all hate the idea of pre-commit 😄    - It only applies to staged files with ease  - Integrates into flow automatically on `git commit `, enforcing client side compliance, the argument for not wanting it to get in the way is trivial, `--no-verify` works as normal AND `SKIP=HOOKNAME git commit ` gives individual hook skips!  - Has *tons* more useful hooks for the code base  - Does largely the same thing but better  - Can be locked down to only apply to the python sub directory  - Does not require managing some sort of bash/executable files to move into `.git/hooks` its all implicit  I have kept this over `py/test/` for now, but I would _really_ like to have it fully rolled out, the benefits are fantastic (imo).  Right now as-is the flow is unchanged, what once was `tox -e flake8` should now be run as `tox -e linting` is now much more thorough and automatic at finding and correcting code formatting, this makes at *most* _very_ minor changes to the underlying AST/BC so will not introduce any bugs into the code.  ```console tox -e linting                                                                                                                                 ✔  py 🐍  22:34:53    linting installed: black==22.3.0,click==8.1.3,flake8==4.0.1,importlib-metadata==4.2.0,isort==5.10.1,mccabe==0.6.1,mypy-extensions==0.4.3,pathspec==0.9.0,platformdirs==2.5.2,pycodestyle==2.8.0,pyflakes==2.4.0,tomli==2.0.1,typed-ast==1.5.4,typing_extensions==4.2.0,zipp==3.8.0 linting run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='98988857' linting run-test: commands[0] | flake8 /home/si/workspaces/selenium/py linting run-test: commands[1] | isort /home/si/workspaces/selenium/py/test --profile black linting run-test: commands[2] | black /home/si/workspaces/selenium/py/test -l 120 All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨ 111 files left unchanged. ```","open","C-py,","symonk","2022-06-11T09:04:08Z","2022-07-14T17:15:23Z"

The biggest difference from the other commit is that I didn't touch any of the abandoned commands in `DriverCommand.java` which I think we can dramatically clean up in another commit.  One issue with this is that we did not deprecate `TouchActions.java`. I think the intention was to implement it with w3c compliant methods, but... because it is a subclass, we'd either need to add generics, make a bunch of private methods public, or add these methods to `Actions.java` directly. As it is, this implementation is not usable, so I think it should be removed for now, and we should add the touch actions in the `Actions.java` class directly, which I think we should do with ScrollWheel as well.","closed","C-java,","titusfortner","2022-01-03T21:16:12Z","2022-06-10T11:23:20Z"

Can remove some of the uglier parts of this PR and put more onus on user: ```cs IReadOnlyDictionary logCommands = new Dictionary {     {         DriverCommand.GetAvailableLogTypes,         new HttpCommandInfo(HttpCommandInfo.GetCommand, ""/session/{sessionId}/se/log/types"")     },     {         DriverCommand.GetLog,         new HttpCommandInfo(HttpCommandInfo.PostCommand, ""/session/{sessionId}/se/log"")     } };  var customCommandDriver = driver as ICustomDriverCommandExecutor; customCommandDriver.RegisterCustomDriverCommands(logCommands);  ReadOnlyCollection logTypes = driver.Manage().Logs.AvailableLogTypes; driver.Url = ""https://selenium.dev/selenium/web/errors.html""; driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(""input"")).Click(); ReadOnlyCollection results = driver.Manage().Logs.GetLog(""browser""); ```  The existing code allows driver classes for drivers that haven't implemented the logging endpoints, to call the log methods, but it won't actually send the commands. No error that the method isn't actually doing anything.  This PR would always send the command but will swallow the not-implemented exception if the driver commands were not added. So same end result, but slightly less efficient, but if a user is calling for something that never returns anything anyway, maybe that doesn't matter from an implementation standpoint.  Any feedback from anyone would be great on this, thanks.","closed","C-dotnet,","titusfortner","2022-05-20T05:38:39Z","2022-05-25T02:42:45Z"

This PR changes that, analyses the diff to figure out if any bazel target is affected, and based on the code path, it is decided if the whole workflow will be executed or not.  So, there will be a main workflow (`dispatch-workflows.yml`) that will run on PRs and push to `trunk`, and based on the changeset, it will trigger the desired workflow.  In addition, to avoid corner cases, all workflows are scheduled to be run twice a day. With that, we can catch things that the improved workflow did not catch.  A follow up PR should be created to filter the workflow execution by the affected bazel targets.  **Thanks for contributing to Selenium!** **A PR well described will help maintainers to quickly review and merge it**  Before submitting your PR, please check our [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

"","10312","Fatjar Selenium Java - not working properly","Similar to this issue for Maven https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9907 I found the same problem with Gradle.  Issue 9907 was closed, yet it does not appear to have a resolution?  I would be super grateful to get some guidance on this - in short, the below is the workaround that we use, inspired by issue 9907.  But a more formal solution would be great.  I can put a cut down repo on github, but the below shows the issue, in a fatjar with dependencies this fails.  In Eclipse debugger this works. Is WebDriverManager not playing nicely with Firefox and expecting Chrome?  public static void main(String[] args) { WebDriverManager.firefoxdriver().setup(); try {	       driver = new FirefoxDriver();       }catch(WebDriverException e) { 	log.error(e.toString() , e); 	}	 }  Environment is  Eclipse Version: 2019-12  Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS Gradle Version: 6.0 Java Home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64 id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '6.1.0'     //See https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9907 //In the jar file look for /META-INF/services/org.openqa.selenium.remote.service.DriverService$Builder //in that file replace this line: //org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriverService$Builder //with this line: //org.openqa.selenium.firefox.GeckoDriverService$Builder //let archive manager repack the jar and then execute - works ok then..     I manage to find out where the problem was. It was not a problem with the path.  As you proabably know, at runtime, available driver services (e.g. GeckoDriverService, ChromeDriverService, etc.) are detected based on the content of a file named ""org.openqa.selenium.remote.service.DriverService$Builder"" that is located in the jar under the /META-INF/services/ path. It contains the names of the concrete available driver services.  When I examined the content of this file in my jar it contained only this single line : org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriverService$Builder  So, only the chrome service was available at runtime.  I found 2 ways of fixing it.  1st solution  I added the following file to my project that overrides the default one put in the jar :  Project   |_src/resources/META-INF/sources/org.openqa.selenium.remote.service.DriverService$Builder  With the following content : org.openqa.selenium.firefox.GeckoDriverService$Builder  I rebuild the jar and everything works fine now.  2nd solution In the pom.xml, I moved up the ""selenium-firefox-driver"" dependency to the top of the dependencies, like that :                org.seleniumhq.selenium         selenium-firefox-driver         ${selenium.version}                   org.seleniumhq.selenium         selenium-java         ${selenium.version}                   org.seleniumhq.selenium         selenium-api         ${selenium.version}       etc.  And it works well.  If it's witten as below (as it was previously), then it's the chrome service that ends up in the ""org.openqa.selenium.remote.service.DriverService$Builder"" file. I actually don't know why but I checked several times to make it sure.                org.seleniumhq.selenium         selenium-java         ${selenium.version}                   org.seleniumhq.selenium         selenium-firefox-driver         ${selenium.version}                   org.seleniumhq.selenium         selenium-api         ${selenium.version}       This doesn't work.  ________________________________ De : Diego Molina ***@***.***> Envoyé : mercredi 13 octobre 2021 10:51 À : SeleniumHQ/selenium ***@***.***> Cc : Jean-Luc BARRILLOT ***@***.***>; Author ***@***.***> Objet : Re: [SeleniumHQ/selenium] FirefoxDriver crashes in toExecutor() method (#9907)   Environment in the IDE and the jar itself are different.

This PR is to create a workaround solution to help IEDriver track new created windows in Edge IEMode without using the NewWindow3 API.   ### Types of changes Note that when Edge runs in IEMode, all IE windows are wrapped by an Edge window. That means, every IE window is a child window of a Edge window. It is possible to keep track of all IE window handles before and after a new window created. By comparing the window handles before after a new window event, the new window handles created from client side JS codes can be identified and tracked in IEDriver.","closed","","guangyuexu","2021-10-18T21:04:46Z","2021-10-25T13:57:57Z"

This is a naive implementation, consider this PR mainly for discussions.  I think it's critical to get consistency across the python code base to make contributing as simple as possible with a clean (automatic) UX.  Ideally I'd like to get something like `pre-commit` (https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) applying this stuff automatically on git pre-commit to avoid needless churn and be as as effecient as possible; formatting is only one small benefit there, we can use it to automate a whole heap of useful stuff.  Thoughts?  If we feel this is beneficial I will look at implementing it properly; for now I have just did a 'quick pass' of the tooling to show what it may look like.  I think the consistency is a massive plus.  We can make slight adjustments to the configuration if we need, or even go with a completely different formatter but I'd like to see something alongside `flake8`.  I would strongly push implementing `pre-commit` with some hooks on the client side.

The IEDriver crashed when IE (or Edge in IEMode) tried to parse the unicode regex ending with `/gu`.   ### Types of changes In this PR, a browser type check is added to let IE (or Edge in IEMode) use `/g` regex and other browsers use `/gu` unicode regex in the file.

I noticed a lot of the tests use a camel case naming, in python we should opt for snake case as best as possible; with the help of regex & the `string manipulation` plugin for pycharm (highly recommend it!) I've went through all the `def test*` functions inside `/py/test/selenium*` and rejigged them into snake case.  This also has some extra pieces of:  - Remove duplicate test names (likely not executing the former defined ones as they are overwritten in the namespace) - Made _some_ non test functions (utility) inline with snake case - Removed some redundant fixtures from tests  Kinda relying on CI to give me a steer in any fallout here; but I was quite meticulous when going through it; so should be minimal (I hope).","closed","","symonk","2022-03-29T21:23:21Z","2022-04-07T21:01:51Z"

Avoid large PRs, help reviewers by making them as simple and short as possible.     ### Description -Added TargetAttached event to Target domain in order to allow consumers of DevTools session to be informed about new targets. -Added SendCommands function to DevToolsSession. This function is needed when using the Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger command in conjuntion with other commands. Using the singular SendCommand function will result in blocking issues. -Added waitForDebugger argument to InitializeSession function DevToolsSession to enable/disable waiting for the debugger to attach. By default it's disabled because that's current behavior.   ### Motivation and Context  When a new target (new tab for instance) is created DevTools continues execution based on the WaitForDebugger property set in the SetAutoAttach feature. When the WaitForDebugger property is set to false DevTools continues without waiting the consumer to properly enable all domains on the target. For instance when being interested in network events from the network domain we need to invoke Network.enable for that specific target. The current behavior causes some of the network events to be missing due to Selenium enabling the domains after the target already performed network requests.  By allowing consumers to enable the WaitForDebugger property we can enable all domains and tell DevTools whenever we are ready by using the Run.runIfWaitingForDebugger command.    ### Types of changes  - [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) - [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)  ### Checklist   - [x] I have read the [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. - [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - [x] All new and existing tests passed.","open","C-dotnet,","EdwinVanVliet","2022-05-03T10:16:02Z","2022-06-19T22:34:11Z"

Avoid large PRs, help reviewers by making them as simple and short as possible.     ### Description  Fixes https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10010 and https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10301.  ### Motivation and Context  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/017f2c7f62963353ecc2fd662027676f193b9935 introduced the use of ServiceLoader in creating the FirefoxDriver instance. This was to support the legacy system and XpiDriverService. However, legacy support was long deprecated by Selenium and now it is removed via https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/d4dba1c07a1d8601f80b9e71be7853317ab0d49d, https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/12c8c2752b3ec8dcc05175e85b7ccf5c363dcefe, and https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/commit/5fc8b53b579d08753b0f89cc6307c5a1bc0e539e. ServiceLoader introduced a problem while packaging jars as the `META-INF/services/org.openqa.selenium.remote.service.DriverService$Builder` files would overwrite each other and FirefoxDriver would not be detected while creating the FirefoxDriver instance. Removing the dependency of using ServiceLoader while creating the instance fixes this.  ### Types of changes  - [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - [X] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)  ### Checklist   - [X] I have read the [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. - [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - [X] All new and existing tests passed.","closed","","pujagani","2022-02-23T11:02:31Z","2022-02-23T11:56:33Z"

"","10205","[🐛 Bug]: Getting Error: ECONNRESET read while trying to connect to a Selenium Standalone running on a Docker container on Windows 10 host.","### What happened? I am running a Selenium Standalone Server as a Docker container on my Windows 10 host. On my host, I have a Node.js script that uses selenium-webdriver package to connect to this Selenium Server container, but the script constantly returns this error: ``` ECONNRESET read ECONNRESET     at ClientRequest. (C:\path-to-my-script\node_modules\selenium-webdriver\http\index.js:297:15)     at ClientRequest.emit (events.js:400:28)     at Socket.socketErrorListener (_http_client.js:475:9)     at Socket.emit (events.js:400:28)     at emitErrorNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:106:8)     at emitErrorCloseNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:74:3)     at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:82:21) ``` *Please note that I've added a new line of `console.log(e)` after index.js:279 that makes the line numbers different than the original library. For your information, the output of that line shows:* ``` Error: read ECONNRESET     at TCP.onStreamRead (internal/stream_base_commons.js:209:20) {   errno: -4077,   code: 'ECONNRESET',   syscall: 'read' } ``` ## A little Background about my experiments on this issue: ### A brief quote about the meaning behind this error: > ""ECONNRESET"" means the other side of the TCP conversation abruptly closed its end of the connection. ([citation link](https://www.quora.com/What-does-%E2%80%9CError-read-ECONNRESET%E2%80%9D-mean)) ### Using a different Webdriver (PHP Webdriver): When I use PHP Webdriver from (https://github.com/php-webdriver/php-webdriver), everything works perfectly fine. A new instance of a Firefox browser runs and navigates through the URL I want fully-functional, but when I use this library on Node.js, I only get this error, and the Selenium Server doesn't react to anything (The library cannot make this request, therefore throws this ECONNRESET exception). ### Running this Selenium Docker container on a Linux CentOS 7 host: When I run this Node.js script to connect to the Selenium Standalone Docker container on a CentOS 7 virtual-machine host, everything works perfectly fine. Therefore, it seems to be a problem with this library communicating with Windows [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).  ## My Node.js Code: ``` const {Builder, By} = require('selenium-webdriver');  (function run(){     try {         let driver = await new Builder()         .forBrowser('firefox')         .usingServer(`http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`)         .build();                  console.log(""Done"");     } catch(e) {         console.log(e);     } await driver.get('https://google.com'); })(); ``` ## My Selenium Standalone bash script: `java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0.jar standalone --override-max-sessions true --max-sessions 20 --session-timeout 1800` ## My Dockerfile: *Link: https://github.com/iliaamiri/selenium-on-Linux-setup-dependencies/blob/main/Dockerfile*  ## My scripts to run this Docker Container ### Script for Linux host:  `docker run -it -p 4444:4444 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix redbolder/selenium_standalone_firefox_centos` ### Script for Windows host: `docker run -it -p 4445:4444 -e DISPLAY=192.168.1.2:0.0 -v c:/tmp/X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix redbolder/selenium_standalone_firefox_centos`  ## Every information about the technologies I have mentioned above: **Selenium Standalone Version:** 4.0.0 **Java Version:** JRE 8u311 Linux x64 **Linux Virtual Host:** CentOS 7 (Core) **Docker on Linux Virtual Host:** Docker Engine - Community - 20.10.10 **Docker on Windows Host:** Docker Engine - Community - 20.10.11 **Windows Host:** Windows 10 Pro **Docker Container Operation System:** CentOS 8 **Node.js Version:** 14.17.6  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Please refer to this Github Repository: https://github.com/iliaamiri/selenium-webdriver-javascript-ECONNRESET-read-issue ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Error: ECONNRESET read ECONNRESET     at ClientRequest.

"","10050","[🐛 Bug]: Confusing JAVA API documentation, failed to cast org.openqa.selenium.remote.ShadowRoot","### What happened?  With Chrome 96 update, our tests broke because of shadow DOM handling. I have tried to update selenium from v3.141.59 to v4.0.0 and this also breaks the code. I can solve it and it's fine but I don't understand. In the [documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/package-summary.html) I can't find the definition of this class. I have found the new `getShadowRoot()` method in the documentation. The problem is that from the code this method is only available from `RemoteWebElement`. Simple `WebElement` doesn't implement this method in the code, but the documentation still contains it. Furthermore, in the documentation the `getShadowRoot` method returns `SearchContext` and not `ShadowRoot`.... Which documentation should I use? Previously the attached code worked fine.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell private static ExpectedCondition jsReturnsShadowRoot(WebElement parent) {       return new ExpectedCondition() {           @Override           public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) {               return (WebElement) ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(""return arguments[0].shadowRoot"", parent);           }       };   } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell org.openqa.selenium.remote.ShadowRoot cannot be cast to org.openqa.selenium.WebElement java.lang.ClassCastException: org.openqa.selenium.remote.ShadowRoot cannot be cast to org.openqa.selenium.WebElement ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  Java 4.0.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10045","[🐛 Bug]: uploadFile not working with docker images exposing chromedriver directly","### What happened?  While trying to switch to latest selenium api 4.0, we hit the issue with the uploadFile. Generally if we use selenium chrome standalone docker image there are no issues, as that one uses selenium server internally.  But if you use other distributions (like selenoide/vnc:chrome_95.0) which allow to easily do video recording of the tests, the uploadFile will fails as it doesn't know the command with .../se/file since that is not implemented in the chromedriver out of the box, instead it should use .../file which is implemented.  As both should be possible, I suppose we need a fallback mechanism to allow this to work, or eventually a mechanism to detect or turn it one based on environment variable / system properties.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell - Assuming it's a java based project - Assuming it enable LocalFileDetector in your driver with following: ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector()); - Assuming the page have a input of type ""file"" - On your selenium element, sendKeys(...) with corresponding filepath in the input element of type ""file""  observe the error in the logs (see below)  This is due to the current code (1) which force to use .../se/file for UPLOAD_FILE operation, while chromedriver implement it at .../file already.

While executing selenium tests with latest version of selenium, it opens the browser but fails to navigate to website when opened browser is not in the foreground of the screen. For example if we execute the tests through Jenkins on remote desktop, if the remote desktop is opened on local screen in foreground it executes the tests perfectly fine but fails when the remote connection is put in background/minimized. Local execution works fine because for each session it brings the browser in foreground of the screen.

When using `RemoteWebDriverBuilder.config()` to set a `ClientConfig` instance that does not contain a `baseUri` and does not set an address with `address()` method, the `build()` method will get a non null return from `this.getLocalDriver()`, but that method does not create a driver using the provided `ClientConfig` values.  I don't actually see a way to set a `ClientConfig` for local driver sessions, which, if that's the case, is a bigger issue to address.

"","10759","[🐛 Bug]: (Java)(Python) S3-S4 W3C Mode Not Supported Using ExpectedConditions","### What happened?  When the user attempts to wait for an `ExpectedCondition` to occur, some of them use an API that will result in a 404 error, which is to `findElement`.  This is due to the fact that unlike JWP, this command returns an error and ends the server session according to W3C spec:  https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#find-element https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-no-such-element  vs JWP which returns the element or `null` if not found:  https://webdriver.io/docs/api/jsonwp/#findelement  This problem exists in both [Java](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/d594da2f5c2df8deeb56c9c45c67373edb75b6d5/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.java) and [Python](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/3824c3e9c5bb66b768e5ba2b56e8427e4f4f3c59/py/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions.py) instances of `ExpectedConditions`/`expected_conditions`.    Currently the problemed functions use:  ```java driver.findElement(locator); ```  ```python driver.find_element(*locator) ```  Both which can fail according to the W3C spec.  The solution would be to do something different such as leveraging `findElements`:  ```java driver.findElements(locator); ```  ```python driver.find_elements(*locator) ```  Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-find-elements    This is because it will return the result no matter what, not an error, which could very well be an empty array. I feel the best solution would be to use that and grab the first element in most cases since this is the default behavior of the `findElement` function anyway. If there is no element, that would need to be handled as if the condition were true or false per function also.  ""If result is empty, return [error](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-error) with [error code](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-error-code) [no such element](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-no-such-element). Otherwise, return the first element of result.""  `visibilityOfAllElementsLocatedBy` is already using this function so it makes a good template even if it checks all elements (and we would just check the first one in most? cases).    The affected functions from what I can see are:  **Java**  presenceOfElementLocated visibilityOfElementLocated textToBePresentInElementLocated textToBePresentInElementValue frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt invisibilityOfElementLocated invisibilityOfElementWithText elementSelectionStateToBe attributeToBe textToBe textMatches attributeContains visibilityOfNestedElementsLocatedBy presenceOfNestedElementLocatedBy presenceOfNestedElementLocatedBy presenceOfNestedElementsLocatedBy  **Python**  presence_of_element_located visibility_of_element_located text_to_be_present_in_element text_to_be_present_in_element_value text_to_be_present_in_element_attribute frame_to_be_available_and_switch_to_it invisibility_of_element_located element_to_be_clickable element_located_to_be_selected element_located_selection_state_to_be element_attribute_to_include  The unit tests for [ExpectedConditionsTest](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/d594da2f5c2df8deeb56c9c45c67373edb75b6d5/java/test/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditionsTest.java) and [expected_conditions_tests](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/test/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions_tests.py) 'may' need looked at.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?

This is due to the fact that unlike JWP, those commands are not supported, and W3C only allows getRect as per spec.  https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#get-element-rect  Only JWP (not W3C) allows those two as supported commands:  https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/legacy/json_wire_protocol/#sessionsessionidelementidlocation https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/legacy/json_wire_protocol/#sessionsessionidelementidsize  The code in Selenium 3 should have checked for W3C mode like the Python implementation does, and choose accordingly. Selenium 4 is W3C mode purely and the code should have been migrated to support only that. It is currently still using JWP commands.  This means that the Python and Java implementations are not in sync, and the Java implementation is incorrect. The `getLocation` and `getSize` code for Selenium 4 could just use the `getRect` as a function in both implementations since that's all that's available, and wrap around it to extract the relevant data.  **Java** - Selenium 3 [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-3.150.0/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebElement.java#L363) - Selenium 4 [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-4.1.4-java/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebElement.java#L319)  **Python** - Selenium 3 [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-3.150.0/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py#L524) - Selenium 4 [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-4.1.4-python/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py#L613)    ---   The solution for Selenium 4 Java (and similarly Python) can just be something like:  ```java @Override @SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""}) public Point getLocation() {   Rectangle rect = getRect();   return rect.getPoint(); }  @Override @SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""}) public Dimension getSize() {   Rectangle rect = getRect();   return rect.getDimension(); }  @Override @SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""}) public Rectangle getRect() {   Response response = execute(DriverCommand.GET_ELEMENT_RECT(id));   Map rawRect = (Map) response.getValue();   int x = ((Number) rawRect.get(""x"")).intValue();   int y = ((Number) rawRect.get(""y"")).intValue();   int width = ((Number) rawRect.get(""width"")).intValue();   int height = ((Number) rawRect.get(""height"")).intValue();   return new Rectangle(x, y, height, width); } ```  or for consistency, this:  ```java @Override @SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""}) public Point getLocation() {   Response response = execute(DriverCommand.GET_ELEMENT_RECT(id));   Map rawPoint = (Map) response.getValue();   int x = ((Number) rawPoint.get(""x"")).intValue();   int y = ((Number) rawPoint.get(""y"")).intValue();   return new Point(x, y); }  @Override @SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""}) public Dimension getSize() {   Response response = execute(DriverCommand.GET_ELEMENT_RECT(id));   Map rawSize = (Map) response.getValue();   int width = ((Number) rawSize.get(""width"")).intValue();   int height = ((Number) rawSize.get(""height"")).intValue();   return new Dimension(width, height); }  @Override @SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""}) public Rectangle getRect() {   Response response = execute(DriverCommand.GET_ELEMENT_RECT(id));   Map rawRect = (Map) response.getValue();   int x = ((Number) rawRect.get(""x"")).intValue();   int y = ((Number) rawRect.get(""y"")).intValue();   int width = ((Number) rawRect.get(""width"")).intValue();   int height = ((Number) rawRect.get(""height"")).intValue();   return new Rectangle(x, y, height, width); } ```  In Selenium 3 this was a parameterized choice of one or the other based on whether the test was run in JWP or W3C modes. in Selenium 4, those two functions are basically just helper/wrapper functions.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  Visit a webpage (Selenium) or a WebView (Appium) in W3C mode, and attempt to get the size or location of a `WebElement`.  `webElement.getLocation();`  `webElement.getSize();`  The workaround is to use the API directly as the fix above would suggest and use:  `webElement.getRect().getPoint();`  `webElement.getRect().getDimension();`  The problem with this is that a lot of teams that are using this for their testing and want to migrate already have much of their code written in the former use case. It would ease the friction of migration and save lost hours of debugging time to correct the implementation and allow teams to use their code in its existing state without the workaround.   ### Relevant log output  **Description:** ""Cannot call non W3C standard command while in W3C mode ""  When using `getLocation()`  ```shell at org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.W3CHttpResponseCodec.createException(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:187) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.W3CHttpResponseCodec.decode(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:122) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.W3CHttpResponseCodec.decode(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:49) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.HttpCommandExecutor.execute(HttpCommandExecutor.java:158) at io.appium.java_client.remote.AppiumCommandExecutor.execute(AppiumCommandExecutor.java:250) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.execute(RemoteWebDriver.java:552) at io.appium.java_client.DefaultGenericMobileDriver.execute(DefaultGenericMobileDriver.java:41) at io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver.execute(AppiumDriver.java:1) at io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidDriver.execute(AndroidDriver.java:1) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebElement.execute(RemoteWebElement.java:285) at io.appium.java_client.DefaultGenericMobileElement.execute(DefaultGenericMobileElement.java:45) at io.appium.java_client.MobileElement.execute(MobileElement.java:1) at io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidElement.execute(AndroidElement.java:1) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebElement.getLocation(RemoteWebElement.java:337) ```  --  When using `getSize()`  ```shell at org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.W3CHttpResponseCodec.createException(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:187) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.W3CHttpResponseCodec.decode(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:122) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.http.W3CHttpResponseCodec.decode(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:49) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.HttpCommandExecutor.execute(HttpCommandExecutor.java:158) at io.appium.java_client.remote.AppiumCommandExecutor.execute(AppiumCommandExecutor.java:250) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.execute(RemoteWebDriver.java:552) at io.appium.java_client.DefaultGenericMobileDriver.execute(DefaultGenericMobileDriver.java:41) at io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver.execute(AppiumDriver.java:1) at io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidDriver.execute(AndroidDriver.java:1) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebElement.execute(RemoteWebElement.java:285) at io.appium.java_client.DefaultGenericMobileElement.execute(DefaultGenericMobileElement.java:45) at io.appium.java_client.MobileElement.execute(MobileElement.java:1) at io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidElement.execute(AndroidElement.java:1) at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebElement.getSize(RemoteWebElement.java:346) ```   ### Operating System  Not Applicable but on macOS against Android and iOS  ### Selenium version  Java Selenium 3 and 4  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

Using driver.switchTo().window() code only changes the focus of the program.  During runtime, we observed that the above code does not change the focus of the screen.  We have come up to the solution of using driver.switchTo().window() and send key (CTRL + Tab) to switch both program and screen focus. However, since send keys are unstable (not returning any indication whether it successfully switched tab or not), we would like to know is it possible to have the driver.switchTo().window() code support both program and screen focus switch for Edge IE mode? Is it expected that driver.switchTo().window() only supports program focus?

When I followed the instruction as posted on [official selenium documentation]( https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/capabilities/shared/#proxy ) on how to configure webdriver to utilize proxy in python by using DesiredCapabilities, the session that was connected to the target URL showed that it was connected from my IP address instead of the proxy ip address that I set up. Furthermore, when I checked driver.desired_capabilities it shows that it is using localhost ip address instead of the proxy address as if the setup that was done prior had no effect at all (The result from ip checking website shows my ip addres instead). This behavior, however does not appear and it works fine when I followed the [instruction on C#](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/capabilities/shared/#proxy) as every worked correctly.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell from seleniumwire import webdriver import time  proxy_ip = ""xx.xx.xx.xx"" proxy_port = xxxx  PROXY_STR = ""{}:{}"".format(proxy_ip,proxy_port)  webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX['proxy'] = { ""httpProxy"": PROXY_STR, ""ftpProxy"": PROXY_STR, ""sslProxy"": PROXY_STR, ""proxyType"": ""MANUAL"",  }  with webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='./firefox_drivers/geckodriver.exe') as driver:     driver.get(""https://ipinfo.io"")     print(driver.desired_capabilities['proxy'])     time.sleep(400) ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell 1649525375697	geckodriver	INFO	Listening on 127.0.0.1:61488 1649525378751	mozrunner::runner	INFO	Running command: ""C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe"" ""--marionette"" ""--remote-debugging-port"" ""61489"" ""-no-remote"" ""-profile"" ""C:\\Users\\schwi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\rust_mozprofilexrv1d6"" 1649525378995	Marionette	INFO	Marionette enabled console.warn: SearchSettings: ""get: No settings file exists, new profile?""

"","9956","[🐛 Bug]: Unexpected error creating WebSocket DevTools session calling GetDevToolsSession with v4.0.0 C# bindings and Selenium Server","### What happened?  When I execute a new RemoteWebDriver in C# against a Selenium 4.0.0 server running locally on the same computer and Chrome v94 the call to GetDevToolsSession() throws an unexpected exception as follows ...  ``` {""Unexpected error creating WebSocket DevTools session.""} ```  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  Within a project in **Visual Studio Professional 2015** (other versions untested) ensure the NuGet package **Selenium.WebDriver v4.0.0** is installed and the **Target framework** of the project is **.NET Framework 4.7**.  Create a program with the following code ...  ``` using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; using OpenQA.Selenium; ```  ....  ``` ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions(); IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(""http://localhost:4444""), options.ToCapabilities()); var devTools = driver.GetDevToolsSession(); ```  Ensure the Selenium server **selenium-server-4.0.0.jar** exists on the computer. Ensure java is installed (version **1.8.0_231** tested).  Start the Selenium server with the following command in a CLI ...  ``` ""\java.exe"" -Xmx128m -jar \selenium-server-4.0.0.jar standalone ```  Run the program above in Debug mode in Visual Studio. Execution of the GetDevToolsSession call above will trigger the exception .... mentioned above.    ### Expected behavior  It is expected that the call to GetDevToolsSession is successful (no exception).  Have tested this call (using the code above) with the Selenium.WebDriver v4.0.0 NuGet package in combination with Selenium Server v4.0.0 Release Candidate 3 and is successful.  Selenium.WebDriver v4.0.0 NuGet package in combination with Selenium Server v4.0.0 (not Release Candidate 3) is however unsuccessful (as per bug report above).  I have also tried the Selenium 4.0.0 server and RemoteWebDriver with Chrome 93 and experience a different exception.    Have also tried to use Chrome 95 though this was in beta at the time and I could not understand how to configure the ""binary"" attribute of the ""stereotype"" parameter in the Selenium Grid (TOML) config file to successfully point to the local path for Chrome Beta on my PC.    ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  4.0.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

Working JavaScript example (which is polling and including the frequency at which it polls:   ```shell const { Builder } = require(""selenium-webdriver"");  function myFunc() {   console.log(""hello world""); }  (async function example() {   let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(""chrome"").build();   await driver.get(""http://google.com"");   // should log 5 times, polling every 1 second then times out   await driver.wait(myFunc, 5000, ""Timed out after 5 seconds"", 1000);   await driver.close(); })(); ```     ### How can we reproduce the issue?    ```shell import { Builder } from ""selenium-webdriver"";  function myFunc() {   console.log(""hello world""); }  (async function example() {   let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(""chrome"").build();   await driver.get(""http://google.com"");   // should log 5 times, polling every 1 second then times out   await driver.wait(myFunc, 5000, ""Timed out after 5 seconds"", 1000);   await driver.close(); })(); ```  Note: if we cast the `driver` to `any` we are able to get it polling correctly:   ``` await (driver as any).wait(myFunc, 5000, ""Timed out after 5 seconds"", 1000); ```  ### Relevant log output  ```shell index.ts:11:65 - error TS2554: Expected 1-3 arguments, but got 4. 11   await driver.wait(myFunc, 5000, ""Timed out after 5 seconds"", 1000); ```  Issue is within `types.d.ts:`   ```  wait(condition: WebElementCondition, opt_timeout?: number, opt_message?: string): WebElementPromise; ```  ### Operating System  macOS  ### Selenium version  4.1.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

We run selenium in github actions, when not killing the process properly, github action has problems of getting rid ot the test runner, leading to a timeout. `driver.quit` do not kill the process like it is needed (see https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10795).   This issue is handled with the PR https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/10796 which removes the functions `getDefaultService` and `setDefaultService`. Unfortunally this PR includes breaking changes and made it into version ^4.  Previously the functions where used like this when starting a service: ```ts   if (seleniumChrome.getDefaultService().isRunning()) {     await seleniumChrome.getDefaultService().kill()   }   const service = new seleniumChrome.ServiceBuilder(chromedriver.path).build()   seleniumChrome.setDefaultService(service) ```  We use mocha as a test runner (`yarn test` triggers it), which will opens a chrome browser in the before hook.  In github actions under **Complete job** this will be logged: ``` 1 Cleaning up orphan processes 2 Terminate orphan process: pid (1701) (node) 3 Terminate orphan process: pid (1712) (sh) 4 Terminate orphan process: pid (1713) (node) 5 Terminate orphan process: pid (1720) (node) 6 Terminate orphan process: pid (1729) (chromedriver) 7 Terminate orphan process: pid (1808) (chromedriver) 8 Terminate orphan process: pid (1885) (chromedriver) ... 76 Terminate orphan process: pid (7060) (chrome) ```  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  A github action runner running selenium 4.3.1. Inside `yarn test` we simply use mocha to start the browser and close/quit it.  ```yml name: Test Runner  on:   workflow_dispatch:   repository_dispatch:     types: [test]  jobs:   e2e_chrome:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     timeout-minutes: 20      steps:       - uses: actions/setup-node@v1         with:           node-version: 16.13.2        - uses: actions/checkout@v2         with:           ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}       - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1        - run: yarn test ``` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Cleaning up orphan processes Terminate orphan process: pid (1701) (node) Terminate orphan process: pid (1712) (sh) Terminate orphan process: pid (1713) (node) Terminate orphan process: pid (1720) (node) Terminate orphan process: pid (1729) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (1808) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (1885) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (1965) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2051) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2123) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2201) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2281) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2354) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2427) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2505) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2581) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2669) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2754) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2831) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2915) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (2994) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3070) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3146) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3220) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3299) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3390) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3467) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3543) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3622) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3699) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3770) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3845) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (3925) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4003) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4077) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4152) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4226) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4303) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4380) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4450) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4523) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4601) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4674) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4748) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4836) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4908) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (4980) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5053) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5141) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5220) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5294) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5368) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5445) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5517) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5593) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5671) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5753) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5830) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5912) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (5986) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6062) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6135) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6209) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6286) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6361) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6439) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6516) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6591) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6670) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6745) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6817) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6896) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (6978) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (7054) (chromedriver) Terminate orphan process: pid (7060) (chrome) ```   ### Operating System  Ubuntu latest  ### Selenium version  4.3.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10178","[🐛 Bug]: Attempting to get Selenium Standalone working with WebKitGTK browsers and WebKitWebDriver","### What happened?  We run our tests on GitHub Actions in Selenium/Standalone-Chrome container images.  We're looking to experiment with also including WebKitGTK browsers.  I successfully created [WebKitWebDriver-Browser-Images](https://github.com/jamesmortensen/WebKitWebDriver-Browser-Images), a multi-arch container image, which uses Epiphany browser and MiniBrowser, alongside WebKitWebDriver, which also accepts remote connections. I connected WebdriverIO to it using the following capabilities:  ``` capabilities: [{         maxInstances: 1,         browserName: 'MiniBrowser',         browserVersion: '2.34.1',         'webkitgtk:browserOptions': {             args: [                 '--automation'             ], // ln -s /usr/lib/`arch`-linux-gnu /usr/lib/linux-gnu             binary: `/usr/lib/${ARCH}-linux-gnu/webkit2gtk-4.0/MiniBrowser`         }     }], ```  We're able to run tests standalone, but I believe if we want to include WebKitGTK browsers in a Selenium Grid, the containers will also need to be running Selenium as a node.  I've experimented with some modifications to the config.toml file in order to see if I can register MiniBrowser via standalone mode, as shown below:  ``` # cat ../selenium/config.toml  [network] relax-checks = true  [node] session-timeout = ""300"" override-max-sessions = false detect-drivers = false max-sessions = 1  [[node.driver-configuration]] display-name = ""WebKitGTK"" stereotype = '{""browserName"": ""WebKitGTK"", ""browserVersion"": """", ""platformName"": ""Linux""}' max-sessions = 1 webdriver-executable = '/usr/bin/WebKitWebDriver' ```  As you can see, I've included the WebDriver binary location.  However, I get the following exception when trying to launch the Selenium server:  ``` Selenium Grid Standalone configuration:  [network] relax-checks = true  [node] session-timeout = ""300"" override-max-sessions = false detect-drivers = false max-sessions = 1  [[node.driver-configuration]] display-name = ""WebKitGTK"" stereotype = '{""browserName"": ""WebKitGTK"", ""browserVersion"": """", ""platformName"": ""Linux""}' max-sessions = 1  Starting Selenium Grid Standalone... 09:13:45.628 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 09:13:45.652 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 09:13:46.296 INFO [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Detected 1 available processors java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) 	at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Bootstrap.runMain(Bootstrap.java:77) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:70) Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ConfigException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.MemoizedConfig.getClass(MemoizedConfig.java:115) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.getNode(NodeOptions.java:131) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.commands.Standalone.createHandlers(Standalone.java:203) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridServerCommand.asServer(TemplateGridServerCommand.java:41) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.commands.Standalone.execute(Standalone.java:214) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridCommand.lambda$configure$4(TemplateGridCommand.java:129) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.launch(Main.java:83) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.go(Main.java:57) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.main(Main.java:42) 	... 6 more Caused by: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) 	at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ClassCreation.callCreateMethod(ClassCreation.java:50) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.MemoizedConfig.lambda$getClass$4(MemoizedConfig.java:100) 	at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.computeIfAbsent(ConcurrentHashMap.java:1737) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.MemoizedConfig.getClass(MemoizedConfig.java:95) 	... 14 more Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ConfigException: Unable to find matching driver for Capabilities {browserName: WebKitGTK, browserVersion: , platformName: Linux, se:vncEnabled: true} 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.lambda$addDriverConfigs$11(NodeOptions.java:351) 	at java.base/java.util.Optional.orElseThrow(Optional.java:408) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.lambda$addDriverConfigs$15(NodeOptions.java:350) 	at java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1541) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.lambda$addDriverConfigs$16(NodeOptions.java:323) 	at java.base/java.util.Optional.ifPresent(Optional.java:183) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.addDriverConfigs(NodeOptions.java:277) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.getSessionFactories(NodeOptions.java:190) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.local.LocalNodeFactory.create(LocalNodeFactory.java:76) 	... 22 more  ```  The exception error message appears [here in this part of the code](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/3a2181467904af9043828cede13e5dc866c1af12/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/node/config/NodeOptions.java#L351) but I'm not sure what's needed to make this work.  Am I using the wrong variation of the name?  ""WebKitGTK"" vs ""webkitgtk2"", etc, or does a separate implementation need to be created, similar to ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, ChromeOptions, FirefoxOptions, etc?    Hoping to get a little insight on what I can do to make this work.  Thank you!  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  To reproduce the issue, please build the container image from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamesmortensen/WebKitGTK-Selenium-Standalone). This is a minimum reproducible example.    Once built, run the container, then go to http://localhost:7900 and open a terminal. Alternatively, use docker exec to bash into the container.    On start of the container, you'll see the exceptions. From within the container shell, you can try other alternative inputs to the config.toml (WebKitGTK, webkitgtk all lowercase, etc).  The variations of capitalization I tried all resulted in the same exception.  To start the selenium server, I'm using the shell script within the container:  ```shell $ /opt/bin/start-selenium-standalone.sh ```  ### Relevant log output  ```shell Selenium Grid Standalone configuration:  [network] relax-checks = true  [node] session-timeout = ""300"" override-max-sessions = false detect-drivers = false max-sessions = 1  [[node.driver-configuration]] display-name = ""WebKitGTK"" stereotype = '{""browserName"": ""WebKitGTK"", ""browserVersion"": """", ""platformName"": ""Linux""}' max-sessions = 1  Starting Selenium Grid Standalone... 09:13:45.628 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 09:13:45.652 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 09:13:46.296 INFO [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Detected 1 available processors java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) 	at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Bootstrap.runMain(Bootstrap.java:77) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:70) Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ConfigException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.MemoizedConfig.getClass(MemoizedConfig.java:115) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.getNode(NodeOptions.java:131) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.commands.Standalone.createHandlers(Standalone.java:203) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridServerCommand.asServer(TemplateGridServerCommand.java:41) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.commands.Standalone.execute(Standalone.java:214) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridCommand.lambda$configure$4(TemplateGridCommand.java:129) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.launch(Main.java:83) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.go(Main.java:57) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.main(Main.java:42) 	... 6 more Caused by: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) 	at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) 	at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ClassCreation.callCreateMethod(ClassCreation.java:50) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.MemoizedConfig.lambda$getClass$4(MemoizedConfig.java:100) 	at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.computeIfAbsent(ConcurrentHashMap.java:1737) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.MemoizedConfig.getClass(MemoizedConfig.java:95) 	... 14 more Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.ConfigException: Unable to find matching driver for Capabilities {browserName: WebKitGTK, browserVersion: , platformName: Linux, se:vncEnabled: true} 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.lambda$addDriverConfigs$11(NodeOptions.java:351) 	at java.base/java.util.Optional.orElseThrow(Optional.java:408) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.lambda$addDriverConfigs$15(NodeOptions.java:350) 	at java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1541) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.lambda$addDriverConfigs$16(NodeOptions.java:323) 	at java.base/java.util.Optional.ifPresent(Optional.java:183) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.addDriverConfigs(NodeOptions.java:277) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.config.NodeOptions.getSessionFactories(NodeOptions.java:190) 	at org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.local.LocalNodeFactory.create(LocalNodeFactory.java:76) 	... 22 more ```   ### Operating System  macOS 12.0.1 Apple M1, but running in a Debian 11 ARM/Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 container image.

We have a project written in .NET (specifically .NET Core 3.1) using Selenium, and we build a Linux Docker image from that app. We have the following code for initializing the driver:  ``` var path = Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)); var driver = new ChromeDriver(ChromeDriverService.CreateDefaultService(path), chromeOptions, chromeSettings.Value.CreativePageLoadTimeout); ```  Whenever this code is run, we get the following error message: ``` [10:05:06 ERR] An unexpected error occurred while processing a request System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (2): No such file or directory    at System.Diagnostics.Process.ForkAndExecProcess(String filename, String[] argv, String[] envp, String cwd, Boolean redirectStdin, Boolean redirectStdout, Boolean redirectStderr, Boolean setCredentials, UInt32 userId, UInt32 groupId, UInt32[] groups, Int32& stdinFd, Int32& stdoutFd, Int32& stderrFd, Boolean usesTerminal, Boolean throwOnNoExec)    at System.Diagnostics.Process.StartCore(ProcessStartInfo startInfo)    at System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()    at OpenQA.Selenium.DriverService.Start()    at OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DriverServiceCommandExecutor.Execute(Command commandToExecute)    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.Execute(String driverCommandToExecute, Dictionary`2 parameters)    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.StartSession(ICapabilities desiredCapabilities)    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver..ctor(ICommandExecutor executor, ICapabilities capabilities)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Chromium.ChromiumDriver..ctor(ChromiumDriverService service, ChromiumOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome.ChromeDriver..ctor(ChromeDriverService service, ChromeOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout) ```  We've confirmed that the ""chromedriver"" file does indeed exist in the specified directory by SSHing into the Docker container. We have also tried not specifying a path, specifying the root path, and many other combinations but they all result in the same problem.  If the project is debugged locally in Windows (ie. not running within a Linux Docker instance) then everything works as expected.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell I can't share this project as is but I can create and share a new reproduceable project with you if needed. ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell [10:05:06 ERR] An unexpected error occurred while processing a request System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (2): No such file or directory    at System.Diagnostics.Process.ForkAndExecProcess(String filename, String[] argv, String[] envp, String cwd, Boolean redirectStdin, Boolean redirectStdout, Boolean redirectStderr, Boolean setCredentials, UInt32 userId, UInt32 groupId, UInt32[] groups, Int32& stdinFd, Int32& stdoutFd, Int32& stderrFd, Boolean usesTerminal, Boolean throwOnNoExec)    at System.Diagnostics.Process.StartCore(ProcessStartInfo startInfo)    at System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()    at OpenQA.Selenium.DriverService.Start()    at OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.DriverServiceCommandExecutor.Execute(Command commandToExecute)    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.Execute(String driverCommandToExecute, Dictionary`2 parameters)    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver.StartSession(ICapabilities desiredCapabilities)    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriver..ctor(ICommandExecutor executor, ICapabilities capabilities)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Chromium.ChromiumDriver..ctor(ChromiumDriverService service, ChromiumOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome.ChromeDriver..ctor(ChromeDriverService service, ChromeOptions options, TimeSpan commandTimeout) ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10, Alpine Linux  ### Selenium version  .NET   ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10870","[🐛 Bug]: Error handling in Java e.g. SessionNotCreatedException/UnreachableBrowserException caused by Error","### What happened?  We had some issues with our system, this lead to an OutOfMemoryError error. This is nothing Selenium should try to handle and wrap into a SessionNotCreatedException or UnreachableBrowserException in `RemoteWebDriver#execute`.  The javadoc of [Error](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Error.html) states `... indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.`  By wrapping this into a SessionNotCreatedException or UnreachableBrowserException the Error is ""downgraded"" to a [RuntimeException](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/RuntimeException.html), `... superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine.`  One might try to run the browser on a different machine after a SessionNotCreatedException has has occurred. But the real reason might be a local issue (e.g. OutOfMemoryError, NoClassDefFoundError, etc.)  I am not sure if there are other places on which this applies.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell public static void main(String[] args) {     new RemoteWebDriver(new CommandExecutor() {         @Override         public Response execute(Command command) throws IOException {             throw new OutOfMemoryError(""this just a fake"");         }     }, new ChromeOptions()); } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Exception in thread ""main"" org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Could not start a new session.

"","10576","[🐛 Bug]: unable to connect the node to the hub: Could not bind to address or port is already in use","### What happened?  We are using AWS EC2 instance with OS version debian 9 and trying to start a selenium node version 4 on the EC2 instance using the below command , but it is giving the error as ""Could not bind to address or port is already in use""  java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --host $public_ip --hub  http://127.0.0.1:35577/wd/hub --publish-events tcp://127.0.0.1:5442 --subscribe-events tcp://127.0.0.1:5443 --detect-drivers false --log-level ""fine"" --port 5555 --override-max-sessions true --max-sessions 74 --max-threads 55 --driver-configuration display-name=""$(hostname)"" max-sessions=74  stereotype='{""browserName"":""chrome"",""cluster:pcgeo"":""geo""}'  The  hub is running on a normal linux machine with debian 11 . To connect to the hub which is installed on the linux machine, on EC2 instance we are using port forwarding and the hub is behind a haproxy load balancer. So the local port 35577 on the EC2 instance will make a connection to the frontend haproxy bind port 35555 which will forward the requests to the linux machine (debian11) where the hub is running on the port 4444  Even though there are no process running on the port 5555 on EC2 instance we still get the error as 'Could not bind to address or port is already in use'. Selecting a random port for the node is giving the same error.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --host $public_ip --hub  http://127.0.0.1:35577/wd/hub --publish-events tcp://127.0.0.1:5442 --subscribe-events tcp://127.0.0.1:5443 --detect-drivers false --log-level ""fine"" --port 5555 --override-max-sessions true --max-sessions 74 --max-threads 55 --driver-configuration display-name=""$(hostname)"" max-sessions=74  stereotype='{""browserName"":""chrome"",""cluster:pcgeo"":""geo""}' ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell [07:09][sdf@ip-172-31-15-152:selenium-server]$ java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --host $public_ip --hub  http://127.0.0.1:35577/wd/hub --publish-events tcp://127.0.0.1:5442 --subscribe-events tcp://127.0.0.1:5443 --detect-drivers false  --log-level ""fine"" --port 57843 --override-max-sessions true --max-sessions 74 --max-threads 55 --driver-configuration display-name=""$(hostname)"" max-sessions=74 stereotype='{""browserName"":""chrome"",""cluster:pcgeo"":""aws_paris""}' 07:10:05.343 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 07:10:05.350 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 07:10:05.509 DEBUG [AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdkBuilder.build] - Global OpenTelemetrySdk set to OpenTelemetrySdk{tracerP rovider=SdkTracerProvider{clock=SystemClock{}, idGenerator=RandomIdGenerator{}, resource=Resource{schemaUrl=https://opente lemetry.io/schemas/1.8.0, attributes={service.name=""unknown_service:java"", telemetry.sdk.language=""java"", telemetry.sdk.na me=""opentelemetry"", telemetry.sdk.version=""1.10.1""}}, spanLimitsSupplier=SpanLimitsValue{maxNumberOfAttributes=128, maxNum berOfEvents=128, maxNumberOfLinks=128, maxNumberOfAttributesPerEvent=128, maxNumberOfAttributesPerLink=128, maxAttributeVa lueLength=2147483647}, sampler=ParentBased{root:AlwaysOnSampler,remoteParentSampled:AlwaysOnSampler,remoteParentNotSampled :AlwaysOffSampler,localParentSampled:AlwaysOnSampler,localParentNotSampled:AlwaysOffSampler}, spanProcessor=SimpleSpanProc essor{spanExporter=org.openqa.selenium.remote.tracing.opentelemetry.SeleniumSpanExporter$1@16267862}}} by autoconfiguration 07:10:05.614 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Connecting to tcp://127.0.0.1:5442 and tcp://127.0.0.1:5443 07:10:05.700 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Sockets created 07:10:06.704 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Event bus ready 07:10:07.119 INFO [NodeServer.createHandlers] - Reporting self as: http://public_ip_of_ec2:5555 07:10:07.165 INFO [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Detected 1 available processors 07:10:07.166 WARN [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Overriding max recommended number of 1 concurrent sessions.

"","10055","[🐛 Bug]: Trace selenium webDriver within Docker does not appear ?","### What happened?  We are using a Firefox-based selenium webDriver for testing purposes. Using a dockerized approach, we are also using a standalone Firefox selenium image _(see Docker-compose)_. We have a crash that refers to `Failed to decode response from marionette`, such issue has already been solved a lot in this repository issues section. However, we did not find a way to fix it and we would like to export the selenium webDriver trace to see if we can better understand what is going on or if we should create a new issue following logs, so we would appreciate any help you can provide. Following the snippet that follows, how can we track the log in the docker, as it does not display elsewhere at the moment:  ```python   firefox_profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(fp_path) #fp_path is not  relevant to be added here it is our firefox profile path  options = webdriver.FirefoxOptions()   options.browser_version = '92'  options.platform_name = 'Windows 10'  options.page_load_strategy = 'eager'  options.log.level = ""TRACE""   driver = webdriver.Remote(command_executor=""http://selenium:4444/wd/hub"",                            desired_capabilities=DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX,                            browser_profile=firefox_profile,                            options=options) ```  So, here's our docker-compose file (Note: we use the shm_size as recommended a lot in many issues's threads):  ```shell version: ""3"" services:   selenium:     image: selenium/standalone-firefox:4.0.0-rc-3-20211010     ports:       - 4444:4444       - 7900:7900     mem_limit: 2500m     mem_reservation: 2500m     shm_size: 2gb    our_solution:     container_name: our_solution_container_name     build:       context: .     volumes:       - ./data:/app/data       - ./src:/app/src       - ./api:/app/api     command: sleep 5000     depends_on:       - selenium     ports:       - 8050:8050     shm_size: '4gb'     mem_limit: 2500m     mem_reservation: 2500m ```  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Using:  - Docker version 20.10.8, build 3967b7d - selenium/standalone-firefox:4.0.0-rc-3-20211010 - Python 3.7  To run this snippet, create a docker-compose using the selenium standalone-firefox image (as seen above) as its first service and a simple Python solution as its second.

Given the following `package.json`:  ```json {   ""dependencies"": {     ""selenium-webdriver"": ""^4.1.2""   } } ```  Run the sample code in `index.js` with `node index.js`:  ```javascript const { Builder, By, Key, until } = require(""selenium-webdriver""); (async function example() {   let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(""chrome"").build();   try {     await driver.get(""http://www.google.com/ncr"");     await driver.findElement(By.name(""q"")).sendKeys(""webdriver"", Key.RETURN);     await driver.wait(until.titleIs(""webdriver - Google Search""), 1000);   } finally {     await driver.quit();   } })(); ```  With Node.js v18, I get:  ``` ➜ node index.js   /Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/index.js:51     throw new Error('Invalid URL: ' + aUrl)           ^  Error: Invalid URL: http:/     at getRequestOptions (/Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/index.js:51:11)     at new HttpClient (/Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/index.js:90:21)     at getStatus (/Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/util.js:38:18)     at checkServerStatus (/Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/util.js:76:14)     at /Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/util.js:74:5     at new Promise ()     at Object.waitForServer (/Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/http/util.js:57:10)     at /Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/remote/index.js:251:24     at new Promise ()     at /Users/werner/Desktop/selenium-node-test/node_modules/selenium-webdriver/remote/index.js:246:20  Node.js v18.1.0 ```  With Node.js v16 (the current LTS release), it works fine. It should be noted though that with v18, the variables for the `.format` call are:  ``` serverUrl: http:/, hostname: undefined, port: 52511, self.path_: / ```  Whereas for v16, the variables are:  ``` serverUrl: http://127.0.0.1:52535/, hostname: 127.0.0.1, port: 52535, self.path_: / ```  Notably, the hostname is undefined in Node.js v18. This leads me to the function `os.networkInterfaces()` whose output is different in v18 compared to v16.  Here is v16:  ``` > os.networkInterfaces() {   lo0: [     {       address: '127.0.0.1',       netmask: '255.0.0.0',       family: 'IPv4',       mac: '00:00:00:00:00:00',       internal: true,       cidr: '127.0.0.1/8'     }    ... ```  And here is v18:  ``` > os.networkInterfaces() {   lo0: [     {       address: '127.0.0.1',       netmask: '255.0.0.0',       family: 4,       mac: '00:00:00:00:00:00',       internal: true,       cidr: '127.0.0.1/8'     },     ... ```  See that the `family` property now reads `4` and not `IPv4`.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Shown above. ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Log already shown in reproducible example above. ```   ### Operating System  Any  ### Selenium version  4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

Would appreciate any idea on how to go about debugging the issue ```ts async function loginFromHomePage(page: BasePage) {   const { password, phoneNumber } = LoginConfig.loginDetails;   try {     await page.get(`${page.baseUrl}/login`);     await page.driver.executeScript(""localStorage.clear()"")     await page.driver.navigate().refresh()     await skipCookiesDialogue(page)     // it throws an error at this point     const loginByCellButton = await page.driver.wait(       until.elementLocated(By.id(""loginWithCellButton"")),       10000     ); // wait for a maximum of 10 seconds for the login button to appear        await page.driver.wait(until.elementIsEnabled(loginByCellButton), 10000); // wait for a maximum of 10 seconds for the login button to be enabled);       await loginByCellButton.click();      // find the phone number and password input then send keys     const inputs = await page.findAll(       ""input.MuiInputBase-input.MuiFilledInput-input"",       80000     );     await Promise.all([       inputs[0].sendKeys(phoneNumber),       inputs[1].sendKeys(password),     ]);      // find the login button and click it     const loginButton = await page.driver.findElement(By.name(""button""));     await loginButton.click();      // if we can find the play button, we are logged in     const playButton = await page.find(""#firstTimeDialogPlayButton"", 20000);     await page.driver.wait(until.elementIsVisible(playButton), 5000);     await playButton.click();    } catch (error) {     throw new Error(""There was an error logging in from homepage"");   } } ```  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell export default async function skipCookiesDialogue(page: BasePage ) {   const el = await page.find(`.cookieDialogue`, 5000); //uses a maximum of 5sec to find the element   const dialogue = await page.driver.wait(until.elementIsVisible(el))    const el2 = dialogue.findElement(By.css("".acceptBtn""))   const acceptButton = await page.driver.wait(until.elementIsEnabled(el2))    await acceptButton.click()    await page.driver.sleep(250) //wait for half a second for modal to close }  async function loginFromHomePage(page: BasePage) {   const { password, phoneNumber } = LoginConfig.loginDetails;   try {     await page.get(`${page.baseUrl}/login`);     await page.driver.executeScript(""localStorage.clear()"")     await page.driver.navigate().refresh()     await skipCookiesDialogue(page)     // it throws an error at this point     const loginByCellButton = await page.driver.wait(       until.elementLocated(By.id(""loginWithCellButton"")),       10000     ); // wait for a maximum of 10 seconds for the login button to appear        await page.driver.wait(until.elementIsEnabled(loginByCellButton), 10000); // wait for a maximum of 10 seconds for the login button to be enabled);       await loginByCellButton.click();      // find the phone number and password input then send keys     const inputs = await page.findAll(       ""input.MuiInputBase-input.MuiFilledInput-input"",       80000     );     await Promise.all([       inputs[0].sendKeys(phoneNumber),       inputs[1].sendKeys(password),     ]);      // find the login button and click it     const loginButton = await page.driver.findElement(By.name(""button""));     await loginButton.click();      // if we can find the play button, we are logged in     const playButton = await page.find(""#firstTimeDialogPlayButton"", 20000);     await page.driver.wait(until.elementIsVisible(playButton), 5000);     await playButton.click();    } catch (error) {     throw new Error(""There was an error logging in from homepage"");   } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:56896/devtools/browser/2c60a25e-2447-4323-b022-ab8aaea0bebe     1) ""before all"" hook for ""Should display Menu button""     0 passing (20s)   1 failing    1) Side bar test        ""before all"" hook for ""Should display Menu button"":      WebDriverError: unknown error: unexpected command response   (Session info: chrome=103.0.5060.134)       at Object.throwDecodedError (node_modules\selenium-webdriver\lib\error.js:522:15)       at parseHttpResponse (node_modules\selenium-webdriver\lib\http.js:589:13)       at Executor.execute (node_modules\selenium-webdriver\lib\http.js:514:28)       at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)       at thenableWebDriverProxy.execute (node_modules\selenium-webdriver\lib\webdriver.js:740:17)       at thenableWebDriverProxy.findElements (node_modules\selenium-webdriver\lib\webdriver.js:1066:17) ```   ### Operating System  windows 10  ### Selenium version  4.3.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10152","[🐛 Bug]: Selenium is working well under Docker container but not when deployed on cloud","### What happened?  To begin, we have devised a solution using Selenium that scrapes for the purpose of obtaining some freely available data but is not very expensive in terms of processing. The solution is both locally and dockerized (locally again) working. While we are currently attempting to deploy it utilising AZURE ACR/ACI beneath these docker containers. Things change, the solution ceases to function properly despite the fact that no code changes have been made. Our question is, could you possibly lead us toward creating a good crash log, given what we now have was already there previously (locally on docker / locally on our machine)? Or, if you notice a crash in our traceback, could you direct us to the cause and solution? _Note: We have heard about directly outputting a crash file from the web remote driver, but we could not find any documentation on this; perhaps we missed the good documentation page._  ### How can we reproduce the issue?   Using a simple way for scraping data from a web page. Every aspect of the system should be dockerized. See the results of utilising Azure ACR for docker container storage and ACI for obtaining a remote address. What we have noticed is that if we do not do a lot on each page that opens, there is no ""crash"" However, if we open ten pages and scrape information from each, everything will crash. We initially encountered this issue on Docker locally, as our Docker desktop did not allow for sufficient RAM. However, here we have ten gigabytes of memory and two CPUs available for the selenium grid docker container as well as our Python solution under its docker container.   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Everything could be retrieves on this Hastening output log:  https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/imibibepex.apache ```   ### Operating System  Azure container Instance under linux ubuntu latest stable version  ### Selenium version  Selenium GRID 4.1.0 stable version  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10471","[🐛 Bug]: Selenium grid 4 hub becomes unresponsive to new sessions when Chrome does not start","### What happened?  This is an issue that we have seen regularly since we began using Selenium Grid 4 a few months ago, and only recently were able to conjecture as to the cause.  We have noticed that when Chrome fails to start on one of the nodes, the hub becomes unresponsive to new requests coming into it.  The hub continues to respond to its health checks and serves HTTP requests, but no new sessions begin across any of the nodes.  We only see this behavior on our selenium grid that receives very frequent traffic and almost always has one or two sessions running on it.  We have unfortunately not been able to reproduce outside of our Kubernetes cluster.  We also have not been able to detect a pattern with when the issue occurs.  Sometimes it will happen within hours of the selenium grid being redeployed on the cluster, and sometimes we will go days without running into the issue.  We are also unsure of what more can be done to debug the situation.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  These are the environment variables that are supplied to the Chrome node containers: ```       SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST:                  se4-hub       SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT:        4443

The Node.js example [in the docs](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/support_packages/chrome_devtools/#emulate-geo-location) is not working as the bindings don't connect to a target.

If you add a wait (e.g. `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))` you will see that it returns with:  ``` {""id"":1,""error"":{""code"":-32601,""message"":""'Emulation.setGeolocationOverride' wasn't found""} ```  It seems that the bindings don't attach to a target like other [bindings do](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/b8de36fdc3cc215fca14e0251bf8583556b5bffc/py/selenium/webdriver/common/bidi/cdp.py#L290), e.g. call `Target.attachToTarget` retrieve the session id and send this along at all times.    ### How can we reproduce the issue?

"","10731","Codespell report for ""Selenium"" (on fossies.org)","### What happened?  The FOSS server [fossies.org](https://fossies.org) - supporting now also the [Selenium](https://fossies.org/linux/selenium) project - offers among others a feature named ""[Source code misspelling reports](https://fossies.org/features.html#codespell)"". Such reports are normally only generated on request, but as Fossies administrator I have just created for testing purposes such a [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) based analysis for the ""Selenium"" development version:   https://fossies.org/linux/test/selenium-trunk.tar.gz/codespell.html  That version-independent URL should redirect always to the report for the latest ""trunk"" version identified by the short GitHub commit ID and a year-month-day string (YYMMDD) representing the according git pull date (mostly = commit date). The data are residing within a special restricted ""test"" folder that isn't really integrated into the standard Fossies services and should also not be accessible to search engines. The report should be available at least for some weeks and is continuously updated (currently with a half-hourly refresh rate).  By the way, the context type of the spelling errors and typos are marked by a single character (within the sortable column ""T""): The less interesting, probably not user visible ones (in ""comments"") are greyed, while the probably more interesting ones are black-colored. Especially interesting may be unassigned errors marked by a ""?"" since they may be contained in the source code itself. Some more according information is offered by a tooltip if the mouse is over the string ""error context type character"" above the table, over the ""T"" in the table header or over such a context character itself within the table. If JavaScript is enabled all table columns are sortable.  Although after a first review some obviously wrong matches (""False Positives"" = FPs) are already filtered out (ignored) please inform me if you find more of them so that I can exclude them if applicable.  Just for information there are also three supplemental pages showing some used ""codespell"" [configuration details](https://fossies.org/linux/test/selenium-trunk.tar.gz/codespell_conf.html), all obvious [false positives](https://fossies.org/linux/test/selenium-trunk.tar.gz/codespell_fps.html) and a [misspelling history](https://fossies.org/linux/test/selenium-trunk.tar.gz/codespell_hist.html) (log).  OK, spelling corrections certainly have a low priority, but they may also contribute to the overall quality of a software project. So I hope that the report can nevertheless be a little bit useful.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell N/A ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell N/A ```   ### Operating System  N/A  ### Selenium version  N/A  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

The aim in my project is to get a kiosk-like fullscreen firefox that does not show any menu, search or address bar, even if you hover with the mouse over the top screen. The only way to get out of the fullscreen should be by pressing the F11 key.  To achieve that I already tried the following: [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1323320 ](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1323320)  This works fine when using firefox without the webdriver. As far as I know the use of specific profiles has been deprecated, so the chrome folder with the userChrome.css will not be copied, hence it will not be taken into account when firefox is called via selenium/geckodriver.  The next approach was using firefox preferences via Options(). There is a way to prevent the bars from showing up by using  ´  full-screen-api.ignore-widgets | true -- | --   ´  This also works fine, but in combination with the command driver.fullscreen_window() it ends up in a windowed firefox which is not fullscreen nor maximized.  I then tried to first maximize the window and then calling the fullscreen command, but even with that it first maximizes the window and subsequently ends up in a smaller windowed firefox which always has a certain size.  I ended up using pyautogui.press('f11'), but that really should not be the answer to the problem. Why not using Chrome and chromedriver? Because I'd like to stick with python and firefox.  Below you will find the code with testing an existing firefox profile.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell options=Options() options.Profile='C:/Users/Tissi/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/xx513scw.Selenium_Test' options.binary_location = 'C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe' options.set_preference(""full-screen-api.ignore-widgets"", True) service = Service(r'C:\Python310x64\geckodriver') driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=service, options=options) driver.maximize_window() driver.fullscreen_window() ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell I do not have any log. ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  Selenium 4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10623","[🐛 Bug]: Wrong type for screenshot_as_png","### What happened?  The `WebElement` class in `selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py` file has a property `screenshot_as_png` which declare the return type as `str`, but it returns the output of `b64decode` method which returns `bytes`.  See the `screenshot_as_png` source code in selenium 4.1.5 package. It looks like this one:  ```python     @property     def screenshot_as_png(self) -> str:         """"""         Gets the screenshot of the current element as a binary data.          :Usage:             ::                  element_png = element.screenshot_as_png         """"""         return b64decode(self.screenshot_as_base64.encode('ascii'))  ``` So the `screenshot_as_png` seems to return `str` but in runtime it returns `bytes`. The `str` type for return value should be changed to `bytes`.  If you run the example below, then it works as expected - the screenshot variable is `bytes` but PyCharm (and mypy) complains for line 10 that `Expected type 'bytes', got 'str' instead ` which is not true in runtime.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell from chromedriver_binary.utils import get_chromedriver_path from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By   def test():   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=get_chromedriver_path() + '/chromedriver')   driver.get('http://www.example.com/')   element = driver.find_element(by=By.TAG_NAME, value='h1')   screenshot:bytes = element.screenshot_as_png   print(type(screenshot))   if __name__ == '__main__':   test() ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell No log needed. ```   ### Operating System  Gentoo Linux  ### Selenium version  Python 4.1.5  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  it's not relevant  ### What are the browser driver(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  it's not relevant  ### Are you using Selenium Grid?  _No response_","closed","needs-triaging,","eNcacz","2022-05-09T15:46:25Z","2022-06-09T00:11:19Z"

"","9965","[🐛 Bug]: Selenium W3C dialect creating issue when I draw something on canvas","### What happened?  Thank you for helping in advance.  The issue is when w3c is true, all the actions performed are from center of the canvas, i.e. the drawing starts from the center of the canvas and end also at the center of the canvas. But the same is not true in case w3c is false because in case w3c is false the start and end are on top left corner of the element.  I just wanted to understand, is this behavior of selenium w3c is intentional or it's a bug.  Any suggestion will be really helpful.

Take a look at:  https://github.com/cocorossello/junit-parallel-broken-when-using-selenium  It's basically a parallel test suite with 8 tests throttled to 2 threads that sleeps for 2 seconds, total execution time should be >= 8 seconds.  It works when no selenium is used at all. When I open a selenium window that throttling is broken.  So, I guess that selenium (or one of its dependencies... maybe asynchttpclient) must be doing something weird with the ForkJoinPool used by junit   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Check out the sample project and do a  ./gradlew test  It will fail.

Some of the elements under the special symbols on html page such as (for example): `` or: ``  are not visible by Selenium.

So it would be great to fix Selenium to work with it.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```         WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();         WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();         driver.manage().window().maximize();         driver.get(""https://mamikos.com/"");         WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);         WebElement accessibleEl = driver.findElement(By.id(""home""));         WebElement notAccessibleEl = driver.findElement(By.id(""loginModal""));         wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(accessibleEl));         wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(notAccessibleEl)); ```  Expected behavior: Selenium can find both accessibleEl and notAccessibleEl elements.

Try to pass in the absolute path to your chromedriver.exe and see if the system cannot find the file specified.

"","10499","[🐛 Bug]: JS- ECONNREFUSED when using two WebDrivers and .quit()ing one","### What happened?  So I have two built web drivers. On each I navigate to a specific site with a .get(). Then on one of them I use .quit() to close it. Then i try to use the second driver that is still open and try to navigate to a different site(really just do anything with the driver). Upon trying to use the second driver that should still be opened and using any API call, I get this ECONNREFUSED error. It appears that for some reason calling .quit() on the first driver also destroys the communication between selenium and the second driver.  I have pinpointed that this bug was introduced in Selenium 4.0.0-alpha.5 and has persisted until the latest version of selenium(4.1.1). Trying to do this should work as it works with versions prior to 4.0.0-alpha.5.   This same behavior also occurs MsEdgeDriver. Which leads me to believe this is a problem with selenium and not chromedriver. Also worth noting that this does not occur when using geckodriver.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell const { exec, spawn } = require('child_process'); const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver'); const BROWSER_NAME = webdriver.Browser.CHROME; const chrome = require('selenium-webdriver/chrome');  async function startChromedriver() {     const chromedriverExecutable = process.platform === 'win32' ?

First, when recursive access reaches about 20 times, it will be unable to get the window handle. Using the normal IE or normal Edge, the problem with not occur and could get the child window handle permanently, so this problem seems only to occur in IE mode.  Second, selenium timeout occurs.

You may need to include a dependency on a specific version of the CDP using something similar to `org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-devtools-v86:4.1.0` where the version (""v86"") matches the version of the chromium-based browser you're using and the version number of the artifact is the same as Selenium's.

Original description on Selenium Doc is as below  `For a map, return a Map with values following the rules above.`  As I thought, the word ""map"" should be more common to avoid misunderstanding, e.g. object.  If this ""map"" is only cover the Java Map, it's fine,  below code will return a Map  `((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(""return arguments[0]"", map)` But no other steps can cover common Object in Java, so it will go to  `For all other cases, a String is returned`  If this map is standing as JavaScript Map, what's the expected response from WebDriver? Try to call the WebDriver as below: `{   ""script"": ""return new Map([['key1','value1'],['key2','value2']])"",   ""args"": [   ] }` The Chrome will return a empty list by   `[null]` ![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3264250/153707448-806eaf1d-d96f-482b-bb7e-8cad44e2d7e6.png)  The Firefox will return a empty object by `{}` ![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3264250/153707445-5a51f67b-3c6c-41ac-99e9-54b3b3e70097.png)  As I thought, the expected value might same as Firefox did, it might be a defect on ChromeDriver, so address a ticket on there for tracking https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=4031    Finally, I think the original ""For a map"" might point to a object.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Below Code are under Chrome  Map:  Code 1 ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(""return new Map([['key1','value1'],['key2','value2']])"");  Code 2 ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(""return new Map()"");  Set: ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(""return new Set()"");  All above code will return the empty list just like below execution: ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(""return [null]""); ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell 2022-02-12 17:40:41 [Forwarding executeScript on session 18038b0c57e548a03be48eaa79260bcd to remote] DEBUG o.a.netty.request.NettyRequestSender.pollPooledChannel(593) - Using pooled Channel '[id: 0xdd3430a4, L:/127.0.0.1:10332 - R:localhost/127.0.0.1:58332]' for 'POST' to 'http://localhost:58332/session/18038b0c57e548a03be48eaa79260bcd/execute/sync' 2022-02-12 17:40:41 [Forwarding executeScript on session 18038b0c57e548a03be48eaa79260bcd to remote] DEBUG o.a.netty.request.NettyRequestSender.sendRequestWithOpenChannel(251) - Using open Channel [id: 0xdd3430a4, L:/127.0.0.1:10332 - R:localhost/127.0.0.1:58332] for POST '/session/18038b0c57e548a03be48eaa79260bcd/execute/sync' 2022-02-12 17:40:42 [AsyncHttpClient-1-2] DEBUG o.a.netty.handler.HttpHandler.handleHttpResponse(70) -   Request DefaultHttpRequest(decodeResult: success, version: HTTP/1.1) POST /session/18038b0c57e548a03be48eaa79260bcd/execute/sync HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: selenium/4.1.2 (java windows) Content-Length: 88 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 host: localhost:58332 accept: */*  Response DefaultHttpResponse(decodeResult: success, version: HTTP/1.1) HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 cache-control: no-cache content-length: 16  2022-02-12 17:40:42 [AsyncHttpClient-1-2] DEBUG o.a.netty.channel.ChannelManager.tryToOfferChannelToPool(270) - Adding key: http://localhost:58332 for channel [id: 0xdd3430a4, L:/127.0.0.1:10332 - R:localhost/127.0.0.1:58332] ```   ### Operating System  Win10  ### Selenium version  Java 4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

NOTE : The same exact script works on Firefox `94.0.1` with `GeckoDriver` `v0.30.0` on the same exact machine  Selenium is expecting \*Chrom\* to load pages way faster than it can do, querying elements when the elements aren't still loaded resulting on errors.  It only ever happened to me on NVIDIA Driver download pages  When switching from the `*nix` driver list page (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/) to the appropriate download page.   It seems to have loaded the page from the outside (i.e all elements *seem* loaded when looking at the webpage, but in depth they aren't), so when I try to query an attribute of an element (like with  ```python driver.find_elements(     By.CSS_SELECTOR,     ""#mainContent > table:nth-child(3) > tbody:nth-child(1) > tr:nth-child(1) > td:nth-child(1) > ""     ""a:nth-child(1)"")[0].get_attribute(""href"") ``` ) that isn't loaded it fails (see errors 1 and 2)  Will have a report on both Google and MS websites too  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By  driver = Chrome() #or ChromiumEdge() driver.get(""https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/"") link_text = driver.find_elements(     By.CSS_SELECTOR,     f""#rightContent > p:nth-child(1) > a:nth-child(3)"")[0].text driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, link_text).click() # Only works consistently with a time.sleep(1) driver.find_element(By.ID, ""lnkDwnldBtn"").click() dl_link = driver.find_elements(     By.CSS_SELECTOR,     ""#mainContent > table:nth-child(3) > tbody:nth-child(1) > tr:nth-child(1) > td:nth-child(1) > ""     ""a:nth-child(1)"")[0].get_attribute(""href"") driver.close() ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell --- ERROR 1 ---  Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""./main.py"", line 184, in      dl_link, driver_version = get_dl_url(os_code=os_code, branch_code=branch_code)   File ""./main.py"", line 161, in get_dl_url     driver.close()   File ""/home/stig124/.local/share/virtualenvs/autonvidia-ouBhMtGZ/lib/python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py"", line 937, in close     self.execute(Command.CLOSE)   File ""/home/stig124/.local/share/virtualenvs/autonvidia-ouBhMtGZ/lib/python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py"", line 424, in execute     self.error_handler.check_response(response)   File ""/home/stig124/.local/share/virtualenvs/autonvidia-ouBhMtGZ/lib/python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/errorhandler.py"", line 247, in check_response     raise exception_class(message, screen, stacktrace) selenium.common.exceptions.InvalidSessionIdException: Message: invalid session id Stacktrace: #0 0x55eedc1d3473  #1 0x55eedbc48307  #2 0x55eedbc74e6f  #3 0x55eedbc76315  #4 0x55eedc1fd2a7  #5 0x55eedc20ce6d  #6 0x55eedc20cbe9  #7 0x55eedc20d312  #8 0x55eedc1fe7bb  #9 0x55eedc20d605  #10 0x55eedc1f43d5  #11 0x55eedc224638  #12 0x55eedc2247e8  #13 0x55eedc23edaa  #14 0x7fca97c73b37  #15 0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   --- ERROR 2 --- Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""./main.py"", line 183, in      dl_link, driver_version = get_dl_url(os_code=os_code, branch_code=branch_code)   File ""./main.py"", line 155, in get_dl_url     dl_link = driver.find_elements( IndexError: list index out of range ```   ### Operating System  openSUSE Tumbleweed  ### Selenium version  Python 3.8.12 | Selenium 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10343","[🐛 Bug]: Ruby `send_keys` wrong for combination like `element.send_keys([:shift, 'a'])` after update to Chromedriver v98","### What happened?  Not sure that this is a best place to report it, I think it may be a bug in Chromedriver itself, but have a bad experience contacting google issue tracker, so I'll start in this repo, sorry if I'm doing this wrong  So after updating Chromedriver to v98 I got troubles with sending those combinations to input areas: ``` element.send_keys([:shift, 'a']) element.send_keys([:control, 'a'])  ``` And probably all others combination of several keys  Example code is attached with chromedriver included: [chromedriver-bug-send-keys.zip](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/files/8033620/chromedriver-bug-send-keys.zip)   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  I've attached archive with required files, but steps are:  1. Create HTML file `test.rb` with: ```                                             ```  2. Create this spec file `test_input_spec.rb`, which will compare result of execution of Chromedriver v97 and v98: ``` # frozen_string_literal: true  require 'rspec' require 'selenium-webdriver'  text_to_input = 'TestText'  describe 'text_input' do   it 'chromedriver 97' do     service = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Service.new(path: ""#{Dir.pwd}/chromedriver_linux_97"")      driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:chrome, service: service)     driver.navigate.to(""file://#{Dir.pwd}/test.html"")     element = driver.find_element(:xpath, '//input')     element.send_keys(text_to_input)     element.send_keys([:shift, 'a'])     expect(element.attribute('value')).to eq(""#{text_to_input}A"")   end    it 'chromedriver 97' do     service = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Service.new(path: ""#{Dir.pwd}/chromedriver_linux_98"")      driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:chrome, service: service)     driver.navigate.to(""file://#{Dir.pwd}/test.html"")     element = driver.find_element(:xpath, '//input')     element.send_keys(text_to_input)     element.send_keys([:shift, 'a'])     expect(element.attribute('value')).to eq(""#{text_to_input}A"")   end end ```  3. Download `ChromeDriver 97.0.4692.71` and `ChromeDriver 98.0.4758.80` and place it in same folder as `chromedriver_linux_97` and `chromedriver_linux_98`  4. run ` rspec text_input_spec.rb` and see output for errors.   And of course I can enter `A` as `A`, not as `[:shift, 'a']`, but it's just for simplicity of example  ### Relevant log output  ```shell Output of this script will be:  .F  Failures:    1) text_input chromedriver 97      Failure/Error: expect(element.attribute('value')).to eq(""#{text_to_input}A"")              expected: ""TestTextA""             got: ""TestTextA""              (compared using ==)      # ./text_input_spec.rb:28:in `block (2 levels) in '  Finished in 2.28 seconds (files took 0.14498 seconds to load) 2 examples, 1 failure  Failed examples:  rspec ./text_input_spec.rb:20 # text_input chromedriver 97 ```  So Chromedriver 97 correctly calls `[:shift, 'a']` as `A`  But chromedriver 98 input `A` instead (some kind of incorrect unicode symbol)  You can see it on screenshot:  ### Operating System  Ubuntu 20.04  ### Selenium version  ruby gem selenium-webdriver (4.1.0)  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?   98.0.4758.80   ### What are the browser driver(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  98.0.4758.80 is broken and everything ok on 97.0.4692.71  ### Are you using Selenium Grid?

The code is not open source, but I have a suspicion that it has to do with my version of `chromium`. I'm on Arch Linux, and after the system update, my `chromium` version is `101`. Does Selenium support this chromium version? If not, then perhaps the error message could be improved.   ### Operating System  Arch Linux  ### Selenium version  4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  chromium 101  ### What are the browser driver(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  chromedriver 101  ### Are you using Selenium Grid?  _No response_","closed","I-defect,","Ploppz","2022-05-23T09:17:09Z","2022-07-08T12:36:09Z"

"","10160","[🐛 Bug]:","### What happened?  My program has been working fine until recently and I have not changed anything in the code. The last time I had a problem with selenium like this it was because my chrome updated its version but this time my chrome version has not changed.  My code does not use anything like SQLite either.  Chrome version: Version 94.0.4606.54 (Official Build) (64-bit) Code I use to launch my selenium:  ``` def launch_web_driver(self,single_website = False):     if self.web_driver is None or not self.check_if_browser_alive():         user_directory = ""C:\\Users\\bestg\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\"" + self.data_dir         config_options = Options()         config_options.add_argument(f'user-data-dir={user_directory}')         try:             self.launch_message()             self.web_driver = webdriver.Chrome(options = config_options)             self.visit_website(self.initial_url)         except Exception as e:             print(f""Selenium error: \n{str(e)}"")             if 'user data directory is already in use' in str(e):                 url = self.web_driver.command_executor._url       #""http://127.0.0.1:60622/hub""                 session_id = self.web_driver.session_id            #'4e167f26-dc1d-4f51-a207-f761eaf73c31                 self.web_driver = webdriver.Remote(command_executor=url,desired_capabilities={})                 self.web_driver.session_id = session_id       elif single_website and self.web_driver.current_url != self.initial_url:         self.visit_website(self.initial_url) ```   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell I am not sure; everything was working fine and then stopped.

"","10551","[🐛 Bug]: Session queue leak","### What happened?  Looks like there's a session queue leak in Selenium 4 causing it to eat up resources in the long run.  When Selenium 4 grid runs out of sessions, incoming session requests go into the session queue.  When a node is freed it takes from the session queue in a FIFO order.  The problem seems to be Selenium is creating two sessions when it takes from the session queue.  The extra session leaves behind temporary resources (scoped_dir_* folders) in the %TMP% folder that are not deleted.  I'm using Windows 10.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell 1. Start Selenium 4 stand alone.  It creates 5 chrome nodes. 2. Write a simple script to get a session from the grid          ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();         options.addArguments(""no-sandbox"");         options.addArguments(""--headless"");         options.addArguments(""--disable-component-update"");         options.addArguments(""--disable-extensions"");         options.addArguments(""start-maximized"");          options.setExperimentalOption(""prefs"", chromePref);         WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(hub), options);          try {           Thread.sleep(60000);           // do something         } catch (Exception ex) {           ex.printStackTrace();         }  3. Run 7 instances 4. In http://:4444/ui/index.html#/, it shows 5 running, 2 in queue. 5. Watch this page, when one of the session ends, Selenium should take one off the queue and create a new session.  However, observe that it creates two sessions when it takes from the queue. 6. When your normal sessions are done, notice two extra sessions still show on the page. 7. Go to %TMP% folder (c:\Users\\AppData\Local\Temp), you will see scoped_dir_* folders not cleaned up.  NOTE: if you run 5 instances, it will NOT leave behind scoped_dir_* folders.  The scoped_dir_* folders can range from 1 MB to ~ 50MB.  It will slowly eat up the system disk space and eventually Selenium won't be able to create new sessions and throw ""failed to write prefs file"". ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell none ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  Selenium 4  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  chrome 100  ### What are the browser driver(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  chrome driver 100  ### Are you using Selenium Grid?

"","10374","[🐛 Bug]: Grid Protocol Converter Insufficient","### What happened?  Java Bindings and the Grid are maintaining a lot of extra code in order to be backwards compatible with earlier versions of Selenium. **Except we don't have any tests to show we've been successful with this**. I ran the old Watir-WebDriver tests using the final version of Se2 for the Ruby bindings against the latest Grid, and 40% of them failed.   #### Updated Update  Found several more issues in Java bindings for OSS code; there are 3 categories: 1. Stuff that was broken in Grid 4 with the Locator Conversions (`name`, `id` & `class name` locators) 2. Stuff that was broken in Server 3.7 when translating JWP/early W3C to W3C (`switchToWindow` & `sendKeysToActiveElement`) — broken running Java bindings 2.53.1 3. Stuff that was broken in Server 3.7 when translating pre-W3C JWP to W3C (locators except `id` & `name`, `implicitlyWait`, `setScriptTimeout` and `switchToFrame`) — broken running Java bindings 2.45.0 or other bindings 2.53.1  This is now looking like a lot more work to fix; and less likely that people are making as much use of the protocol translations as we've thought.  #### Update  * ~The two things definitely affecting the Java bindings actually look like they might be simple to fix~ * I've never seen a framework that didn't have a way to check if an element wasn't there, and didn't use id/name/class name to do so, which indicates to me that no one has tried to run their 2.x code on a 4.x server, otherwise they'd have raised an issue. * No one using Selenium 2 could use Selenium 3 server and switch windows since v3.6 (August 2017), which small sample size, but I've never worked anywhere that I didn't need to switch windows for my test suites. * I was surprised that Selenium Server 2.53 was able to run latest Chrome version so well. If all you care about is Chrome and/or *anything* working, there's zero reason to upgrade off of Server 2.53 right now, (which would explain why there are still so many downloads of it). * Whatever we end up doing, I don't think it is unreasonable that running tests on the latest versions of (non-Chrome) browsers should require updating to a version of Selenium > 3.9 when w3c was pretty much finalized, in February 2018.  Uploaded a repo with 13 failing JWP tests with Grid 4 (and 1 failing JWP test with Server v3 for completeness) https://github.com/titusfortner/grid4conversion/tree/main/src/test/java/com/titusfortner/grid4conversion  #### Options  1. File these as bugs and fix/ignore as time allows until we do a non-backward compatible rewrite in Selenium 5 2. Fix these bugs ASAP and then separate out all the protocol conversion code and provide it the same way we do with leg-rc package 3. Consider it a sunk cost, and just delete all of it now so we can simplify the code and make forward progress  Someone suggested to me that we should proceed with option 3 and if any user really wants option 2, they can pay us/someone to do it, and that makes sense to me with limited resources.  #### Supporting Data  Here are the different combinations I tested with old watir-webdriver specs using Selenium 2.53.4 Ruby bindings with the latest versions of the browsers and the latest versions Selenium (toggling OSS mode on/off in Se 3/4 for Chrome)  | Browser  | Local | Se 2 | Se 3 | Se 3 OSS | Se 4 | Se 4 OSS | Total Tests | | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | | Chrome  | 3  | 1  | 356  | 3  | 489  | 117 | 1235 | | Firefox  | N/A  | N/A  | 364  | N/A  | 516  | N/A  | 1244 | | Safari  | N/A  | N/A  | 302  | N/A  | 404 | N/A  | 1120 |  Things that are broken when running Bindings 2.53.x  * Return JavaScriptEnabled as part of capabilities (Ruby only — won't even try to execute JS if not in caps) * Ensure Window ""name"" parameter is updated to ""handle"" (Java & Ruby) * Delete null values from Cookie arguments (Ruby only — Java deletes null params before sending) * ~Translate click actions with bodies into correct actions (e.g., `{""button"": 2}`)~ (This was broken for Selenium Server 3.x but fixed in Grid 4) * Translate moveTo commands with x/y offsets (Ruby only — Ruby sends null element for just moveTo, Java omits it) * Using `id` or `name` to locate a missing element will throw the wrong error (Java & Ruby) * Using `class name` to locate an element gives unable to determine locator strategy (Java & Ruby) * Sending Key to Active Element gives UnsupportedCommandException (Java & Ruby)  Things that are broken when running Java Bindings 2.45 (or later for other bindings):  * Using `css selector`, `xpath`, `tag name`, `link text`, or `partial link text` values can't be converted to Web Element * Setting script timeout –> Cannot call non W3C standard command while in W3C mode * Setting implicit wait timeout —> Cannot call non W3C standard command while in W3C mode * Switching to Frame by Name —> invalid argument: 'id' can not be string   (Watir doesn't do a whole lot with actions, so it's ~likely~ possible ~a bunch of~ more things are broken in the translation)  @asolntsev is going to try to help us out by running the same experiment with old Selenide test suite for Java. That might tell us more about how bad the situation is. It's possible that other bindings will have fewer issues.  My guess though is that our assumption that Selenium 2 Bindings users can use Selenium 3 Server or Selenium 4 Grid is misguided, and that people still using Selenium 2 are using Selenium 2 server, and we would be better off removing the translation code rather than fixing it.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  Ruby can be reproduced by running watir-webdriver 0.9.3 watirspecs with selenium-webdriver 2.53.4 setting REMOTE, and updating the server start code. Java with JUnit 5: ```java     @Test     void getWindow() {         Set windowHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();         String handle = windowHandles.stream().findFirst().get();          Assertions.assertDoesNotThrow(() -> driver.switchTo().window(handle));     }      @Test     void useIDForMissingElement() {         NoSuchElementException thrown = Assertions.assertThrows(NoSuchElementException.class, () -> {             driver.findElement(By.id(""not-there""));         });          String msg = ""no such element: Unable to locate element: {\""method\"":\""id\"",\""selector\"":\""not-there\""}"";         Assertions.assertTrue(thrown.getMessage().contains(msg));     } ```  ### Relevant log output  ``` Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Returned value cannot be converted to WebElement: {stacktrace=java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to execute request for an existing session: An unknown error has occurred ``` and ``` org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Unexpected exception thrown: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: invalid argument: 'handle' must be a string ```  ### Operating System  MacOS Big Sur  ### Selenium version  Ruby 2.53.4 & Java 2.45.0 & Java 2.53.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

In Selenium Server v3.141.59 we were able to start up Hub and Node processes as Windows Services using [prunsrv.exe](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/procrun.html). We would use it to define all sorts of things, most of which I'll show in the below code. However, in Selenium Server v 4.2.2 I can't seem to start these up in the same way. I get an error in the logs stating the below. Can someone point me in the right direction of what the start class for Selenium Hub should be? The organization of the [files on GitHub](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/trunk/java/src/org/openqa/selenium) seems totally reworked between versions.   Here is what I am using in v4: ```bat SET SERVICE_PASSWORD=ENTER_PW_HERE SET SERVICE_ACCOUNT=SERVICE_ACCOUNT SET PRUNSRV=C:\Selenium\prunsrv.exe SET SELENIUM_HOME=C:\Selenium SET SELENIUM_VERSION=ENTER_VERSION_HERE SET SERVER_NAME=SERVER_NAME  %PRUNSRV% //IS//SeleniumHub ^ --DisplayName=""SeleniumHub"" ^ --Description=""Selenium Hub"" ^ --Install=%PRUNSRV% ^ --LogLevel=Debug ^ --StdOutput=auto ^ --StdError=auto ^ --LogPath=%SELENIUM_HOME%\Logs ^ --LogJniMessages=1 ^ --Jvm=""%JAVA_HOME%\bin\client\jvm.dll"" ^ --Classpath=%SELENIUM_HOME%\selenium-server-standalone-%SELENIUM_VERSION%.jar ^ --Startup=auto ^ --StartMode=jvm ^ --StartClass=org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncherV3 ^ --StartMethod=main ^ --StartParams=-role#hub ^ --StartImage=%SELENIUM_HOME%\test.ico ^ --StopMode=jvm ^ --StopTimeout=60 ^ --StopImage=%SELENIUM_HOME%\test.ico ^ --JvmMs=256 ^ --JvmMx=1024 ^ --JvmSs=4000 ^ --JvmOptions=-Dprunsrv.port=8080 ^ ++JvmOptions=-Dprunsrv.server=localhost  %PRUNSRV% //US//SeleniumHub --ServiceUser %SERVER_NAME%\%SERVICE_ACCOUNT% --ServicePassword %SERVICE_PASSWORD% ```  Here is what worked in v3:  ```bat SET SERVICE_PASSWORD=ENTER_PW_HERE SET SERVICE_ACCOUNT=s SERVICE_ACCOUNT SET PRUNSRV=C:\Selenium\prunsrv.exe SET SELENIUM_HOME=C:\Selenium  %PRUNSRV% //IS//SeleniumHub ^ --DisplayName=""SeleniumHub"" ^ --Description=""Selenium Hub"" ^ --Install=%PRUNSRV% ^ --LogLevel=Debug ^ --StdOutput=auto ^ --StdError=auto ^ --LogPath=%SELENIUM_HOME%\Logs ^ --LogJniMessages=1 ^ --Jvm=%JAVA_HOME%\bin\server\jvm.dll ^ --Classpath=%SELENIUM_HOME%\selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar ^ --Startup=auto ^ --StartMode=jvm ^ --StartClass=org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncherV3 ^ --StartMethod=main ^ --StartParams=-role#hub ^ --StartImage=%SELENIUM_HOME%\test.ico ^ --StopMode=jvm ^ --StopTimeout=60 ^ --StopImage=%SELENIUM_HOME%\test.ico ^ --JvmMs=256 ^ --JvmMx=1024 ^ --JvmSs=4000 ^ --JvmOptions=-Dprunsrv.port=8080 ^ ++JvmOptions=-Dprunsrv.server=localhost  %PRUNSRV% //US//SeleniumHub --ServiceUser SERVER_NAME\%SERVICE_ACCOUNT% --ServicePassword %SERVICE_PASSWORD% ```  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Here are steps I have taken: 1.

Now I want to configure Selenium GRID 4.x with TOML configuration file for the nodes and need to setup parameters (grid-url, max connections) as specified.  Either the documentation seems to be misleading or the parameter is not correctly passed through: Section ""Node"", parameter ""--grid-url"" https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/configuration/cli_options/   Each node must connect to the grid hub instance, which is located on a different machine within my network.  When I start the node instance with the config-file it does not connect to the given URL and it seems to try to connect to my localhost (see the first part in the log).  When I start the node with CLI and use parameter ""hub"" or use the parameter ""hub"" instead of ""grid-url"" the node connects correctly to the grid hub instance.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell (The TOML file is validated) This was assumed to work fine, but does not: [node] grid-url = ""http://mygridserver.com"" max-sessions = 4  I coincidentally found out, that using the works: [node] #the parameter actually should be ""grid-url"" but it works with the CLI parameter ""hub"" hub = ""http://mygridserver.com"" max-sessions = 4  I start the node: java -jar selenium-server-4.1.0.jar node --config node-config.toml ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell When using ""grid-url"" as parameter in TOML config file: C:\Testen\SeleniumGrid>java -jar selenium-server-4.1.0.jar node --config node-config.toml 18:11:13.869 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 18:11:13.872 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 18:11:13.987 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Connecting to tcp://0.0.0.0:4442 and tcp://0.0.0.0:4443 18:11:14.017 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Sockets created 18:11:15.029 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Event bus ready 18:11:15.314 INFO [NodeServer.createHandlers] - Reporting self as: http://172.20.80.1:5555 18:11:15.541 INFO [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Detected 20 available processors 18:11:15.560 INFO [NodeOptions.discoverDrivers] - Discovered 0 driver(s) 18:11:15.589 INFO [NodeOptions.report] - Adding Firefox for {""browserVersion"": ""95"",""browserName"": ""firefox"",""moz:firefoxOptions"": {""binary"": ""C:\u002fTesten\u002fFirefox\u002f""},""platformName"": ""WIN10""} 8 times 18:11:15.590 INFO [NodeOptions.report] - Adding Chrome for {""goog:chromeOptions"": {""binary"": ""C:\u002fProgram Files\u002fGoogle\u002fChrome\u002fApplication\u002f""},""browserVersion"": ""96"",""browserName"": ""chrome"",""se:webDriverExecutable"": ""C:\\Testen\\Driver\\chromedriver.exe"",""platformName"": ""WIN10""} 8 times 18:11:15.602 INFO [Node.] - Binding additional locator mechanisms: id, relative, name 18:11:15.973 INFO [NodeServer$1.start] - Starting registration process for node id 67a37301-14c8-449c-b2d7-0206c3084152 18:11:15.974 INFO [NodeServer.execute] - Started Selenium node 4.1.0 (revision 87802e897b): http://172.20.80.1:5555  When using ""hub"" as parameter in TOML config file: C:\Testen\SeleniumGrid>java -jar selenium-server-4.1.0.jar node --config node-config.toml 18:12:21.653 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 18:12:21.656 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 18:12:21.765 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Connecting to tcp://mygridserver.com:4442 and tcp://mygridserver.com:4443 18:12:21.800 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Sockets created 18:12:22.806 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Event bus ready 18:12:23.077 INFO [NodeServer.createHandlers] - Reporting self as: http://172.20.80.1:5555 18:12:23.302 INFO [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Detected 20 available processors 18:12:23.319 INFO [NodeOptions.discoverDrivers] - Discovered 0 driver(s) 18:12:23.346 INFO [NodeOptions.report] - Adding Firefox for {""browserVersion"": ""95"",""browserName"": ""firefox"",""moz:firefoxOptions"": {""binary"": ""C:\u002fTesten\u002fFirefox\u002f""},""platformName"": ""WIN10""} 8 times 18:12:23.347 INFO [NodeOptions.report] - Adding Chrome for {""goog:chromeOptions"": {""binary"": ""C:\u002fProgram Files\u002fGoogle\u002fChrome\u002fApplication\u002f""},""browserVersion"": ""96"",""browserName"": ""chrome"",""se:webDriverExecutable"": ""C:\\Testen\\Driver\\chromedriver.exe"",""platformName"": ""WIN10""} 8 times 18:12:23.359 INFO [Node.] - Binding additional locator mechanisms: name, relative, id 18:12:23.734 INFO [NodeServer$1.start] - Starting registration process for node id 3179bdd2-a1c9-448d-895a-ab281abe9e9d 18:12:23.735 INFO [NodeServer.execute] - Started Selenium node 4.1.0 (revision 87802e897b): http://172.20.80.1:5555 ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  .Net - Selenium 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10107","[🐛 Bug]: Selenium 4, Python: ShadowRoot find_element only works with css_selector","### What happened?  If you use any other By type than CSS_SELECTOR with a find_element on a shadow root object you get an Invalid Locator error. It seems the tests only test this function with By.CSS_SELECTOR so unsure if this is intentional.   Also the find_element on the ShadowRoot object has a different signature to all other find_element functions (it uses `using` rather than `by`), this makes it annoying if you are trying to call find_element with keyword arguments, as the keyword arguments might be different if you happen to be on a shadow root element.  The other find_element functions do a conversion of the different By types into equivalent By.CSS_SELECTORs so i am wondering if this is missing from the shadow root?  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Change this test:  @pytest.mark.xfail_safari def test_can_find_element_in_a_shadowroot(driver, pages):     pages.load(""webComponents.html"")     custom_element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ""custom-checkbox-element"")     shadow_root = custom_element.shadow_root     element = shadow_root.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ""input"")      assert isinstance(element, WebElement)  To access the element within the shadow_root by tag name instead.  @pytest.mark.xfail_safari def test_can_find_element_in_a_shadowroot(driver, pages):     pages.load(""webComponents.html"")     custom_element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ""custom-checkbox-element"")     shadow_root = custom_element.shadow_root     element = shadow_root.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, ""input"")      assert isinstance(element, WebElement) ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell return shadow_root.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'upload-button')   File ""python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/shadowroot.py"", line 45, in find_element     return self._execute(Command.FIND_ELEMENT_FROM_SHADOW_ROOT, {""using"": using, ""value"": value})['value']   File ""python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/shadowroot.py"", line 64, in _execute     return self.session.execute(command, params)   File ""python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py"", line 424, in execute     self.error_handler.check_response(response)   File ""python3.8/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/errorhandler.py"", line 247, in check_response     raise exception_class(message, screen, stacktrace) selenium.common.exceptions.InvalidArgumentException: Message: invalid argument: invalid locator   (Session info: headless chrome=96.0.4664.45) ```   ### Operating System  Ubuntu  ### Selenium version  Python Selenium 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10906","[🐛 Bug]: dotnet - FindElement By Id Exception says that it is using the CssSelector and it might cause confusion when debugging.","### What happened?  If you execute a WebDriver FindElement ""By Id"" and pass an incorrect value on Chrome using ChromeDriver on Selenium 4.3.0 for dotnet, Selenium will throw an exception that reads like the text below.  `Unable to locate element: {""method"":""css selector"",""selector"":""#PassedValue""}`  This seems to be caused by the way that the By class is used, for example when you search by Id, it seems to use a CssSelectorMechanism and add a # to the argument.   I can provide code to reproduce this issue if needed.  I think this also happens when using FindElement by Name and ClassName.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; using WebDriverManager; using WebDriverManager.DriverConfigs.Impl;  var url = ""https://www.google.com/"";  new DriverManager().SetUpDriver(new ChromeConfig());  var Browser = new ChromeDriver();  Browser.Navigate().GoToUrl(url); Browser.FindElement(By.Id(""feafefewaf"")); ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell OpenQA.Selenium.NoSuchElementException: 'no such element: Unable to locate element: {""method"":""css selector"",""selector"":""#Frame_5""}   (Session info: chrome=103.0.5060.134)' ```   ### Operating System  Windows 11  ### Selenium version  .NET - Selenium 4.3.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I realy need to get acces to this part of the HTML and need a solution maybe there is something in selenium i dont know to trick it.  I Use Chromedriver as follow:  program.options.AddArguments(""disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled""); program.driver3 = new ChromeDriver(program.options);   This is the full html code of the site                           Mailinator                           a {         color: darkblue;     }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Home                                                                                                                               Accessibility                                                                                      Terms                                                                                      Privacy Policy                                                                                                                               Copyright 2022 Manybrain, LLC.

"","10404","[🐛 Bug]: Hub hangs with ""Unable to find session"" after a while","### What happened?  I've set up a Hub and 2 Nodes on three different Ubuntu servers. The Hub is on Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS and the two nodes on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS. Selenium is driven by a Java program using standard libraries.  All works fine for a while (an hour or so), then suddenly the Hub stops responding. The symptoms are:  - when connecting to `http://myhub:4444/ui/index.html` I get the normal ""Selenium Grid"" page but it is stuck on the ""Loading..."" message - the hub output shows many messages containing this:   ``` ""exception.message"": ""Unable to execute request for an existing session: Unable to find session with ID: 98d1a9efa8b787398b29c2d6c5f2ddab Build info: version: '4.1.2', revision: '9a5a329c5a' System info: host: 'controller', ip: 'xx.xx.xx.xx', os.name: 'Linux', os.arch: 'amd64', os.version: '4.4.0-210-generic', java.version: '1.8.0_292' Driver info: driver.version: unknown"" ``` - the java program gets the exception shown in the ""Relevant log output"" box.    If I restart the Hub, all goes back to normal: I don't have to restart either the nodes or the Java program.  Command to start the hub:  ``` java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar hub --config hub.toml ```  Content of hub.toml:  ``` [server] port = 4444 registration-secret = ""xxxxxx"" [sessionqueue] session-request-timeout = 300 ```  Command to start the node:  ``` java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --config node.toml ```  Content of node.toml:  ``` [server] port = 5555 registration-secret = ""xxxxxx"" [node] hub = ""xx.xx.xx.xx"" override-max-sessions = true max-sessions = 8 session-timeout = 60 detect-drivers = false [[node.driver-configuration]] display-name = ""Chrome Latest"" stereotype = ""{\""browserName\"": \""chrome\""}"" webdriver-executable = '/mypath/chromedriver' ```  Output of top (last line is the hub):  ``` top - 15:11:10 up 22:00,  3 users,  load average: 0.20, 0.23, 0.19 Tasks: 208 total,   1 running, 207 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie %Cpu(s): 12.5 us,  1.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 82.3 id,  0.2 wa,  0.0 hi,  1.7 si,  2.2 st KiB Mem :  8175040 total,  1773696 free,  3951596 used,  2449748 buff/cache KiB Swap:  8388604 total,  8348196 free,    40408 used.  3875604 avail Mem    PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND   908 tomcat8   20   0 4055844 1.196g  17808 S  21.9 15.3 115:44.34 java  1183 mysql     20   0 1670676 528960  15472 S   2.3  6.5  25:39.78 mysqld 15065 root      20   0 4685516 346108  19128 S   2.0  4.2  11:59.94 java ```  If I restart just the hub, all goes back to normal: nodes register and I see the queue growing in the Selenium Grid web console.      ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell I know you need to reproduce the problem but I can't share my whole application: it's not just a script and it needs a lot of work to be set up (tomcat, mysql, user data etc.) ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Could not start a new session.

I've tracked it to  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/dotnet/src/webdriver/WebElement.cs#L188  Not sure what cames here, as it's almost impossible to reproduce, but pretty clearly there could come kind of exception or another kind of unexpected message and cast fails, so I recommend changing this part of the code to something like: var res = bool.TryParse(commandResponse.Value, out bool result); return res ? result : false;  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Observed in ~1/100000 cases so there is no simple way to do this. Code used when observed: new WebDriverWait(driver, new TimeSpan(0, 0, 30)).Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(by)); The checked element is a button in the dropdown menu which might be caught in a kind of ""construction"" state so it's possible that called js doesn't exist and returns an 'undefined' result. ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell System.InvalidCastException : Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Boolean'.  --InvalidCastException    at OpenQA.Selenium.WebElement.get_Displayed()    at SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.ExpectedConditions.c__DisplayClass20_0.b__0(IWebDriver driver)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.DefaultWait`1.Until[TResult](Func`2 condition, CancellationToken token)    at OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.DefaultWait`1.Until[TResult](Func`2 condition) ```   ### Operating System  Azure devops  ### Selenium version  C# 4.1.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I've created a local setup for Grid 4 in my windows 10 machine,  Using Grid 4, I am able to create Grid 4 as Standalone and can see the result as below:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5030158/161896725-958734ab-28d6-46f0-a8ad-4bb3f56e18eb.png)  I can get the result as below  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5030158/161896917-038ec831-a0b0-4f10-b961-85f3ba27bff0.png)  But when I try to create Grid in classic way i.e. Hub and Nodes, both are in same machine, hub and node are getting created but node are not registering to hub. Below is the command to create Hub: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5030158/161897462-4a569b3c-b7d8-42c4-a1bf-190868c685e0.png) Hub get created successfully and listening on port 4444.

I tried open ports in my systems but no luck,   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell In Windows 10 machine, have selenium jar and chrome driver in same folder and run the cli command from command prompt. selenium-server-4.1.2 ChromeDriver 100.0.4896.60 ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Node logs with log level FINEST::::  Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19044.1586] (c) Microsoft Corporation.

No matter what printing options I set up, the outcome is always the same. The priinting options do nothing.  For example when I set up PrintOptions.Orientation.LANDSCAPE the file still has portait orientation. I have removed the file before another run to make sure it's a new file.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell import io.github.bonigarcia.wdm.WebDriverManager; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import org.openqa.selenium.Pdf; import org.openqa.selenium.PrintsPage; import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeOptions; import org.openqa.selenium.print.PrintOptions;  import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.Base64;  public class PrintPageExample {      @Test     public void printPageExampleTest() throws IOException {         ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();         options.addArguments(""--headless"");         WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();         WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);         driver.get("""");          PrintsPage printer = (PrintsPage) driver;         PrintOptions printOptions = new PrintOptions();         printOptions.setOrientation(PrintOptions.Orientation.LANDSCAPE);         Pdf pdf = printer.print(printOptions);         String content = pdf.getContent();         byte[] decoded = Base64.getDecoder().decode(content);         FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(""D:\\test.pdf"");         fos.write(decoded);         fos.flush();         fos.close();          driver.quit();     } } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell There is no log ```   ### Operating System  Windows 11 Pro  ### Selenium version  Java 4.1.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

As per this documentation: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/configuration/cli_options/#matching-node-a  I've tried to do the same thing in ruby like below:  1) Started the selenium grid with this command:  ``` java -jar ./selenium-server-4.1.2.jar  hub --session-request-timeout 500 --port 4444 --tracing false  ```  2) Started Running nodes with the below commands:  ``` node a) java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --max-sessions 74 --log-level ""fine"" --port 5555  --driver-implementation ""chrome"" --override-max-sessions true --max-threads 55 --driver-configuration display-name=""$(hostname)"" stereotype='{""browserName"":""chrome"",""custom_key1"":""custom_value1""}'  node b) java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --max-sessions 74 --log-level ""fine"" --port 5556  --driver-implementation ""chrome"" --override-max-sessions true --max-threads 55 --driver-configuration display-name=""$(hostname)"" stereotype='{""browserName"":""chrome"",""custom_key2"":""custom_value2""}'  ```  Then From My Ruby Code, I've tried to connect to the node 'a' which uses custom_key1 and custom_value1 like below:  ```   options = Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options.new(args: ['start-maximized'])  caps = {""custom_key1"":""custom_value1""}  options.add_option(""my_options"",caps)  And finally trying to initialize the browser:  driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote, :url => ""http://192.168.29.141:4444"", :capabilities => options)  ```  So here Im able to get the driver but its getting randomly from the above nodes. If I pass custom_key1 and custom_value1 then I should get the browser from that node 'a' only. But However browser session is getting created in node 'b' too.

"","10192","[🐛 Bug]: C#-Selenium.WebDriver 4.1.0-AddAdditionalOption& AddAdditionalCapability method are not working properly","### What happened?  I'm trying to upgrade my `Selenium.WebDriver` from `3.141.0` to `4.1.0` version in C# DOTNET 5 With version `3.141.0` I used to create an object of `DesiredCapabilities` to setting up different capabilities   ```sh DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities(); capabilities.SetCapability(""browser"", ""chrome""); capabilities.SetCapability(""browserstack.user"", ""MY USER""); capabilities.SetCapability(""browserstack.key"", ""MY KEY""); IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(""http://localhost:4444/wd/hub""), capabilities); ``` and I got something like this received for the Selenium Grid or any other tool like BrowserStack: ```sh {   ""browserName"":""chrome"",   ""browserstack.user"":""MY USER"",   ""browserstack.key"":""MY KEY"" } ``` * NOTE ALL THE ATTRIBUTES ARE IN THE JSON ROOT. This json is read it by BrowserStack without any issue.  I know you changed the visibility of the class `DesiredCapabilities`, that is the reason I can not use it anymore.  I was checking some info about this change https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/upgrade_to_selenium_4/#addadditionalcapability-is-deprecated and it's recommended to use `AddAdditionalOption`  When I implemented the suggested code ```sh   var opts = new ChromeOptions();   opts.AddAdditionalOption(""browserstack.user"", ""MY USER"");   opts.AddAdditionalOption(""browserstack.key"", ""MY KEY"");   IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(""http://localhost:4444/wd/hub""), opts.ToCapabilities()); ``` I'm not getting those options in the JSON received in the Grid. The additional options appear when I debug the `opts` variable but those values are not sent to the Grid Server.  ```sh {   ""browserName"":""chrome"",   ""goog:chromeOptions"":{        } } ``` The issue I'm having it's because those additional options are required for BrowserStack (for Authentication and specify browsers/devices)  That is the reason my test fails when I use BrowserStack.  I know there is a deprecated method like `AddAdditionalCapability `  ```sh var opts = new ChromeOptions(); opts.AddAdditionalCapability(""browserstack.user"", ""MY USER"", true); opts.AddAdditionalCapability(""browserstack.key"", ""MY KEY"", false);  IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver( new Uri(""http://localhost:4444/wd/hub""), opts.ToCapabilities()); ``` but the same it's not working properly, I'm getting the next json in the grid server  ```sh {   ""browserName"":""chrome"",   ""goog:chromeOptions"":{     ""browserstack.key"":""MY KEY""   } } ``` NOTE the `browserstack.key` ATTRIBUTE IS NOT IN THE ROOT JSON, WHERE IS EXPECTED FOR THE BS TOOL.  1. Is this an issue? with the new version, are you planning don't allow the users to put additional options in the root? 2. All the cloud tools should have their own specific capabilities as a child in the JSON? 3. `AddAdditionalCapability ` deprecated method, should be working as same as before even with the new version? 4. Should BrowserStack and other tools instead of reading the BS capabilities from the root should read from something like this `bstack:options`  Thank you in advance.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Check the next 2 test cases using the new method `AddAdditionalOption` and the deprecated method `AddAdditionalCapability`   using System; using NUnit.Framework; using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; using OpenQA.Selenium.Remote;  namespace QAAutomationCore.Test {     class SeleniumTest     {         [Test]         public void checkAddAdditionalOption()         {             IWebDriver driver = null;             try             {                 var opts = new ChromeOptions();                 opts.AddAdditionalOption(""browserstack.user"", ""MY USER"");                 opts.AddAdditionalOption(""browserstack.key"", ""MY KEY"");                  driver = new RemoteWebDriver(                     new Uri(""http://localhost:4444/wd/hub""), opts.ToCapabilities()                 );             }             finally {                 if (driver != null) {                     driver.Quit();                 }             }         }           [Test]         public void checkAddAdditionalCapability()         {             IWebDriver driver = null;             try             {                 var opts = new ChromeOptions();                 opts.AddAdditionalCapability(""browserstack.user"", ""MY USER"", true);                 opts.AddAdditionalCapability(""browserstack.key"", ""MY KEY"", false);                  driver = new RemoteWebDriver(                     new Uri(""http://localhost:4444/wd/hub""), opts.ToCapabilities()                 );             }             finally             {                 if (driver != null)                 {                     driver.Quit();                 }             }         }      } } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Logs are shown in the description. ```   ### Operating System  WINDOWS 10 PRO / DOTNET 5  ### Selenium version  C#-Selenium.WebDriver 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

Note that if I keep a remote desktop session open it works fine with Selenium **4.1.3** and IEDriverServer **4.0.0.0**. But running without an open RDP session is not desired.  I found similar issue https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10497 and reviewed https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/ie_driver_server/ and confirmed the Windows environment and IE Selenium capabilities are setup properly. I also tried with Edge/IE11 compatibility mode and got the same problem.  Thank you in advance for your help towards resolving this issue!  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```java InternetExplorerOptions ieOptions = new InternetExplorerOptions(); ieOptions.setPlatformName(Platform.WINDOWS.name()); ieOptions.setCapability(InternetExplorerDriver.INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS, true); ieOptions.setCapability(InternetExplorerDriver.REQUIRE_WINDOW_FOCUS, false); ieOptions.setCapability(InternetExplorerDriver.ENABLE_ELEMENT_CACHE_CLEANUP, true); ieOptions.setCapability(""ignoreProtectedModeSettings"", true); ieOptions.setCapability(""IntroduceInstabilityByIgnoringProtectedModeSettings"", true); ieOptions.setCapability(""nativeEvents"", true); ieOptions.setCapability(""browserFocus"", true); ieOptions.setCapability(""ignoreZoomSetting"", true); ieOptions.setCapability(""requireWindowFocus"", true); System.setProperty(""webdriver.ie.driver"", System.getProperty(""user.dir"") + File.separator + ""driver\\IEDriverServer_4.0.0.0.exe""); WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver(ieOptions); ```   ### Relevant log output (DEBUG log level)  ```shell 2022-04-19 16:45:19.937 DEBUGi.n.u.i.l.InternalLoggerFactory:63 -

I'm running Selenium UI tests on a web application from a Windows Server 2019 machine. I'm using Chrome with ChromeDriver.  Most of the time everything works fine. But for some reasons I randomly get the error :  ``` OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriverTimeoutException : timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: 60.000   (Session info: headless chrome=101.0.4951.54) ```  I tried to increase the `PageLoad` timeout with a higher value. However, I'm still getting the exact same error message :  `_driver.Manage().Timeouts().PageLoad = 120;`  I'm running many tests. But in general, I'm only getting this issue on a single test. This does not affect the all tests run. One or two in a total of 50 most of the time.  From what I've seen most of people solved this issue by adding the `--disable-gpu` on the driver initialization. However, I'm already using this option, and the problem still remains.  Any help would be much appreciated.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Below are the options I'm using for the ChromeDriver :  options.AddArgument(""--no-sandbox""); options.AddArgument($""--lang=en""); options.AddUserProfilePreference(""download.default_directory"", ""C:\\Users\\temp\\""); options.AddUserProfilePreference(""profile.default_content_setting_values.automatic_downloads"", 1); options.AddArgument(""--headless""); options.AddArgument(""window-size=1920,1080""); options.AddArgument(""--disable-gpu""); options.AddArgument(""--incognito""); ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Below is the test output while the problem occurs :  OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriverTimeoutException : timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: 60.000   (Session info: headless chrome=101.0.4951.54) ```   ### Operating System  Windows Server 2019  ### Selenium version  .NET 5.0 C# 9.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I'm playing with performance metrics and I can see some incosistency.   I have used example code from documentation for C#: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/bidirectional/chrome_devtools/#collect-performance-metrics  This code shows me similar metrics as the one for Java so I assume that probably this code is correct.  But then I also checked tests for this feature: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/dotnet/test/common/DevTools/DevToolsPerformanceTest.cs  There you generate metrics in another way so I tried it and I've got different metric results which doesn't seem to be correct.  What is the correct way to use the feature? If it's the one from documentation, then I'm not sure if the tests in DevToolsPerformanceTest.cs are correct.  Below you can see two tests. TaskMetricsTestAsync1 is based on the documentation (and I believe it shows correct results) and TaskMetricsTestAsync2 is created based on tests from DevToolsPerformanceTest.cs.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell using NUnit.Framework; using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; using OpenQA.Selenium.DevTools; using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Performance = OpenQA.Selenium.DevTools.V96.Performance; using DevTools = OpenQA.Selenium.DevTools.V96;  namespace TestowyProjekt.Selenium4 {     class PerformanceMetrics     {         IWebDriver driver;          [SetUp]         public void Setup()         {             driver = new ChromeDriver();         }           [Test]         public async Task TaskMetricsTestAsync1()         {             DevToolsSession session = ((IDevTools)driver).GetDevToolsSession();              await session.SendCommand(new Performance.EnableCommandSettings());             Performance.GetMetricsCommandResponse metricsResponse =                 await session.SendCommand(                     new Performance.GetMetricsCommandSettings());              driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(""http://fakestore.testelka.pl"");                           var metrics = metricsResponse.Metrics;             foreach (Performance.Metric metric in metrics)             {                 Console.WriteLine(""{0} = {1}"", metric.Name, metric.Value);             }         }           [Test]         public async Task TaskMetricsTestAsync2()         {             DevToolsSession session = ((IDevTools)driver).GetDevToolsSession();             DevTools.DevToolsSessionDomains domains = session.GetVersionSpecificDomains();              await domains.Performance.Enable(new Performance.EnableCommandSettings());              driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(""https://fakestore.testelka.pl"");              DevTools.Performance.GetMetricsCommandResponse response = await domains.Performance.GetMetrics();             DevTools.Performance.Metric[] metrics = response.Metrics;             await domains.Performance.Disable();              foreach (var metric in metrics)             {                 Console.WriteLine(metric.Name + "" = "" + metric.Value);             }         }           [TearDown]         public void QuitDriver()         {             driver.Quit();         }     } } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Results for TaskMetricsTestAsync1:  Timestamp = 6002,033808 AudioHandlers = 0 Documents = 2 Frames = 1 JSEventListeners = 0 LayoutObjects = 6 MediaKeySessions = 0 MediaKeys = 0 Nodes = 8 Resources = 0 ContextLifecycleStateObservers = 2 V8PerContextDatas = 1 WorkerGlobalScopes = 0 UACSSResources = 0 RTCPeerConnections = 0 ResourceFetchers = 2 AdSubframes = 0 DetachedScriptStates = 0 ArrayBufferContents = 0 LayoutCount = 0 RecalcStyleCount = 0 LayoutDuration = 0 RecalcStyleDuration = 0 DevToolsCommandDuration = 1,4E-05 ScriptDuration = 0 V8CompileDuration = 0 TaskDuration = 1,9E-05 TaskOtherDuration = 5E-06 ThreadTime = 5,3E-05 ProcessTime = 0,21875 JSHeapUsedSize = 1034060 JSHeapTotalSize = 2080768 FirstMeaningfulPaint = 0 DomContentLoaded = 5997,834006 NavigationStart = 5997,506084  Results for TaskMetricsTestAsync2:  Timestamp = 6037,5065 AudioHandlers = 0 Documents = 3 Frames = 2 JSEventListeners = 95 LayoutObjects = 823 MediaKeySessions = 0 MediaKeys = 0 Nodes = 1673 Resources = 112 ContextLifecycleStateObservers = 5 V8PerContextDatas = 1 WorkerGlobalScopes = 0 UACSSResources = 0 RTCPeerConnections = 0 ResourceFetchers = 3 AdSubframes = 0 DetachedScriptStates = 0 ArrayBufferContents = 0 LayoutCount = 16 RecalcStyleCount = 20 LayoutDuration = 0,059913 RecalcStyleDuration = 0,027851 DevToolsCommandDuration = 0,00104 ScriptDuration = 0,167962 V8CompileDuration = 0,001348 TaskDuration = 0,351894 TaskOtherDuration = 0,09378 ThreadTime = 0,264857 ProcessTime = 0,5625 JSHeapUsedSize = 3160844 JSHeapTotalSize = 4845568 FirstMeaningfulPaint = 0 DomContentLoaded = 6037,381635 NavigationStart = 6036,648397 ```   ### Operating System  Windows 11 Pro  ### Selenium version  C# 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10268","[🐛 Bug]: INSTALL_SCHEMES and setuptools 60+","### What happened?  I'm packaging python-selenium in ALTLinux.  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#distutils-deprecated: > The entire distutils package is deprecated, to be removed in Python 3.12. Its functionality for specifying package builds has already been completely replaced by third-party packages setuptools and packaging, and most other commonly used APIs are available elsewhere in the standard library (such as platform, shutil, subprocess or sysconfig). There are no plans to migrate any other functionality from distutils, and applications that are using other functions should plan to make private copies of the code. Refer to PEP 632 for discussion.  setuptools is the new home for distutils and from 60+ setuptools enables its own copy of distutils by default. With this change, the hack in setup.py of selenium no longer works since INSTALL_SCHEMES are no longer considered as scheme source (a scheme is taken from sysconfig). See https://github.com/pypa/distutils/pull/79 for details.  ```python for scheme in INSTALL_SCHEMES.values():                                               scheme['data'] = scheme['purelib'] ```  This led to the wrong installation path for data (depend on selected installation scheme), e.g. ``` /usr/selenium/webdriver/remote/getAttribute.js /usr/selenium/webdriver/remote/isDisplayed.js ``` while the expected path is `/usr/lib64/python3/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/`. Note: even I have too old selenium I see exactly the same code in master.  For my distro I dropped the hack and added cli option `--install-data` for `python setup.py install`.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell 1) install setuptools 60+ 2) `/usr/bin/python3 setup.py install --skip-build --root=/usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot --force` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell running install_data creating /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium creating /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver creating /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/firefox creating /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/firefox /x86 copying py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/x86/x_ignore_nofocus.so -> /usr/src/tmp/python3- module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/firefox/x86 creating /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/firefox /amd64 copying py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/amd64/x_ignore_nofocus.so -> /usr/src/tmp/python 3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/firefox/amd64 creating /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-selenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/remote copying py/selenium/webdriver/remote/getAttribute.js -> /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-se lenium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/remote copying py/selenium/webdriver/remote/isDisplayed.js -> /usr/src/tmp/python3-module-sel enium-buildroot/usr/selenium/webdriver/remote ```   ### Operating System  ALTLinux  ### Selenium version  3.0.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  0  ### What are the browser driver(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  0  ### Are you using Selenium Grid?  _No response_","closed","I-defect,","stanislavlevin","2022-01-20T10:14:50Z","2022-03-10T00:09:34Z"

"","10038","[🐛 Bug]: Selenium pauses execution of code when using Remote DevTools","### What happened?  I'm launching an instance of ChromeDriver with the remote debugging port option set and I can access the remote dev tools just fine however whenever I do, the script just pauses execution and sits there on the page. There are no errors in the console or in the browser and there are no indicators that anything has gone wrong. One oddity I noticed was that if I repeatedly scroll up and down on the page, the script will continue so long as I continue scrolling.  This issue has already been reported here (#9759) but lacked details so I figured I'd open a new issue. I'm not really sure what to make of all this or even where I should post this issue so I'm just starting here. I'll be happy to file an issue elsewhere if someone can point me in the right direction.  **Steps to reproduce:**  1. Run the example script below 2. Go to http://localhost:9000 3. Click on the `React Image Gallery` link 4. Wait a bit and you should not see the script doing anything 5. Rapidly scroll up and down and the script should continue execution 6.

"","9974","[🐛 Bug]: Selenium4: Handled exception stacktraces in log output","### What happened?  I'm currently trying to upgrade from Selenium 3.141.59 to 4.0.0 and I've encountered some issues, one of which is described in the following.  I try to find an element where I know it might not exist depending on the previous steps in the application, so I surrounded it with a try/catch block where I catch _NoSuchElementException_ as well as _TimeoutException_ since I use a _FluentWait_ to poll for a specified amount of time. When the element was found everything is fine. However, if it's not found, the exception handling occurs as intended and the test progresses accordingly, BUT the stacktraces of both aforementioned exceptions are still written to the log, even though I never specifically output any of them myself. In the exception handling I just say catch exception xyz and do nothing.  I've also discovered that stacktraces showing in logs only occurs when using the listener we've implemented that waits for an element to be present etc before .findBy(..) is executed, since the application can be a tad bit slow at times (especially when debugging locally). When I don't use the listener but copy its code to the test code itself, everything works as expected..exception handling occurs and no stacktraces of exceptions that were caught show up on the log.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  DriverEventListener: ``` public class DriverEventListener implements WebDriverListener {     private void waitForElement(WebDriver driver, By selector) {          Wait wait = new FluentWait(driver).withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(4))             .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(1)).ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);          if (selector != null) {             wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(selector));             wait.until(driver1 -> {                 WebElement element = driver1.findElement(selector);                 return (element != null && element.isEnabled() ? element : null);             });         }     }          @Override     public void beforeFindElement(WebDriver driver, By locator) {         waitForElement(driver, locator);     } } ```  The following code works fine (no exception stacktraces, NO listener used): ``` public class ThisWorksFine {     public static void main(String[] args) {         System.setProperty(""webdriver.gecko.driver"", ""D:/Workspaces/selenium/geckodriver-v0.30.0/geckodriver.exe"");         WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();          driver.get(""https://google.com"");          Wait wait = new FluentWait(driver).withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(4))             .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(1)).ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);          try {             By selector = By.id(""username""); // this ID doesn't exist on given page             wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(selector));             wait.until(driver1 -> {                 WebElement element = driver1.findElement(selector);                 return (element != null && element.isEnabled() ? element : null);             });         } catch (NoSuchElementException | TimeoutException ex) {             System.out.println(""Some exception handling happens"");         } finally {             driver.quit();         }     } } ```  With output: ``` SLF4J: Failed to load class ""org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"".

error in both cases started occurring upon upgrading from Selenium 3.141.59 to 4.0.0)  As you can see, in the given example above where we use the listener, exception handling occurs as expected, but the stacktraces of the caught exceptions still show up in the logs.   If the behavior described above (stacktraces printed to logs even when exception is handled) is the intended behavior for the setup with the listener indeed, is there any way to suppress log outputs in case the exception is handled (but ofc output it if an unintended TimeoutException etc occured at some other point)? Also, why do stacktraces occur in the setup with the listener whereas everything is as expected when not using the listener but identical code?

I'm Automating an Website in my organization using selenium Java in IE Mode on Edge, everything is working fine until I clicked this button it is showing blank webpage dialog pop window but when I tried this flow from beginning by manually clicking on that button it is going to open a new window the redirects to the payment page (_See 3rd image_ ) but that is not happening in automation and I've noticed that when I had start my application it displays login page that is working on **IE 11 mode** compatibility after performing login the home page is opened that is in **IE mode 5** and rest of the flow continuous in IE mode 5 only, till that button that is bringing a new webpage dialog popup window, I've checked that payment window is running on **IE 11 mode** while running the flow manually. So my question is the IE driver not able to switch modes from **IE 5 to IE 11** but at the beginning the mode got changed from **IE 11 to IE 5** .  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109272734/178983064-6783db43-2a51-4f16-980a-69b577307af4.png)   In this page that payment button is present, this page is running on **IE 5 Mode**  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109272734/178984485-1101c14c-c9d6-4333-840c-523993b14cda.png)  when I'm trying to do manually from the beginning and come to this page and click on the payment button then it opens new window that is running on **IE 11 Mode**  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109272734/178985056-0f4f85fc-1d22-443f-9d38-7958cea8dbf3.png)  But in the automation when I try to click on the payment button, then it is showing blank webpage dialog popup window as you can see in the first image.

When I investigated why it is unable to serialize the object to JSON, I found `httpRequest.data` contains content of the specified firefox profile which is about 200MB in size and it reaches the maximum length of the string. However, the profile should be used for the browser, not be attached to the request body. Is it a bug, or I'm doing something wrong ?

"","10599","[🐛 Bug]: IEDriver.WindowHandles does not return all handles","### What happened?  I updated Selenium to 4. I test legacy app that runs only on IE. Now IE will be closed down and I need to switch to MS Egde in capability mode. My tests during execution need to switch to new browser windows and uses function IWebDriver.WindowHandles to do it (code below).  COmparing to Selenium 3 I had to add new options for a driver to run test on Edge like this:  ``` var options = new InternetExplorerOptions(); options.AttachToEdgeChrome = true; options.EdgeExecutablePath = @""\msedge.exe"";  ``` Then I use code like this to switch between browser windows when user open new browser window in tested application:  ``` public Context SwitchToNewIEWindow(string windowTitle, bool isEqual = true) { for (int i = 0; i < context.GetTimeout().Seconds; i++) { try { var ieWindowHandlers = context.GetDriver().WindowHandles; foreach(var handler in ieWindowHandlers) { var window = context.GetDriver().SwitchTo().Window(handler); bool condition = isEqual ? window.Title == windowTitle : window.Title.Contains(windowTitle); if (condition) { context.SetDriver(window); context.SetCurrentWindow(windowTitle); return context; } } } catch (Exception) { context.Wait(1); } } throw new Exception($""No window found with title: {windowTitle}"");      }  ``` In Selenium 3 everything works fine and WindowHandles function returns 2 handles. In Selenium 4 and IEDriver in Edge mode this function returns only 1 handle of main browser window. In my case waiting a few seconds ( as it is recommended in guidelines) does not change anything. Even after a minute I still get only handle of first window. Any suggestions how to make it work properly again in Selenium 4.  I am aware of issue #8868 but this one was closed. In my opinion the error still exists and should be fixed somehow.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell public Context SwitchToNewIEWindow(string windowTitle, bool isEqual = true) { for (int i = 0; i < context.GetTimeout().Seconds; i++) { try { var ieWindowHandlers = context.GetDriver().WindowHandles; foreach(var handler in ieWindowHandlers) { var window = context.GetDriver().SwitchTo().Window(handler); bool condition = isEqual ? window.Title == windowTitle : window.Title.Contains(windowTitle); if (condition) { context.SetDriver(window); context.SetCurrentWindow(windowTitle); return context; } } } catch (Exception) { context.Wait(1); } } throw new Exception($""No window found with title: {windowTitle}"");      } ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell var ieWindowHandlers = context.GetDriver().WindowHandles; return 1 handle of first browser window and ignore any other browser window that is open within application. ``` I have also tried to use NewWindow function to open new window within my test but unfortunately this function open IE browser instead of new Edge window whitch I think is another error :   context.GetDriver().SwitchTo().NewWindow(WindowType.Window);   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  Selenium.WebDriver 4.1,1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

In any advanced framework or libary has this feature  When I filtering the table with the filter textbox elemnt, the test fails.  First I clear the text in th filterring text box elemnt, because I dont want to use the defult value , to filter. Then I send keys - the filterring value that I want. Whereupon, the text in the text box value is chaining.  For example : the default value in the text box elemt is : `Shahar`. I clear that value and send key with the value : `AutomationDeveloper`. But, react using the default value with the value I sent using the SendKeys() method.So, in the filtering box the value is : `ShaharAutomationDeveloper`  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell You can support the default field attribute and enusre the send keys method or clear method (I think the problem  is in the sendKeysmethod) works with new frameworks or libaries ablilities.

Previously I was using this code snippet on a Mac and everything was working fine. When switching to Linux I changed the geckodriver binary to be the one for Linux. But I got this issue where it says it doesn't find the marionette port. I saw this thread on stackoverflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72374955/failed-to-read-marionette-port-when-running-selenium-geckodriver-firefox-a](url) which I thought might be related to my problem. So I tried to run the script in super user mode. It didn't change anything  [EDIT] I installed Ubuntu about 10 days ago from an iso image from ubuntu.com: [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=22.04&architecture=amd64](url) and Firefox was already installed with it. I downloaded geckodriver from [https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases](url) and copied it in some directory in my project. I also tried to put it at some moment in /usr/bin but it didn't change anything. I tried right now by changing geckodriver path to be absolute: ""/home/clement/Desktop/mobilite-electrique.tech/bin"".

"","10218","[🐛 Bug]: edge in SELENIUM_BROWSER environment variable leads to web driver not building due to error","### What happened?  I set up the environment variable `SELENIUM_BROWSER`, which includes the names of the browsers I want to run tests against. The values I use are the Browser names enumerated [here](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_Browser.html). As far as I was experiencing, adding multiple browser names and seperating them by comma works fine. So, if I run tests against Firefox, Chrome and Opera, the value of the environment variable `SELENIUM_BROWSER` is `firefox,chrome,opera`. That works fine. However, as soon as I add `edge` to the environment variable, an error occurs as the web driver wasn't successfully built when trying to run the tests in Microsoft Edge. I also tried entering different names, such as `MicrosoftEdge` or `msedge`, but with no success.  However, when using an older selenium-webdriver version (`4.0.0−beta.3`), all tests run through.  Thank you in advance for looking into this.

"","10706","[🐛 Bug]: rubyzip usage not compatible with rubyzip 3.x","### What happened?  I haven't actually verified this bug myself, but a recent `bundle install` gave the following warning: ``` Post-install message from rubyzip: RubyZip 3.0 is coming! **********************  The public API of some Rubyzip classes has been modernized to use named parameters for optional arguments. Please check your usage of the following classes:   * `Zip::File`   * `Zip::Entry`   * `Zip::InputStream`   * `Zip::OutputStream`  Please ensure that your Gemfiles and .gemspecs are suitably restrictive to avoid an unexpected breakage when 3.0 is released (e.g. ~> 2.3.0). See https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip for details. The Changelog also lists other enhancements and bugfixes that have been implemented since version 2.3.0. ```  I checked my **Gemfile.lock** and saw that `selenium-webdriver` was pulling in `rubyzip` as a dependency and was not locking the version of `rubyzip` as suggested by the message. The root definition of this dependency is here: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/bb3b82e7891cdbe8bf75680fdc3c2a73a4d58f21/rb/selenium-webdriver.gemspec#L50  I took the liberty at the code in this repo, and I _think_ the only place that needs to be changed to handle `rubyzip` 3.x is for this line https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/bb3b82e7891cdbe8bf75680fdc3c2a73a4d58f21/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/zipper.rb#L78 to be changed to  ```ruby Zip::File.open(zip_path, create: true, &blk) ```  However I think this would break compatibility with `rubyzip` 1.x and 2.x. I'll leave it to you to decide whether to temporarily lock to the older version, drop support for older versions of `rubyzip` in some future release, or try to come up with a nice way to handle both!  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell I've not tested this because our Gemfile.lock already has rubyzip locked to 2.3.0, but I think you could reproduce this right now as follows:  1. Create a fresh ruby project 2. Add `selenium-webdriver` to a Gemfile 3. Run `bundle install` which will pull in the latest versions of `selenium-webdriver` and `rubyzip` 4. Use some functionality that utilises the `zip` or `zip_file` methods of `Selenium::WebDriver::Zipper` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell N/A ```   ### Operating System  macOS  ### Selenium version  Ruby 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I have problem with clicking on a button using selenium in **Chrome** browser only.  **Scenario:** In our web application there is a scenario where logged in user can choose the products, add it to cart, select payment methods and Click on **Proceed to Payment**. On clicking **Proceed to Payment** to secure payment, it should open a new child window with option to login to the payment method and process payments.   In the above scenario, I have issue with Click():  After selecting Google pay radio, when I click on _Proceed to Payment_ Nothing happens, no errors thrown. I can't see the child window to Sign in to _**Google pay**_. (Tried all the possible ways - Selenium Click() & JS click, Keyboard inputs & Actions). Surprisingly in the same automation session if I click that button manually it is opening sign in to Google  child window. I have checked if there frames nothing is there. Don't understand why the button press doesn't open child window using automation methods. click doesn't work, though the button returns true for isDisplayed(), is Enabled & clickable .   This issue happens only in chrome browser. Other browsers open the Google sign in child window when I click on Proceed To Payment. `   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell I cant share my application flow.

The problematic code is https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/devtools/DevTools.java#L99:  ```java     // Grab the first ""page"" type, and glom on to that.     // TODO: Find out which one might be the current one     TargetID targetId = infos.stream()       .filter(info -> ""page"".equals(info.getType()))       .map(TargetInfo::getTargetId)       .findAny()       .orElseThrow(() -> new DevToolsException(""Unable to find target id of a page"")); ```  Actually, we can easily pick the right `TargetID` by matching it with `WebDriver.getWindowHandle()`.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell @Test   void useDevToolsInWrongWindow() {     WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();     ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();     driver.navigate().to(""https://duckduckgo.com"");     driver.executeScript(""window.open()"");      DevTools devTools = driver.getDevTools();     devTools.createSessionIfThereIsNotOne();     devTools.send(Emulation.setAutoDarkModeOverride(Optional.of(true)));      // Expected: the first window (duckduckgo.com) becomes dark     // Actual: the second window (empty) becomes dark     driver.quit();   } ```   ### The fix  Here is my pull request: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/10811   ### Operating System  MacOS (no matter)  ### Selenium version  4.3.0 Java  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10416","[🐛 Bug]: OpenTelemetry tracing fails to start with NoSuchMethodError","### What happened?  I followed the instructions from `java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar info tracing` to start selenium with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger but I got an exception at startup.  ``` About Tracing =============  Selenium Grid ships with support for distributed tracing, backed by the OpenTelemetry APIs. This allows admins and devops engineers to trace the flow of control through the Grid for each and every command.  To enable this support, you must first provide a ""Tracer"" implementation that should be used. We use OpenTelemtry's own mechanisms for selecting the implementations, so if your chosen tracing library supports this you should be good to go. If you are using the standalone selenium jar, updating the classpath to contain your tracer can be done using the `--ext` flag to selenium.  As a worked example, using Jaeger as the tracing library and running on macOS:     java -Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger \        -Dotel.exporter.jaeger.endpoint=http://localhost:14250 \        -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=selenium-standalone \        -jar selenium.jar \        --ext $(coursier fetch -p \           io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger:1.9.1 \           io.grpc:grpc-netty:1.41.0) \        standalone   This example uses a tool called ""coursier"" to generate a full classpath, but you can also write this manually. When started this way, the selenium server will inform you that it has found a tracer on stdout.   ```  Maybe some dependency is missing?  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell java -Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger -Dotel.exporter.jaeger.endpoint=http://localhost:14250 -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=selenium-standalone -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar --ext $(coursier fetch -p io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger:1.9.1 io.grpc:grpc-netty:1.41.0) standalone ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell 11:35:19.866 INFO [LogManager$RootLogger.log] - Using the system default encoding 11:35:19.884 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException         at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)         at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)         at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Bootstrap.runMain(Bootstrap.java:77)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:70) Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: io.opentelemetry.api.metrics.LongCounter.bind(Lio/opentelemetry/api/common/Attributes;)Lio/opentelemetry/api/metrics/BoundLongCounter;         at io.opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporter.(OkHttpGrpcExporter.java:87)         at io.opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporterBuilder.build(OkHttpGrpcExporterBuilder.java:142)         at io.opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.JaegerGrpcSpanExporterBuilder.build(JaegerGrpcSpanExporterBuilder.java:92)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.SpanExporterConfiguration.configureJaeger(SpanExporterConfiguration.java:179)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.SpanExporterConfiguration.configureExporter(SpanExporterConfiguration.java:94)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.SpanExporterConfiguration.lambda$configureSpanExporters$0(SpanExporterConfiguration.java:80)         at java.util.stream.Collectors.lambda$toMap$58(Collectors.java:1321)         at java.util.stream.ReduceOps$3ReducingSink.accept(ReduceOps.java:169)         at java.util.HashMap$KeySpliterator.forEachRemaining(HashMap.java:1556)         at java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.copyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:482)         at java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.wrapAndCopyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:472)         at java.util.stream.ReduceOps$ReduceOp.evaluateSequential(ReduceOps.java:708)         at java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.evaluate(AbstractPipeline.java:234)         at java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.collect(ReferencePipeline.java:566)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.SpanExporterConfiguration.configureSpanExporters(SpanExporterConfiguration.java:75)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.TracerProviderConfiguration.configureTracerProvider(TracerProviderConfiguration.java:63)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdkBuilder.build(AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdkBuilder.java:192)         at io.opentelemetry.sdk.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdk.initialize(AutoConfiguredOpenTelemetrySdk.java:29)         at org.openqa.selenium.remote.tracing.opentelemetry.OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer(OpenTelemetryTracer.java:77)         at org.openqa.selenium.remote.tracing.opentelemetry.OpenTelemetryTracer.getInstance(OpenTelemetryTracer.java:59)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.log.LoggingOptions.getTracer(LoggingOptions.java:94)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.commands.Standalone.createHandlers(Standalone.java:117)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridServerCommand.asServer(TemplateGridServerCommand.java:41)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.commands.Standalone.execute(Standalone.java:214)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.TemplateGridCommand.lambda$configure$4(TemplateGridCommand.java:129)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.launch(Main.java:83)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.go(Main.java:57)         at org.openqa.selenium.grid.Main.main(Main.java:42)         ... 6 more ```   ### Operating System  Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS  ### Selenium version  Java 4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","9959","[🐛 Bug]: Session still active after driver.quit() is called","### What happened?  I deployed Selenium 4.0.0 GRID (commit hash: 50fecc4c098b3f80b64b9cb3129ace6bbf07065e) into a Kubernetes cluster by applying k8s-deployment-full-grid.yaml.  I created a test in a NodeJS/Typescript/Cucumber environment. It navigates to a site, performs a login procedure and gets forwarded to an another page.  The driver is built as follows:  `    this.driver = new Builder()       .usingServer(env.SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL)       .forBrowser('chrome')       .setChromeOptions(new Options().headless().windowSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080}).addArguments('--no-sandbox'))       .build(); `  The test executes perfectly, all elements are found, the sequence completes. At the end of the test suite the session is closed by: `     await this.driver.close();     await this.driver.quit();`` ` The test ends, but when I query the /status endpoint on the Selenium Router I see the chrome's session slot still being used with the same session ID I just terminated.  This session remains there  indefinitely until / I redeploy the services.  I have attached wireshark logs from the chrome and the router nodes, also application logs: [hanging_session_wireshark.zip](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/files/7382491/hanging_session_wireshark.zip [hanging_session_app_log.zip](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/files/7382515/hanging_session_app_log.zip) )   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell 1) Use the aforementioned k8s deployment yaml to deploy the solution into a k8s cluster. 2) Create a chrome session by building a driver described in the previous section 3) You do not have to perform any browser action 4) Quit the session either with close()/quit() or simply quit(). 5) Check the router/session page to see the session being stuck. ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Relevant logs are attached in the first block (app logs / wireshark logs) ```   ### Operating System  Linux  ### Selenium version  4.0.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?  chrome / firefox  ### What are the browser driver(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","9994","[🐛 Bug]: WebDriver doesn't have local or session storage","### What happened?  I created a Firefox WebDriver in Python and loaded a number of different web pages.  I looked in my browser and saw a number of local and session storage variables in the Developer Tools.  When I call ""driver.execute_script(""return localStorage.key(0)"")"" it usually returns a localStorage value.  But this command returns nothing for any other index than 0, and it returns nothing for sessionStorage.  It seems very likely that Selenium doesn't have the local or session storage variables.  Why is this, and how can we obtain them like a normal browser?  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell driver.execute_script(""return localStorage.key(1)"") ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell >>> driver.execute_script(""return localStorage.key(0)"") 'algoliasearch-client-js' >>> driver.execute_script(""return localStorage.key(1)"") >>> ```   ### Operating System  Ubuntu Server 21.04  ### Selenium version  Python 3  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

Because the application is breaking that mean the code is working but it is just not adding the response header.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell WebDriver webDriver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions);                 DevTools devTools = ((ChromeDriver) webDriver).getDevTools();                 devTools.createSession();        			devTools.send(Fetch.enable(Optional.empty(), Optional.empty()));        			String response = ""{\""status\"": \""SUCCESS\""}"";          devTools.addListener(Fetch.requestPaused(), req -> {             String url = req.getRequest().getUrl();             if (url.equals(""https://***** Hidden ******"")) {                 List corsHeaders = new ArrayList();                 corsHeaders.add(new HeaderEntry(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"", ""https://*** Hidden ****""));                 corsHeaders.add(new HeaderEntry(""Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"", ""true""));                  devTools.send(Fetch.fulfillRequest                         (                                 req.getRequestId(),                                 200,                                 Optional.of(corsHeaders),                                 Optional.empty(),                                 Optional.of(Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(response.getBytes())),                                 Optional.of(""OK"")                         )                 );             } else {                 devTools.send(Fetch.continueRequest(                         req.getRequestId(),                         Optional.of(url),                         Optional.of(req.getRequest().getMethod()),                         req.getRequest().getPostData(),                         req.getResponseHeaders(),                         Optional.empty()));             }         }); ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Chrome screenshot where not a single response header is added and the application is breaking ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28785545/172136414-907aaa57-4d9f-48e3-883b-d1ce569d00cd.png)  ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10489","[🐛 Bug]: I am getting ""WebDriverException: Unable to parse:"" when using Selenium Select.selectByVisualText","### What happened?  I am having a test suite with a parallel setup to run test classes in parallel. The parallel setup is not an issue and it's 100% working fine. After upgrading from selenium `4.0.0-beta-3` to `4.1.2`, I often get a `WebDriverException: Unable to parse:` exception. Every time the exception triggers, the stack trace points to the same line of code that uses Selenium [Select.selectByVisualText](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.html#selectByVisibleText(java.lang.String)).  I even tried to run the suite in the serial execution setup and it triggers the same exception with a different test class but referring to the same utility we have that uses the Selenium `Select.selectByVisualText`  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  Use the Selenium [Select.selectByVisualText](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Select.html#selectByVisibleText(java.lang.String)) to select an option from a drop-down select. I would suggest having a test suite of 10 or so doing the same actions so that you have a higher probability to trigger this exception. Or, maybe one class with a for loop that calls the `Select.selectByVisualText` method would be easier.  I am not sure if this bug can be resolved without this Feature Proposal being implemented  - #9792  ### Relevant log output  ```shell WebDriverException: Unable to parse:  Build info: version:

In this case, we have selenium grid and the browser nodes' instances set up in the Kubernetes cluster, there are 3 browser types consisting of chrome, edge and firefox.

Navigate with selenium to `http://prices.shufersal.co.il/`, then try clicking the links in the table: ```shell    const scanItems = async () => {     onDownloadStart();     const items = await global.driver.findElements(By.css('.webgrid tbody tr a'));     console.log(`Found ${items.length} items`);     for (const item of items) {         try {             // await item.click();             await sleep(300);             increaseDownloadedCount();         } catch (e) {             console.log('Bad item found, skip', e);         }     } }  '--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage', 'log-path=chromedriver.log',         '--window-size=1920,1080',         '--ignore-certificate-errors',         'safebrowsing-disable-extension-blacklist',         'safebrowsing-disable-download-protection',         '--disable-logging',         '--disable-gpu',         '--disable-extensions',         '--log-level=2',         '--no-sandbox',         '--headless'];   Uncommenting `await item.click();` triggers a memory leak. `item.click()` performs a file download on a specific web page. ```   ### Relevant log output (log level was set to 3) ```Starting Selenium Grid Standalone... 09:59:53.915 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 09:59:53.921 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 09:59:54.772 INFO [NodeOptions.getSessionFactories] - Detected 4 available processors 09:59:54.844 INFO [NodeOptions.report] - Adding chrome for {""browserVersion"": ""103.0"",""se:noVncPort"": 7900,""browserName"": ""chrome"",""platformName"": ""LINUX"",""se:vncEnabled"": true} 1 times 09:59:54.867 INFO [Node.] - Binding additional locator mechanisms: relative, name, id 09:59:54.894 INFO [GridModel.setAvailability] - Switching Node 6d373c28-d167-4df3-bcb9-fb276f332a64 (uri: http://172.18.0.5:4444) from DOWN to UP 09:59:54.895 INFO [LocalDistributor.add] - Added node 6d373c28-d167-4df3-bcb9-fb276f332a64 at http://172.18.0.5:4444.

Hi,  i think i found a bug in the latest 4.1.1 Java Version:  I have following piece of code working with v3.x:  ``` FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions(); FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(); String downloadDir = ""/path/to/my/dir/""; profile.setPreference(""browser.download.dir"", downloadDir); options.addPreference(""browser.download.dir"", downloadDir); options.setLogLevel(FirefoxDriverLogLevel.TRACE); LoggingPreferences logs = new LoggingPreferences(); Level level = Level.ALL; logs.enable(LogType.DRIVER, level); logs.enable(LogType.CLIENT, level); logs.enable(LogType.BROWSER, level); logs.enable(LogType.SERVER, level); logs.enable(LogType.PERFORMANCE, level); logs.enable(LogType.PROFILER, level); options.setCapability(CapabilityType.LOGGING_PREFS, logs); options.setProfile(profile); new FirefoxDriver(options); ```  as said, this works with v3.x, but in v4.x the profile is not transferred to firefox, the configuration entry `browser.download.dir` remains unset. and if i remove the line ``` options.setCapability(CapabilityType.LOGGING_PREFS,  logs); ``` then it works fine again.  how can it be that this breaks the profile?  am i doing something wrong here?  i see also the same behaviour using a grid.  many thanks Michael  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions(); FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile(); String downloadDir = ""/path/to/my/dir/""; profile.setPreference(""browser.download.dir"", downloadDir); options.addPreference(""browser.download.dir"", downloadDir); options.setLogLevel(FirefoxDriverLogLevel.TRACE); LoggingPreferences logs = new LoggingPreferences(); Level level = Level.ALL; logs.enable(LogType.DRIVER, level); logs.enable(LogType.CLIENT, level); logs.enable(LogType.BROWSER, level); logs.enable(LogType.SERVER, level); logs.enable(LogType.PERFORMANCE, level); logs.enable(LogType.PROFILER, level); options.setCapability(CapabilityType.LOGGING_PREFS, logs); options.setProfile(profile); new FirefoxDriver(options); ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell 1641376474543	geckodriver	INFO	Listening on 127.0.0.1:51609 1641376480277	mozrunner::runner	INFO	Running command: ""C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe"" ""--marionette"" ""-no-remote"" ""-profile"" ""C:\\Users\\moossenm\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\rust_mozprofileJd5B9U"" 1641376480749	Marionette	INFO	Marionette enabled console.warn: SearchSettings: ""get: No settings file exists, new profile?""

"","10211","[🐛 Bug]: Unable to pre-load cookies with execute_cdp_cmd('Network.setCookie') in AWS Lambda/ECS","### What happened?  Hi,  I'm running Selenium in AWS Lambda on an ECS container image. I have a use-case where I have to initialise a dummy website first (example google.com) to be able to add custom cookies then open another website where I preload these cookies. When loading the cookies for the second website I change the domain of the cookies from google.com to my desired website's domain. This way I can open my desired website with the right cookies. I'm having an issue where I'm getting a `chrome not reachable` error message.   By the look of it it seems when I want to preload the cookies with the `driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Network.setCookie')` method the driver doesn't want to initialise the second website. Here are my arguments for the driver:  ```     chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()     chrome_options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')     chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')     chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')     chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')     chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-tools')     chrome_options.add_argument('--remote-debugging-port=9222')     chrome_options.add_argument('--window-size=1280x1696')     chrome_options.add_argument('--user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-user-data')     chrome_options.add_argument('--single-process')     chrome_options.add_argument(""--no-zygote"")     chrome_options.add_argument('--ignore-certificate-errors')     chrome_options.binary_location = ""/opt/chrome/chrome"" ``` Here's how I initialise the first dummy website and set the custom cookies, then save it to an S3 bucket:  ```     driver.get('https://www.google.com/')     driver.add_cookie({'name':'Per_UniqueID', 'value': '12312321312u3i12u31'})     driver.add_cookie({'name':'VISITED_LANG', 'value': 'en'})     driver.add_cookie({'name':'jwtToken', 'value': 'asasd'})     save_cookies_s3() ```  Here's how I open the second website and the load_cookies function that I call before opening the website. During the load of the cookies I change the domain from my example website google.com to my desiredwebsite.com.  ```     def load_cookies_s3():         .         .. loading cookies from S3 bucket         pickle_cookies = pickle.loads(S3)          driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Network.enable', {})              for cookie in pickle_cookies:             cookie['domain'] = cookie['domain'].replace('www.google.com', 'desiredwebsite.com')                          # Set the actual cookie             driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Network.setCookie', cookie)              # Disable network tracking         driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Network.disable', {})         return 1      load_cookies_s3()     driver.get('https://desiredwebsite.com')     pretty_print(driver.get_cookies())  ```  Strange thing is that the above method of preloading the cookies before initializing the driver works on my Mac locally but not on AWS and I dont see what's going on further besides the `Chrome not reachable` error message. Sometimes (occasionally)  I'm getting the `Unknown error: unable to discover open window in chrome` error message too.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Code snippets have been shared in the main description.

"","10039","[🐛 Bug]: Safari nested iFrame 500 error","### What happened?  Hi Selenium team,  I'm having difficulty testing a piece of code that uses Selenium and SafariDriver through the NightwatchJS library. The code is working fine for Chrome and FF. I'm not 100% sure if it's a problem with nightwatch or something deeper, so am reaching out here. If this is not correct place, or somewhere better can ask, please let me know!   So far I have tried:  - [open issue on nightwatch repo](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/issues/2943)  - [open question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69959327/nightwatchjs-safari-cant-find-nested-iframe)  After debugging more am starting to think this could be an issue with either Selenium or SafariDriver. Or perhaps some misunderstanding or misconfiguration on my part.  ### Environment  ``` safaridriver - Included with Safari 14.1.1 (16611.2.7.1.4) ""selenium-server"": ""3.141.59"", ""selenium-webdriver"": ""4.0.0"", ```  ### What is the problem test?  The test needs to access an iframe within an iframe from top level document. The setup looks something like this:  ### HTML  ```html         #document                                                                                     ```  Where `#nested-frame` will need to be accessed from the top level document for inspection of content.  The test code is using [NightwatchJS](https://nightwatchjs.org/), more details about config, setup and code are in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/issues/2943).  ### Problem Summary  The problem is that to access the nested iFrame, it needs to first find `#top-frame` web element, use the returned web element and pass it to `frame` which makes the WebDriver call to change context of test session to that frame. This is all good with Chrome, FF, and Safari as they can all find this frame web element and make the switch into the frame context. My test for Safari was switching into first iFrame context. And now here is where I think there is maybe a bug or I am not understanding something:  After switching into first frame in Safari, I do an element lookup for a regular tag `` which is returned as a web element. I then try a couple different things using the web element ID:  ```html      ```  - I look for an element that I know does not exist underneath.   `  → Running command: elementIdElements ('node-3AC0121F-9C54-4BC5-B548-532E7E615BDE', 'tag name', 'span', [Function])    Request POST  /session/DD2A827C-5D8E-4C0F-A783-1991E528B25A/element/node-3AC0121F-9C54-4BC5-B548-532E7E615BDE/elements      { using: 'tag name', value: 'span' }    Response 200 POST /session/DD2A827C-5D8E-4C0F-A783-1991E528B25A/element/node-3AC0121F-9C54-4BC5-B548-532E7E615BDE/elements (37ms)    { value: [] } `  - I look for the iframe I know is there.   `  → Running command: elementIdElements ('node-700E05B9-1C42-4289-A06F-B4BF9A8A0867', 'tag name', 'iframe', [Function])    Request POST  /session/0A778850-DDC6-42EE-9F8C-60A0998962D2/element/node-700E05B9-1C42-4289-A06F-B4BF9A8A0867/elements      { using: 'tag name', value: 'iframe' }    Response 500 POST /session/0A778850-DDC6-42EE-9F8C-60A0998962D2/element/node-700E05B9-1C42-4289-A06F-B4BF9A8A0867/elements (27ms)    { value: { error: 'unknown error', message: '', stacktrace: '' } }  Error while running .locateMultipleElementsByElementId() protocol action: An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. `  It is very puzzling, my latest thinking was maybe it was a cross origin issue. But then I read on WebDriver [switch to frame](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#switch-to-frame):  `NOTE WebDriver is not bound by the same origin policy, so it is always possible to switch into child browsing contexts, even if they are different origin to the current browsing context. `  And I also tried checking `Disable Cross Origin Restrictions` from Safari Developer menu.  I'm not sure how to further debug. Maybe someone else with a fresh perspective could have a suggestion or if someone has run into a similar situation as this.

"","10830","[🐛 Bug]: Deprecated functionality removed in a minor version","### What happened?  Hi folks,  First of all, big thanks to all the active maintainers on this project. Selenium is an awesome tool and the amount of complexity you all are dealing with on a daily basis is mind-boggling. With that in mind, I hate to even be filing this issue, but I wanted to try to do my part to help out the community.  Based on my understanding of SemVer, it calls for a major version bump when backwards-incompatible changes are introduced (e.g. removing deprecated features, or possibly even the change to `move_to` behavior). Maybe I'm misunderstanding something but it seems like the 4.3 release isn't respecting that rule.  We were certainly surprised to find that those changes had been made in a minor version update, and while I imagine there may be some good reasons for the Selenium team choosing to do this it also has some potential downsides for users of the package.  Just wanted to put this out there to see if either I'm missing something here, or maybe there is some room for improvement in the way releases are handled going forward?  Thanks!  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell The changelogs for 4.3 detail the removed functionality: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases/tag/selenium-4.3.0 ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell no relevant log output ```   ### Operating System  MacOS  ### Selenium version  4.3  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

But when i try to start a secound one it said me i nedd to close my tor browser. Is there a way for selenium to do this, i realy need multiply instances with differnet ips on the same time.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell See code above ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell No ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  4.0.1  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I'm only getting started with my first intent to build a web scraper with Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup and Firefox. I've been searching the whole afternoon trying to get my head around which methods are deprecated or not and have seen many things (desiredCapabilities, profile classes, etc.) that are all deprecated. Also saw how they did it in Java or other languages but I couldn't find a solution to my specific problem.  I want to load my usual firefox (release-default) profile to be able to use the Widevine Content Decryption Module Plugin to load the amazon music page where I want to get data from.  The problem is I can't make the firefox window start with the desired add-on or profile.   Someone else has had a similiar issue but with a remote webdriver  #9949, but I'm not sure if it's the same problem because I don't do anything with remote webdrivers.  Also mentioned was the use of prefs or zipping the profile but honestly I don't know how or if that would work.    ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options  options = Options() profile_path = r'D:\Omnia\Privat\Sonstiges\jj0zhvr9.Scraper Profile'  options.set_preference('profile', profile_path) service = Service(r'./driver/geckodriver.exe')  driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options, service=service) driver.get(""https://music.amazon.com"") ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell . ```   ### Operating System  Windows 11  ### Selenium version  Python 3.8.5  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I use the Network.RequestWillBeSent event for this. Everything works well until I come across a link that opens a new tab. Such links usually have a target = ""_blank"" attribute. When a new tab opens, I do not receive requests from it. I can only get requests from the initial tab.  How can I get all the requests from the new tab? If I need to initialize a new RequestWillBeSent event for a new tab, then I will miss the first requests from the page, which are very important to me.

To allow **popup and Alert with safari** browser in iOS devices, I am trying to refactor below code with safariOptions .  Old Code   DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities(); caps.setCapability(""safariAllowPopups"", ""true""); caps.setCapability(""autoAcceptAlerts"", ""true"");  New Code   SnippetSafariOptions options = new SafariOptions();  SnippetDictionary browserstackOptions = new Dictionary();  Snippetoptions.AddAdditionalOption(""bstack:options.safari.enablePopups"", ""true"");     With new code, Safari browser doen't open new tab clicking on button while it was working fine with Old code using DesiredCapablities.  How can I allow new tab opening for iOS devices ?    I tried with safari.enablePopups (https://www.browserstack.com/automate/capabilities?tag=selenium-4), safariAllowPopups and safari.autoAcceptAlerts but no luck.    ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Open new tab clicking on button Sample website steps 1) Go to http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows 2) Click on ""Click here"" 3) Interact with opened new tab  Device : iPad Air  Selenium Version and language : 4.0.0 (.net windows) Browser name: Safari  Environment : Browserstack ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Raw Appium Logs   2022-03-02 23:20:00:927 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Executing atom 'find_element' 2022-03-02 23:20:00:928 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Executing 'find_element' atom in default context 2022-03-02 23:20:00:928 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending javascript command: '(function(){return function(){var k=this;functi...' 2022-03-02 23:20:00:928 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending '_rpc_forwardSocketData:' message to app 'PID:12308', page '1', target 'page-13' (id: 82): 'Runtime.evaluate' 2022-03-02 23:20:00:943 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Received data response from send (id: 82): '""{\""status\"":0,\""value\"":{\""ELEMENT\"":\"":wdc:1646263198811\""}}""' 2022-03-02 23:20:00:943 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending to Web Inspector took 15ms 2022-03-02 23:20:00:943 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Received result for atom 'find_element' execution: {""ELEMENT"":"":wdc:1646263198811""} 2022-03-02 23:20:00:945 - [debug] [W3C (42ab4b03)] Responding to client with driver.findElement() result: {""element-6066-11e4-a52e-4f735466cecf"":""5002"",""ELEMENT"":""5002""} 2022-03-02 23:20:00:946 - [HTTP]  GET /wd/hub/session/42ab4b03-f0c1-4fae-bd63-3fdfe2ad1b79/element/5002/enabled 2022-03-02 23:20:01:000 - [HTTP] {} 2022-03-02 23:20:01:001 - [debug] [W3C (42ab4b03)] Calling AppiumDriver.elementEnabled() with args: [""5002"",""42ab4b03-f0c1-4fae-bd63-3fdfe2ad1b79""] 2022-03-02 23:20:01:001 - [debug] [XCUITest] Executing command 'elementEnabled' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:001 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Executing atom 'is_enabled' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:001 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Executing 'is_enabled' atom in default context 2022-03-02 23:20:01:001 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending javascript command: '(function(){return function(){var g=this;functi...' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:002 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending '_rpc_forwardSocketData:' message to app 'PID:12308', page '1', target 'page-13' (id: 84): 'Runtime.evaluate' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:013 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Received data response from send (id: 84): '""{\""status\"":0,\""value\"":true}""' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:014 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending to Web Inspector took 12ms 2022-03-02 23:20:01:014 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Received result for atom 'is_enabled' execution: true 2022-03-02 23:20:01:014 - [debug] [W3C (42ab4b03)] Responding to client with driver.elementEnabled() result: true 2022-03-02 23:20:01:015 - [HTTP]  POST /wd/hub/session/42ab4b03-f0c1-4fae-bd63-3fdfe2ad1b79/execute/sync 2022-03-02 23:20:01:148 - [HTTP] {""script"":""return document.readyState"",""args"":[]} 2022-03-02 23:20:01:149 - [debug] [W3C (42ab4b03)] Calling AppiumDriver.execute() with args: [""return document.readyState"",[],""42ab4b03-f0c1-4fae-bd63-3fdfe2ad1b79""] 2022-03-02 23:20:01:149 - [debug] [XCUITest] Executing command 'execute' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:149 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Executing atom 'execute_script' 2022-03-02 23:20:01:149 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Executing 'execute_script' atom in default context 2022-03-02 23:20:01:149 - [debug] [RemoteDebugger] Sending javascript command: '(function(){return function(){var f=this;

"","9966","[🐛 Bug]: EventFiringDecorator - Application doesn't fail upon NoSuchElementException / TimeoutException","### What happened?  Hello,  We are upgrading the rougly 10 years old Selenium tests in an existing project. Since we noticed that Selenium4 was released last week we wanted to give it a try, since the version we initially started upgrading with (3.141.59) has been around for quite a while already.  With version 3.141.59 we had an _EventFiringWebDriver_ and a _Listener_ with a custom method with a _FluentWait_ that waits for JQuery etc to be finished, as well as for the element in question to be present (the application is a dinosaur and can be a tad bit slow at times, which would make tests fail every time when simply using _.findElement(By. ...)_ without the wait(s). With aforementioned version this worked great, however, with Selenium4 the EventFiringWebDriver is marked as deprecated and usage of _EventFiringDecorator_ is recommended.  So we wrote a new Listener since the API seems to have changed entirely (methods & parameters) and employed the EventFiringDecorator as instructed.  The tests seem to work at first glance, BUT: Tests don't fail anymore upon _NoSuchElementException_ or _TimoutException_ thrown by the FluentWait in the implemented listener - we can see stacktraces of elements that caused these errors to be thrown, but the application progresses until at some point an element is not clickable, which does ultimately cause the test to fail. (On a side note, tests failing at the respective points in the application is ""intentional"" since we are still in progress of upgrading - the old selenium just continued when an element wasn't found). Test code itself hasn't changed when we went from 3.141.59 to 4.0.0, only the usage of EventFiringDecorator and new implementation of the listener as mentioned above were altered.  **Stacktraces look like the following:** ``` Okt 21, 2021 10:39:03 AM org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator callListenerMethod WARNING: null java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException 	at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor5.invoke(Unknown Source) 	at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:55) 	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:508) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator.callListenerMethod(EventFiringDecorator.java:311) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator.fireBeforeEvents(EventFiringDecorator.java:231) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator.lambda$beforeCall$0(EventFiringDecorator.java:170) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator$$Lambda$305.000000001203FC80.accept(Unknown Source) 	at java.util.Arrays$ArrayList.forEach(Arrays.java:4224) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.events.EventFiringDecorator.beforeCall(EventFiringDecorator.java:170) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.decorators.DefaultDecorated.beforeCall(DefaultDecorated.java:43) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.decorators.WebDriverDecorator.lambda$createProxy$0(WebDriverDecorator.java:293) 	at org.openqa.selenium.support.decorators.WebDriverDecorator$$Lambda$304.000000001203D690.invoke(Unknown Source) 	at com.sun.proxy.$Proxy15.findElement(Unknown Source) 	...

I think the [expected_conditions.text_to_be_present_in_element_attribute](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions.py#L245) don't work the way it should.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1100288/166081670-7db741a1-5dbe-4367-bf8c-00cfef000103.png)  In the current code, the condition L245 is useless because [element_attribute_to_include ](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/support/expected_conditions.py#L436)always return a function.  So L247 will return None if the attribute doesn't exists and L248 will raise a TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable.   I think the intended behavior is :  ` if not element_attribute_to_include(locator, attribute_)(driver):     return False `    ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions import text_to_be_present_in_element_attribute  driver = webdriver.Chrome() driver.get(""https://google.com"")  tester = text_to_be_present_in_element_attribute((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ""body""), ""missingattribute"", ""oups"") tester(driver) ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""lib\site-packages\selenium\webdriver\support\expected_conditions.py"", line 248, in _predicate     return text_ in element_text TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  4.1.3  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10313","[🐛 Bug]: se:cdp being reported as the hub interface instead of the node SE_NODE_HOST flag","### What happened?  Hello,  I'm migrating from `4.0.0-beta-4` hub and `chrome v90` node to `4.1.2` hub and `chrome v97` and I'm noticing that the `se:cdp` flag is wrongly set now, which makes my tests fail.  I've this set up on **different VMs** and I'm running the hub/node in a docker container.  On the previous version, when I queried the `se:cdp` endpoint, I would get something like: ``` [0-0]     'se:cdp': 'ws://10.112.180.69:5555/session/968314a0ce3cfe50626ce64cdbd11af0/se/cdp', [0-0]     'se:cdpVersion': '93.0.4577.82', ```  Where `10.112.180.69:5555` is what I set up on the `SE_NODE_HOST/SE_NODE_PORT`.  What I get now with the latest versions: ``` [0-0]     'se:cdp': 'ws://172.17.0.2:4444/session/bc42eae3f16f9d536c9d5a432b76e2ac/se/cdp', [0-0]     'se:cdpVersion': '97.0.4692.99', ```  Where `172.17.0.2:4444` is the Hub address... I should get what I registered there from a different machine by the `SE_NODE_HOST/SE_NODE_PORT` flags.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell  I'm starting the hub like this:  Hub:  docker run -p 4442-4444:4442-4444 selenium/hub:4.1.2  Node: docker run -p 5555:5555 \             --shm-size=""2g"" \             -e SE_NODE_MAX_INSTANCES=1 \             -e SE_NODE_MAX_SESSIONS=1 \             -e SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST=IP_FROM_HUB \             -e SE_NODE_HOST=IP_FROM_MACHINE_2 \             -e SE_NODE_PORT=5555 \             -e SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT=4442 \             -e SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT=4443 \             selenium/node-chrome:97.0 ``` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Hub Log:  2022-02-01 13:06:40,765 INFO Included extra file ""/etc/supervisor/conf.d/selenium-grid-hub.conf"" during parsing 2022-02-01 13:06:40,767 INFO supervisord started with pid 8 2022-02-01 13:06:41,770 INFO spawned: 'selenium-grid-hub' with pid 10 13:06:42.167 INFO [LoggingOptions.configureLogEncoding] - Using the system default encoding 2022-02-01 13:06:42,170 INFO success: selenium-grid-hub entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 0 seconds (startsecs) 13:06:42.172 INFO [OpenTelemetryTracer.createTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing 13:06:42.270 INFO [BoundZmqEventBus.] - XPUB binding to [binding to tcp://*:4442, advertising as tcp://172.17.0.2:4442], XSUB binding to [binding to tcp://*:4443, advertising as tcp://172.17.0.2:4443] 13:06:42.334 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Connecting to tcp://172.17.0.2:4442 and tcp://172.17.0.2:4443 13:06:42.353 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Sockets created 13:06:43.355 INFO [UnboundZmqEventBus.] - Event bus ready 13:06:44.042 INFO [Hub.execute] - Started Selenium Hub 4.1.2 (revision 9a5a329c5a): http://172.17.0.2:4444 13:06:59.399 INFO [Node.] - Binding additional locator mechanisms: name, id, relative 13:06:59.783 INFO [LocalDistributor.add] - Added node 69e680eb-7236-4de5-874a-f9da9af957d2 at http://10.112.180.69:5555.

"","10794","[🐛 Bug]: IEDriverServer stuck when remote node windows session locked","### What happened?  Hello,  As we are upgrading grid 2 to grid 4 I am facing the following issue: running a basic test on a remote (node) windows machine hangs IE  on the initial page with the following error : ""This is the initial start page for the WebDriver server"" in case that remote session is disconnected. It is not the case for chrome, firefox or edge that run without any issue. IE also works fine if I stay connected on the remote desktop session of that node. Versions and configurations: - Selenium jar version 4.2.1 or 4.2.2 - IEDriverServer.exe version 4.2.0.0 (tested also with older versions) 32bit version - Node OS: windows server 2019 or 2016 - IE zoom 100% and same protected mode on all zones (in fact the same nodes are working fine with selenium 2.53) - I also tested without success the following options: ignoreZoomSettings, introduceFlakinessByIgnoringSecurityDomains and disableNativeEvents - I also tested as administrator (just in case) - The log in eclipse console report System info: host: 'SELEN1', ip: '1.2.3.4', os.name: 'Windows Server 2012 R2', os.arch: 'x86' but in fact it is a 2019 server x64   The issue is also present when I try to run Edge in IE mode. I guess it is related to IEDriverServer.  I saw that this issue is reported in 2020 on google groups but nobody answered it. The link is here https://groups.google.com/g/selenium-users/c/G_6nrNrTc5Y/m/vGm8WZkzAAAJ  Thank you in advance, Marius  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell 1. open a remote (rdc) session and run this command in cmd (as regular user or administrator) to start the node on windows 2016 or 2019: c:\> java -jar selenium-server-4.2.1.jar standalone Disconnect your remote session (X)  run the following code from a remote machine : 	InternetExplorerOptions options = new InternetExplorerOptions(); 	WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(""http://1.2.3.4:4444), options); 	driver.get(""https://www.google.com""); 	driver.quit();  After few moments connect again your remote session. You will see IE hanged with the following message ""This is the initial start page for the WebDriver server""  If you repeat the test by keeping the remote session connected you will be able to see your test completed. ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Exception in thread ""main"" org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Could not start a new session.

"","10336","[🐛 Bug]: Chrome's Webdriver getting stuck on `driver.get(URL)` since v91+","### What happened?  Hello,  As a pet project, I'm working on a web-extension, which is tested using selenium's python binding. After a while without activity, I got back to it recently, discovering that my automated tests were no longer able to pass reliably for chrome. Coming here, my issue looked very much like https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10002 (where I [commented](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10002#issuecomment-1030918722)), but seems to be slightly different.  To detail the issue, at a very high reproduction rate (but not 100%, so some tests still pass), selenium gets completely stuck on a `driver.get(URL)` call, halting the progress of all tests. Obviously the CI thus times-out after a while without any output. I identified this situation by running our pytest tests with the `--pdb` option, then interrupting with a Ctrl+C keypress to obtain the stack trace (cf my comment in #10002 ).  As it does not seem easy to reproduce with a simple python script, so I suspect that either the fact that we're loading a web-extension, or that the sites we rely on for testing are slow might play an important part in this issue.  Also, attempting to set the following did not help:  - option: --disable-browser-side-navigation  - `driver.set_page_load_timeout(30)` failed to trigger the TimeoutException  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  For now, I don't have much more than our own repository and its Circle CI tests:  https://github.com/BookMyComics-Developers/BookMyComics    ### Relevant log output  ```shell tests/func/test_register.py::TestRegister::test_escape_key_handling[chrome] ^CFAILED >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> traceback >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  controller =  unique_reader =       @staticmethod     def test_escape_key_handling(controller, unique_reader):         """"""             Validates that pressing the ""ESCAPE"" key on the ""adder menu""             discards it.

For the last few days me and other people have been trying to use CDP commands via Selenium, however nothing seems to function as expected. Selenium always returns ""se:cdp"": ""ws://"" instead of HTTP - that's problem 1, and problem 2 is that even trying to communicate via ws:// Selenium never returns anything, it just gets stuck.  If you do send ""bad"" or ""missing"" parameters Selenium will return an error message, but if you do send a ""correct"" command, nothing will happen.  I would like to focus only on problem 2 which is the ws:// cdp usage, since I spent several days to try and use HTTP without success.

Following is the TOML configuration file I used to setup node component for Selenium classic grid. The publish-events and subscribe-events was ignore and it connected to event bus on localhost (0.0.0.0). As a result it kept attempting ""Sending registration event"" and did not add the node.   It only worked when used flags CLI options **--publish-events** and **--subscribe-events** in the command line. As per your documentation - ""All the options shown in [CLI options] can be configured through a [TOML] file."" Please update your documentation or fix the issue so it can work with TOML configuration.  **Config TOML:** ` [server] port=5556 host= ""node.hostname.org"" bind-host = true  [node] detect-drivers = true grid-url = ""http://hub.hostname"" session-timeout = 900  [events] bind-bus = false publish-events = ""tcp://hub-ip:4442"" subscribe-events = ""tcp://hub-ip:4443"" `  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell You can reproduce this issue by setting up classic grid on windows servers.

Same code works fine with Chrome. Differences in driver implementation i e addon installation are not relevant in the test i e I do not use any specific setting, user profile or something else.  Latest Geckodriver and Firefox. Geckodriver process as well as a Firefox (with this robot icon in the address bar proving it being started remotely) are started, so the path issue reported often is not an issue (while path is set anyway). I did a complete reinstall of Firefox *without* taking over old settings, so old firefox settings cannot be the root cause.  I discovered the issue when recently doing the upgrade to Selenium 4.x and testing some of my standard modules. However, I do not use FireFox very often so I cannot completely rule out it would have happened with 3.141 since a specific firefox version.

"","10145","[🐛 Bug]: selenium python module is not PEP517 compliant","### What happened?  Disclaimer: This issue ticket is not strict bug report but more question or discussion (I'm trying to understand background of some technical decisions)  PEP517 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) is widely accepted as build framework. Looks like selenium is trying to use bazel which seem is used only to generate or download few .js files. If those files would be part of the source tree existing py/setup.{py,cfg} files could be used to generate .whl , sdist archives or build and install selenium  using `setuptools`.  Is it any particular reason why in case of `selenium ` is used bazel? (which seems has quite complicated build dependencies) And/or: why not just extend somehow py/setup.py to add generate/download missing .js files?  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell N/A ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell N/A ```   ### Operating System  N/A  ### Selenium version  4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

However, filtering the  tag containing the specific value, returns the error.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell ` # subscribe for the list elements to be open extract_product_links.subscribe_page_load(web_driver=web_driver, css_selector=selection_list_container_expanded_css) selection_list_container = web_driver.find_element(by=By.CSS_SELECTOR, value=selection_list_container_expanded_css)  print(""Possibilities:"", [a.text for a in selection_list_container.find_elements(by=By.XPATH, value="".//li"")]) print(""Size option:"", size_option) print(""XPATH Selector:"", f'.//li[text()=""{size_option}""]')  # select the case where the size option label equals the size_option size_selector = selection_list_container.find_element(by=By.XPATH, value=f'.//li[text()=""{size_option}""]') ` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell Possibilities: ['xs', 's', 'm', 'l', 'xl', 'xxl'] Size option: xs XPath Selector: .//li[text()=""xs""]   And the error: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element: {""method"":""xpath"",""selector"":"".//li[text()=""xs""]""}   (Session info: chrome=99.0.4844.83) Stacktrace: 0   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c42159 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 5120345 1   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104bcfb13 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 4651795 2   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047bfe68 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 392808 3   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047f5181 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 610689 4   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047f5341 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 611137 5   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047e9a77 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 563831 6   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104812b6d ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 732013 7   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047e99b5 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 563637 8   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104812c4e ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 732238 9   ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104825637 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 808503 10  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104812a33 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 731699 11  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047e85dd ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 558557 12  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x00000001047e94f5 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 562421 13  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104bff38d ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 4846477 14  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c1921c ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 4952604 15  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c1ea12 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 4975122 16  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c19b4a ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 4954954 17  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104bf45b0 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 4801968 18  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c33f78 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 5062520 19  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c340ff ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 5062911 20  ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver       0x0000000104c49545 ef7a2bf9fe65c296_chromedriver + 5150021 21  libsystem_pthread.dylib             0x00007ff8135124f4 _pthread_start + 125 22  libsystem_pthread.dylib             0x00007ff81350e00f thread_start + 15 ```   ### Operating System  MacOS Monterey 12.2  ### Selenium version  4.1.13  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

I am unable to select Choice2 by text due to the ""dive tag beiing in the way"".

"","10532","[🐛 Bug]: ""invalid cookie domain"" thrown when on 500 server error page","### What happened?  Calling `webDriver.manage().addCookie(new Cookie(""XDEBUG_SESSION"", ""IDEA""))` when the browser is showing a 500 error screen causes 'invalid cookie domain' exception. This exception is very confusing because the current URL reports the correct domain and the cookie has no domain specified.  Fixing the 500 error and re-running causes the cookie set to succeed.  Many servers will respond with a content body for a 500 error; but some may not. When no body is returned, the browser renders a generic 500 error screen. I suspect it is this generic error screen that is leading to the invalid cookie domain exception, however a missing content body for a response should not impact the cookie or at least cause a more reasonable exception message like ""Cannot set cookie on browser-generated generic error screen for 500 response code""  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell Using docker image `seleniarm/standalone-chromium:4.1.2-20220227` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell org.openqa.selenium.InvalidCookieDomainException: invalid cookie domain           (Session info: chrome=98.0.4758.102)         Build info: version: '4.1.2', revision: '9a5a329c5a'         System info: host: '8047a03e41c1', ip: '172.18.0.6', os.name: 'Linux', os.arch: 'amd64', os.version: '5.4.0-77-generic', java.version: '11.0.14.1'         Driver info: org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver         Command: [193fd5e6405aec2cc413ddc777afe5c5, addCookie {cookie=XDEBUG_SESSION=IDEA; path=/}]         Capabilities {acceptInsecureCerts: true, browserName: chrome, browserVersion: 98.0.4758.102, chrome: {chromedriverVersion: 98.0.4758.102 (273bf7ac8c90..., userDataDir: /tmp/.org.chromium.Chromium...}, goog:chromeOptions: {debuggerAddress: localhost:45225}, javascriptEnabled: true, networkConnectionEnabled: false, pageLoadStrategy: normal, platform: LINUX, platformName: LINUX, proxy: Proxy(), se:cdp: ws://172.27.0.12:4444/sessi..., se:cdpVersion: 98.0.4758.102, se:vnc: ws://172.27.0.12:4444/sessi..., se:vncEnabled: true, se:vncLocalAddress: ws://172.27.0.12:7900, setWindowRect: true, strictFileInteractability: false, timeouts: {implicit: 0, pageLoad: 300000, script: 30000}, unhandledPromptBehavior: dismiss and notify, webauthn:extension:credBlob: true, webauthn:extension:largeBlob: true, webauthn:virtualAuthenticators: true}         Session ID: 193fd5e6405aec2cc413ddc777afe5c5           at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)           at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:62)           at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)           at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:490)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.codec.w3c.W3CHttpResponseCodec.createException(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:200)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.codec.w3c.W3CHttpResponseCodec.decode(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:133)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.codec.w3c.W3CHttpResponseCodec.decode(W3CHttpResponseCodec.java:53)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.HttpCommandExecutor.execute(HttpCommandExecutor.java:184)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.TracedCommandExecutor.execute(TracedCommandExecutor.java:51)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver.execute(RemoteWebDriver.java:558)           at org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver$RemoteWebDriverOptions.addCookie(RemoteWebDriver.java:763) ```   ### Operating System  Linux  ### Selenium version  Java 4.1.2  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

Steps like correctly setting up VCTools and MSBuild environment variables are unclear and there are either missing requirements or unclear specifications for portions of the Bazel build instructions. From what I understood after looking around for support on this topic it looks like this has been a long standing issue, as mention by @jimevans, due to a combination of factors:  > If you try building using `bazel build //dotnet/…`, you’re going to have a Bad Time™. The rule set used to build the .NET bindings is not the “official” Bazel .NET rules, because those rules make some assumptions that run counter to how .NET environments like to build. This is particularly so with multiple framework versions encompassing .NET Framewotk, .NET Core, and the subsequent unification of those with .NET 5 and beyond..  >  > The ones we _do_ use, are much better in that regard, but they’re also wildly incomplete, mostly in the execution of stuff using `bazel test` or `bazel run`. We attempt to use some custom rules in those cases, but they’re, frankly speaking, poorly written. >  > The custom rules’ author (me) doesn’t know what he’s doing when constructing Bazel rules, and no one with any real expertise in writing Bazel rules seems to have any interest in donating effort to make them actually work. Those same people with the proper Bazel skill set also usually have no understanding of the peculiarities of .NET projects, or the know how to make them to work seamlessly on Windows.  - _Originally posted by @jimevans in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9915#issuecomment-944896131_ ---  I recently went through all of the steps in the documentation for a fresh setup, using the linked blog article for WIndows as a reference as well, and after spending a few hours trying to resolve it I was still ultimately unsuccessful in building even the dotnet project via VS command line.  **Note:**  Building just the WebDriver, WebDriver.Support, and WebDriverBackedSelenium dotnet projects from within Visual Studio 2019 works and successfully builds the DLLs for each .NET standard and framework. Building the tests is a different story...  We should potentially consider moving away from the Bazel implementation for complete building via command line.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  - On latest Windows 10 with latest Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio Command Line Tools installed, follow all of the documented steps for setting up the Bazel build environment - You may need to use the linked blog article for assistance with some of the steps - Run command to build dotnet using Bazel: `bazel build //dotnet/`   ### Operating System  Windows 10 v19044.1586  ### Selenium version  Fresh checkout of Selenium 4 trunk","open","C-build,","cgv-wd","2022-03-22T14:43:09Z","2022-03-22T22:52:18Z"

As part of [OpenWPM](https://github.com/openwpm/OpenWPM) we use Selenium to drive multiple Firefox browsers in parallel.  To capture, enrich and redirect the browser's logging output, we use named pipes that look like normal log files to Selenium. However pipes don't support seeking so the need to be opened with `w` and not with `a+` as the [`firefox.Service` currently does](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/268161f84fb63e3e3e3177eb8b99b812ee3ae413/py/selenium/webdriver/firefox/service.py#L49).

[A newer approach that tries to call `firefox.Service.__init__` and open the `log_file` afterwards](https://github.com/openwpm/OpenWPM/blob/45ffd5a752e88c24607776e62cd2d53c965effb4/openwpm/deploy_browsers/selenium_firefox.py#L80-L105) doesn't work at all, so I wanted to check if there was an appetite to address this issue upstream.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell import os from selenium.webdriver import Firefox from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service pipe_name = ""selenium_pipe.log"" os.mkfifo(pipe_name, 0o600) service=Service(executable_path=""firefox"",log_path=pipe_name) driver = Firefox(     service=service ) driver.get(""https://example.com"") ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell File ""/home/vringar/selenium_mvp/demo.py"", line 9, in      service=Service(executable_path=""firefox"",log_path=pipe_name) File ""/home/stefan/.conda/envs/openwpm/lib/python3.10/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/firefox/service.py"", line 50, in __init__     log_file = open(log_path, ""a+"") if log_path else None io.UnsupportedOperation: File or stream is not seekable. ```   ### Operating System  Linux  ### Selenium version  Python 4.1.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10823","[🐛 Bug]: devtools.debugger.resume() can effectively not be used","### What happened?  Applying one of the fixes suggested for issue #10804 , it is now possible to enable the debugger using the provided Selenium wrapper (`debugger.enable()`). However, it seems like the wrapper `debugger.resume()` can effectively not be used, preventing one from resuming JavaScript execution after a breakpoint was triggered.  As the code below demonstrates, the command `session.execute(devtools.debugger.resume())` is not executed. From what I understand, Selenium ""freezes"" at the `button.click()` statement (which triggers the breakpoint), as the missing `""This statement after the click is not executed.""` message illustrates.  As I launched the click method using `nursery.start_soon`, I allowed the execution to actually reach `session.execute(devtools.debugger.resume())`, however, it still does not execute. It seems like the click statement blocks Selenium internally when it tries to send the CDP resume command to Chrome.  As a test website for the code, you can use this small HTML file and host it using `python3 -m http.server`: ```              Click me!   ```  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell import trio import time from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager   async def perform_click(driver):     # Locate button and click it     button = driver.find_element(By.ID, ""button"")     button.click()     print(""This statement after the click is not executed."")   async def main():     driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))      async with driver.bidi_connection() as connection:         session, devtools = connection.session, connection.devtools          driver.get('http://localhost:8000/test.html')          # For debugger.enable to work, the fix suggested for issue #10804 has to be applied         await session.execute(devtools.debugger.enable())         await session.execute(devtools.dom_debugger.set_event_listener_breakpoint(""click""))          async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:             nursery.start_soon(perform_click, driver)             time.sleep(2)             print(""This statement is executed..."")             await session.execute(devtools.debugger.resume())   # ... but this one is not.  trio.run(main) ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell [WDM] - ====== WebDriver manager ====== [WDM] - Current google-chrome version is 103.0.5060 [WDM] - Get LATEST chromedriver version for 103.0.5060 google-chrome [WDM] - Driver [/home/tim/.wdm/drivers/chromedriver/linux64/103.0.5060.53/chromedriver] found in cache This statement is executed... ```   ### Operating System  Linux Mint 20.1  ### Selenium version  Python 4.3.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

With that I finally was able to track it back to https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/remote/bridge.rb:  ``` def element_location_once_scrolled_into_view(element)    send_keys_to_element(element, [''])    element_location(element) end ```  After commenting it out, it got back to work.  ``` def element_location_once_scrolled_into_view(element)    #send_keys_to_element(element, [''])    element_location(element) end ```  I could not find any reason (e.g. in https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-scrolls-into-view) why this line with #send_keys should be in here.  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell require 'selenium-webdriver' $driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome $driver.get ""https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&hl=en-GB"" ($driver.find_element(:xpath,""//span[contains(text(),'‪English (United Kingdom)‬')]"")).location_once_scrolled_into_view ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell ""[ERROR]Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ElementNotInteractableError: element not interactable\n  (Session info: chrome=99.0.4844.84)"" ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  selenium-webdriver-4.1.0, ruby 3.1.1p18  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10019","[🐛 Bug]: driver.execute_script() does not work with chromedriver/msedgedriver v96 - return dict and not WebDriver object","### What happened?  After updating chrome and/or msedge to v96, driver.execute_script() no longer works it returns a dict(hash) instead of webDriver element:  I need to execute a shadowRoot pseudo-element in order to get the properties inside the element.  I think there are changes in the browser driver that prevent this from working, I think this can be reproduceable with any pseudo-elements that needs javascript executing.  I've tried all combinations of: ``` options.w3c = True|False options.add_experimental_option('w3c', True|False) ```  Current workaround is not updating beyond v95 of chrome/msedge      ### How can we reproduce the issue?

The mouse pointer moves to the source element and clicks on draggable element as i notice the cursor type change to rectangle block to confirm click and hold.  But action of moving to the target element with draggable element does happen.  If i manually move the mouse the cursor type changes back to pointer and i see the pointer move to target element without the draggable element. ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell noen ```   ### Operating System  Windows Server 2019  ### Selenium version  Java 8  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

For example, on a webpage, we have HTML like this: ```   Test  text    Here is  some   text   I      wrote     ``` We have more than one whitespace in the text. In most browsers, like Chrome and Safari, the redundant whitespaces will be removed when the HTML gets rendered. However, if we use the selenium webdriver `getText()` command to get the text value, I will get inconsistent results.  In chromedriver, I get no redundant whitespaces: ``` Test text Here is some text I wrote ``` In safari driver, I get the original text with all whitespaces: ```  Test  text    Here is  some   text   I      wrote   ```   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell I have setup a test content: https://jsfiddle.net/tyao/o0v8jywm/1/  Run below code:  const {Builder, Browser, By, Key, until} = require('selenium-webdriver'); const chrome = require('selenium-webdriver/chrome'); const safari = require('selenium-webdriver/safari');  (async function example() {     const serviceS = new safari.ServiceBuilder('/usr/bin/safaridriver');     let driverS = await new Builder().forBrowser(Browser.SAFARI).build();     console.log('Safari ===========================================================');     await getResult(driverS);      const serviceC = new chrome.ServiceBuilder(require('chromedriver').path);     let driverC = await new Builder().forBrowser(Browser.CHROME).build();     console.log('Chrome ===========================================================');     await getResult(driverC); })();  async function getResult(driver) {     try {         await driver.get('https://jsfiddle.net/tyao/o0v8jywm/1/');         await driver.switchTo().frame('result')         let text1 = await driver.findElement(By.css('#test-double-whitespaces')).getText();         let text2 = await driver.findElement(By.css('#test-whitespaces')).getText();         console.log(text1)         console.log(text2)       } finally {         await driver.quit();       } } ```  You should see output: ``` Safari ===========================================================   Test  text    Here is  some   text   I      wrote     Chrome =========================================================== Test text Here is some text I wrote ``` ``` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell No error log ```   ### Operating System  macOs Monterey  ### Selenium version  JavaScript v4.2.0  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

As commit message mentioned, Selenium Deprecated Opera Support by non-W3C support [[java] Add deprecated warnings to OperaDriver and OperaOptions](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/commit/b3f9d377d04dcefb5bfbc6fbdaffccf946bfedda)  But as below code, Opera support W3C by additional option, so do we still need remove Opera in Selenium? JWP --> ``` @Test   public void operaOptionsTest() {      operaOptions = new OperaOptions(); //    operaOptions.setExperimentalOption(""w3c"",true);     driver = new OperaDriver(operaOptions);     driver.get(""https://www.bing.com/"");    } //in log --> 7月 02, 2022 12:01:49 上午 org.openqa.selenium.remote.ProtocolHandshake createSession 信息: Detected upstream dialect: OSS ``` W3C  ``` @Test public void operaOptionsTest() {   operaOptions = new OperaOptions();   operaOptions.setExperimentalOption(""w3c"",true);   driver = new OperaDriver(operaOptions);   driver.get(""https://www.bing.com/""); } // in log --> 7月 02, 2022 12:05:22 上午 org.openqa.selenium.remote.ProtocolHandshake createSession 信息: Detected upstream dialect: W3C ``` reference:  https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/issues/96#issuecomment-985291083 https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/issues/100#issuecomment-1134277851  2. ChromeDriver doesn't not work well with Opera As doc mentioned, it expect to work under ChromeOptions https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/open_browser/#opera  But throw exception on my side ``` @Test public void operaWithChromeOptionsTest() {   // ChromeDriver is 102.0.5005.61   // Opera is 88 based on Chrome/102.0.5005.115   chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();   chromeOptions.setBinary(""/${OPERA_HOME}/opera.exe"");   driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions);   driver.get(""https://www.ianzhang.cn/""); } // org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Could not start a new session.

"","10831","[🐛 Bug]: Zombie ChromeDriver with data:, involving session request queue (Python PoC)","### What happened?  **DESCRIPTION**  There is a (reproducible) situation where a zombie ChromeDriver page with `data:,` is created.  This happens when a driver quits (due to session-request-timeout) and yet a Chrome session is created for that script, which has just quit. Since the script is no more, the Chrome session is left orphan with a `data:,`.  This can be reproduced easily by playing with a timer in a script.  **SETUP**  Using a hub and a single node with one single available chrome session:  Command to start the hub:  `java -jar selenium-server-4.3.0.jar hub --config hub.toml`  Content of hub.toml:  ``` [server] host = ""localhost"" port = 4444 [sessionqueue] session-request-timeout = 10 ```  Command to start the node:  `java -jar selenium-server-4.3.0.jar node --config node.toml`  Content of node.toml:  ``` [node] detect-drivers = true driver-implementation = [""chrome""] max-sessions = 1 grid-url = ""http://localhost:4444"" session-timeout = 5 ```  **HOW TO REPRODUCE**  The simplest way I've found to reproduce this issue is by executing 2 scripts simultaneously:  The first one (occupy.py) blocks the unique session for arround 'session-request-timeout' seconds. The second one (dummy.py), waits in the session request queue for 'session-request-timeout' seconds, and quits the driver without getting a session (apparently, since it actually ""gets"" one).  The second one will be given a session (although the script has already quitted the driver), and a zombie `data:,` chrome is left open.  _Check the Code section for both scripts._  Running those simultaneously (occupy.py and dummy.py) with  ``` start python ""occupy.py"" start python ""dummy.py"" ```  (in that order) will:  1. (occupy.py) Open _about:blank_ 2. (occupy.py) quit and close Chrome window 3. (dummy.py) quit driver 3. A zombie `data:,` chrome is left open  The _about:blank_ for the second script (dummy.py) is never opened, since the script has quitted, but the session persists.  This has to do with timings (see `time.wait(7.5)` at occupy.py), which might need to be adjusted by adding or substracting at most one unit (seconds). Tested in several versions (check below).   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell [occupy.py]  from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Remote(command_executor = ""http://localhost:4444"", desired_capabilities = {""browserName"": ""chrome""}) driver.get(""about:blank"") import time time.sleep(7.5) # session-request-timeout = 10 (substract aprox 2.5 sec, may vary +- 1 sec.) driver.quit()   [dummy.py]  from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Remote(command_executor = ""http://localhost:4444"", desired_capabilities = {""browserName"": ""chrome""}) driver.get(""about:blank"") driver.quit() ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell . ```   ### Operating System  Windows 10  ### Selenium version  Java 4.3.0, Java 4.1.3  ### What are the browser(s) and version(s) where you see this issue?

"","10552","[🐛 Bug]: RemoteWebDriver - Unexpected error creating WebSocket DevTools session.","### What happened?  ### Issue This issue happens when attempting to retrieve a Dev Tools session using a `RemoteWebDriver` instance connecting to Selenium hosted on a remote server. In this case, I hosted the grid as **Hub & Node** style where all are hosted in a Kubernetes Cluster.  When retrieving the Dev Tools session, the error logged seems to indicate that the Node **IP Address** and **Port Number** that is being connected to is not responding (either invalid/blocked). Based on the example log output provided, `10.32.129.130:4444` is the Selenium Node **IP Address** and **Port Number** that it is trying to connect to.  ### Expected The **IP Address** is correct, but the **Port Number** used is wrong as the Selenium Node being hosted uses a default port number of 5555, which may explain the failure to connect when retrieving the Dev Tools session.  Is it possible to change the port number used to connect and create Dev Tools session (assuming the wrong port number is the one causing the issue)?  ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell // Create options var options = new OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome.ChromeOptions(); options.AddArguments(""--no-sandbox"", ""--disable-dev-shm-usage"", ""--disable-gpu"", ""--disable-cache"", ""--disable-infobars"", ""--window-size=1366,768"", ""--start-maximized"", ""--disable-extensions"", ""--remote-debugging-port=9230"", ""--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"", ""user-agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.93 Safari/537.36"");  // Create Driver var driver = new OpenQA.Selenium.Remote.RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(""http://:4444/wd/hub""), options.ToCapabilities(), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));  // Start DevTools session (Error here) var devToolsSession = driver.GetDevToolsSession(); ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell OpenQA.Selenium.WebDriverException: Unexpected error creating WebSocket DevTools session.  ---> System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocketException (0x80004005): Unable to connect to the remote server  ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.

I did tried upgrade to the selenium-java 4.1.2 from 3.141.59 by Maven. However, the dependent library version was not updated.  I suspect a library conflict, so I did some tests. But I can't find the conflict in case.  I created a new empty project and tested it, it included the spring-boot-starter-parent and the problem occurred. I have no expert knowledge of Maven.  Explicitly adding dependent library versions solved the problem. But I'd like to keep the pom.xml as simple as possible.  Is there any workaround for this? can you help me.   ### How can we reproduce the issue?  ```shell pom.xml        4.0.0            com.example     demo2     1.0-SNAPSHOT      Selenium Test               1.8         1.8            		 			org.seleniumhq.selenium 			selenium-java 			4.1.2 		       ``` ```   ### Relevant log output  ```shell # With spring-boot-starter-parent $ mvn dependency:tree [INFO] --- maven-dependency-plugin:3.2.0:tree (default-cli) @ demo2 --- [INFO] com.example:demo2:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT [INFO] \- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-api:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-chrome-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    |  +- net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy:jar:1.11.22:compile [INFO]    |  +- org.apache.commons:commons-exec:jar:1.3:compile [INFO]    |  +- com.google.guava:guava:jar:25.0-jre:compile [INFO]    |  |  +- com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar:1.3.9:compile [INFO]    |  |  +- org.checkerframework:checker-compat-qual:jar:2.0.0:compile [INFO]    |  |  +- com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations:jar:2.1.3:compile [INFO]    |  |  +- com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:jar:1.1:compile [INFO]    |  |  \- org.codehaus.mojo:animal-sniffer-annotations:jar:1.14:compile [INFO]    |  +- com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:jar:3.14.9:compile [INFO]    |  \- com.squareup.okio:okio:jar:1.14.0:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-devtools-v85:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    |  +- com.google.auto.service:auto-service-annotations:jar:1.0.1:compile [INFO]    |  +- com.google.auto.service:auto-service:jar:1.0.1:compile [INFO]    |  |  \- com.google.auto:auto-common:jar:1.2:compile [INFO]    |  \- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-json:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-devtools-v95:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-devtools-v96:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-devtools-v97:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-edge-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-firefox-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-firefox-xpi-driver:jar:4.1.2:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-ie-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-opera-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-remote-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-safari-driver:jar:3.141.59:compile [INFO]    \- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-support:jar:3.141.59:compile  # Without spring-boot-starter-parent $ mvn dependency:tree ...

Client sends Options with only w3c syntax (Se 4 Ruby/.NET/JS) — No warnings 2. Client sends Options with a valid handshake with both W3C & OSS and driver supports w3c (Se 3; Se 4 Java) — No warnings 3. Client sends Options a valid handshake with both W3C & OSS, but driver only supports or is set to use OSS — Warning that OSS mode deprecated 4. Client sends only OSS Capabilities (Se 2 or DesiredCapabilities class) — Warning to use W3C Capabilities  One issue is for use case 2, if the user is working with Selenium 3.0 - 3.8.1 (handshake, but not fully w3c compliant), Selenium reports w3c mode, but will attempt to convert any commands that aren't w3c compliant. So these people might likely wouldn't get warnings, but would have code stop working after we remove deprecations. The bright side is that only 6% of downloads are in this range for Java, and the likelihood that these people have not updated their client version, but *have updated their Grid version is likely an extremely small cross-section","closed","C-java,","titusfortner","2022-03-02T20:06:59Z","2022-05-25T21:14:02Z"

We should consider creating an API or options for things like ""pinch,"" ""zoom,"" and ""scroll"".  Whatever this API is, it should match what an Appium user does or would expect to do in native application contexts.   ### Usage example  ```java new Actions(driver)         .zoom(locus, startRadius, endRadius, pinchAngle, duration)         .perform(); ```","open","I-enhancement,","titusfortner","2022-06-24T15:09:45Z","2022-06-29T14:30:20Z"

The messages do not include the ""Process Identifier"" allocated by Windows 10,  nor does it display the date/time when the Driver instance was started.  I run many instances of Selenium Chrome Driver concurrently. They may , or may not be spawned by the same parent process. For various reasons the parent process may no longer able to shut down a specific instance. So Windows 10 Process Monitor must be used to manually remove the Driver instance. However identifying the orphaned instance is guess work.  If the Driver log displayed PID and Start/Time this ambiguity could be eliminated. It would also be useful if the parent process had identified itself at Browser Start. This could be easily done by allowing a start up preference like this . . .      Driver.setPreference ""browser.startup.invokedby"", ""ShippingScheduleDownloader.exe""  Killing the wrong Driver instance can be extremely inconvenient ![Selenium Chrome Driver ~ Log file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105487255/168253721-62cad11a-bcd8-494a-b1a9-7e62e01617d3.png) .  ### Usage example  Use Case : A Process, that initiated Selenium Chrome Driver, crashes. The Selenium Chrome Driver continues to run. Its Chrome Browser has its Profile Directory locked. By killing the Selenium Chrome Driver all resources and points of potential contention are released. I should be able to look at each of the Selenium Chrome Driver log windows and see which one was started at the requisite time, and invocation context (""invokedby""). The Selenium Chrome Driver log window will also show the Process Identifier of Selenium Chrome Driver. Using the Process Identifier I would then  use Windows 10 Process Monitor to kill the orphaned process only.","closed","G-chromedriver,","BugFinderBugFixer","2022-05-13T09:44:29Z","2022-06-13T00:13:40Z"
"","10884","[🚀 Feature]: Get download percentage","### Feature and motivation  When downloading files from a website sometimes we need to check if the download have ended and the file is ready. A native way to check this would be very useful. As you can see in this link with more than 80k views its relatively popular request. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34338897/python-selenium-find-out-when-a-download-has-completed  There are some work around but they are not perfect. Checking the download folders manually can cause problems when there are other programs that are also downloading in the same folder.  Checking .crdownload files can be a problem when you are downloading multiple files. Checking a file name can be a problem because sometimes filenames are send random from the server.  The code below is a good attempt and works ok for big files but I had problems with small ones and sometimes fails for some reason. ``` downloadPercentage = driver.execute_script(                 ""return document.querySelector('downloads-manager').shadowRoot.querySelector('#downloadsList downloads-item').shadowRoot.querySelector('#progress').value"") ```  A native way to check if download finished or not, what is the percentage, did the download finished successfully or failed, would be very usefull.  ### Usage example  I want to use this feature when downloading many files from a website that requires login and only allow some number of concurrent downloads at the same time.

These areas can likely be simplified by exposing some sort of `LocatesElementsMixin` (or whatever is better named in line with other bindings; a mixin class is just an idea as it has some drawbacks too, but this issue is more just to figure out what would be a good approach to unifying it.  A few of the problems:   - Keeping backwards compatibility  - The actual webdriver `Command` dispatch varies throughout  - instance attributes vary in naming which makes a mixin class a little tougher and unclean  Curious on your thoughts to this?  @AutomatedTester has a comment in `ShadowRoot.py` here; I assume it was also aiming to move towards something _like_ this?  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/575b878db2efccdde95ea8d0bdf6b8db4bea1fa0/py/selenium/webdriver/remote/shadowroot.py#L26  Python is not java of course so we should keep that in mind and leverage duck typing etc where applicable.","open","I-enhancement,","symonk","2022-05-15T17:49:36Z","2022-06-08T19:42:10Z"

"","10129","[🚀 Feature]: Python Difficulties with ShadowRoot object interface","### Feature and motivation  The ShadowRoot object interface differs from the WebElement object interface in terms of keyword arguments on some similar functions:  Currently the ShadowRoot object find_element and find_elements functions have the signature:  `def find_element(self, using, value):`  `def find_elements(self, using, value):`  however the webelement objects have:  `def find_element(self, by=By.ID, value=None):`  `def find_elements(self, by=By.ID, value=None):`  The issue with this is that it prevents using the shadow root elements and the web elements when duck typing as if you try and use something like:  `element.find_element(by=By.NAME, value='test-element')`  this won't work when the element happens to be a shadow root as the keyword arguments don't line up (forcing you to not use keyword arguments).   Another issue i've run into when migrating to selenium 4 is that the ShadowRoot class is hidden from the interface, which i think is because in the Java and .net versions of the package the aim is to use the SearchContext, however this isn't available in the python package and so it feels a bit difficult to use as a result e.g.  - theres no option to overwrite the internal functions with adjusted ones.   - The exception NoSuchShadowRootException doesn't seem to be public on the exceptions module - When you get a detached shadow root it seems to get wrapped into a NoSuchElementException whereas it would be nice if we could react to the shadow root becoming detached (similarly to a stale element exception) rather than it looking like the element doesn't exist.  ### Usage example  Aligning the interfaces between shadow roots and webelements would mean we could treat them similarly when a function might return either a shadow root or a web element and then whatever it returns we want to then search inside that element for another element, currently you need to treat them differently or not use keyword arguments.   If the ShadowRoot object was made public we would be able to monkeypatch functions within it, this can be useful for example we have a complicated dom structure where we want to search through elements and their shadow roots without needing to be too specific, e.g. find_element(By.NAME, 'publish-button') - This publish-button is unique on the page but we don't want to specify exactly which shadow root / element it is inside, in the past we have overwritten the find_element function to ignore certain shadow roots as they contain a lot of nested elements, which would take a long time.  Being able to import the NoSuchShadowRootException without getting warnings from your IDE would be a QOL change.  Being able to distinguish between a shadowroot becoming detached and the element not existing at all would be useful in error handling / retries.","closed","I-enhancement,","NickScottKortical","2021-12-10T11:50:11Z","2022-01-24T00:07:38Z"

"","10018","[🚀 Feature]: Recorded Video File Names","### Feature and motivation  In the current implementation of grid 4 video recording videos are saved using a file name that's determined at the start of the ffmpeg container while in a start grid configuration.  (Dynamic also works roughly the same way.)  The issue with this is that there's no great way to identify a video named ""video.mp4"", or even ""edge_video.mp4"" if one attempts to save that video to a mounted storage of any kind short of using some scripting to rename the generated video from the client side or something (which would be prone to all sorts of race conditions).  My thoughts on a solution for this would be to provide the video name to the video recording container when recording is started by the selenium session, passing the sessions sessionId as the file name.  Since this is visible to the client, it would allow easy linking a video the a given test run on the client side.  ### Usage example  Given a static grid where each video container mounts a shared storage directory... ```yaml --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: selenium-chrome-node-deployment   labels:     app: selenium-chrome-node     name: selenium-chrome-node     component: ""selenium-grid-4"" spec:   replicas: 10   selector:     matchLabels:       app: selenium-chrome-node   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: selenium-chrome-node         name: selenium-chrome-node         component: ""selenium-grid-4""     spec:       containers:         - name: video           image: selenium/video           resources:             limits:               memory: ""1Gi""               cpu: ""1""           volumeMounts:             - name: video               mountPath: /video         - name: selenium           image: selenium/node-chrome:latest           env:             - name: SE_EVENT_BUS_HOST               value: ""selenium-event-bus""             - name: SE_EVENT_BUS_PUBLISH_PORT               value: ""4442""             - name: SE_EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBE_PORT               value: ""4443""             - name: VNC_NO_PASSWORD               value: ""true""             - name: ""SE_OPTS""               value: ""--log-level FINE --grid-url https://selenium-grid.example.com""           ports:             - containerPort: 5553               protocol: TCP             - containerPort: 5555               protocol: TCP            volumeMounts:             - name: dshm               mountPath: /dev/shm           resources:             requests:               memory: ""1Gi""               cpu: ""1""             limits:               memory: ""1Gi""               cpu: ""1""       volumes:         - name: video           flexVolume:             driver: 'fstab/cifs'             fsType: 'cifs'             secretRef:               name: 'selenium-video'             options:               networkPath: '//examplefs/qa/selenium-videos'               mountOptions: 'dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777,vers=3.0,domain=EXAMPLEDOMAIN'         - name: dshm           emptyDir: { ""medium"": ""Memory"" } ```  Using ruby: ```ruby FILE_SERVER_PATH = '//examplefs/qa/selenium-videos/' @driver = Selenium::Webdriver.for :remote, url: 'selenium-grid.example.com', desired_capabilities: :chrome @session_id = @driver.session_id @video_file_path = ""#{FILE_SERVER_PATH}#{@driver.session_id}.mp4"" ```  From there it could be sent to any reporting aggregator of your choice for easy linking of video to test results, and managed (such as being removed in the event of a passing test or renamed to something more useful) entirely from the client side.","closed","I-enhancement,","LukeIGS","2021-11-09T13:15:31Z","2022-03-25T00:09:47Z"

"","10153","[🚀 Feature]: .har file export support for Chrome DevTools request/response objects","### Feature and motivation  I've just started using Selenium 4's Chrome DevTools integration and it's amazingly powerful. I found myself using it to capture request/response data while running a test, to be able to look through what happened API call-wise when a test fails.  However I don't see a clean way to export the request/response objects to a standardized file format, like that of .har file for easier consumption after.  I think adding in this feature would make the lives of people utilizing the request/response caps of Selenium 4 a whole lot easier, i.e. download the .har file from the test run, open it in a .har viewer or chrome dev tools, and very quickly inspect what went wrong, in a format they're used to viewing in general.  ### Usage example  As mentioned before, I can see testers keeping logs of requests/responses that happen during a test run, and if the test fails, logging that information as more detail to check why a test had failed. At the moment this would be either logging out specific parts of the request/response objects to a log file or worse to cli.  Adding in a way to easily write a list of request/response objects (or a way to capture all network traffic and do this export) would save testers time since they would not need to go re-run the test again and watch the network tab in their browser, or even worse try to replicate it by hand.

"","10845","[🚀 Feature]: Revisiting strong-named assemblies for NuGet (.NET Core/.NET)","### Feature and motivation  I'm aware that the current policy at Selenium is to distribute non-strong-named assemblies via NuGet and to make strong-named assemblies available only via a download site which is not a NuGet feed.  This is OK unless a developer wishes to create a package which: * Is to be distributed exclusively via NuGet * Depends upon Selenium * Is to be strong-named  Such a package cannot depend upon the Selenium NuGet packages because they are not strong-named, and a NuGet package cannot sensibly depend upon ""an out-of-band download site"".  I am aware that this issue/question has come up a few times over the past few years and I recall asking about it myself previously (possibly on IRC but it would have been at least 4 years ago).  What I'd like to do is prompt a revisit of the policy of ""No strong-named assemblies on NuGet"", given the current status of NuGet and .NET.  What problems need to be resolved to prompt a reversal of that policy?  Lots (perhaps the majority) of packages are released on NuGet with strong-named assemblies so it must be possible.  I seem to recall that at least part of the problem with strong-naming related to _assembly binding redirects_ in `App.config` files.  If that's the main pain-point then I have good news: _In .NET Core and .NET5+ App.config files and binding redirects are a thing of the past!_  The assembly binding/versioning rules are now much more sane.  This is going to mean that the audience who could be affected by issues is only going to decline as more projects upgrade to .NET Core or .NET5+.  But still - I suppose this feature request begins with a question:  What problems would need to be resolved in order to reverse the policy of having no strong-named binaries distributed via NuGet?  The next step is me taking a look to see if I can solve those problems.  ## Current workarounds A package which has to depend upon Selenium and is to be distributed via NuGet would have to either: * Forgo strong-naming * Bundle a copy of the Selenium strong-named binaries  For that second workaround, as far as I can tell the software license doesn't prevent this, but it's a bad solution because then the Selenium Version is tied to the package version.  Developers could not upgrade Selenium (even point releases) without upgrading the dependent package.  So, that's not a great solution either.  ### Usage example  I'm about to begin a revisit of [a package of my own].  I would like to distribute this via NuGet, it will require a dependency upon Screenplay and I would like to strong-name it.

These are the particular lines of code.  `List files = (List)var10000.map((xva$0) -> {                 return var10001.getLocalFile(new CharSequence[]{xva$0});             }).collect(Collectors.toList());             if (!files.isEmpty() && !files.contains((Object)null)) {                 allKeysToSend = (String)files.stream().map(this::upload).collect(Collectors.joining(""\n""));             }`   So, since we are giving a Folder path who contains all the files we want to upload there is no file explicit and the files.isEmpty() is failing, as it is expected. We try to give also one file present in the folder, but this is also not working since the folder browser is not accepting files only folder paths.         ### Usage example  The use of this feature will be upload the folder, with a variable number of filesz, making use of the folderBrowserDialog when we are working with RemoteMachines in Selenium grid.  Since it is working already in local machines will be nice if it work as well in remoteWebElement.","closed","needs-triaging,","gsangar","2022-05-18T10:28:04Z","2022-06-20T00:11:18Z"

"","10724","[🚀 Feature]: Consolidate Actions class features","### Feature and motivation  Did a comparative analysis of Actions class functionality between languages:  https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/actions_api/  #### Differences of note  * Python & Ruby can change default durations for scrolling & movement; Java & .NET can't * Python & Ruby have a ""move to Location"" method, Java & .NET don't * I just added support for Python & Ruby to specify what button to click on click and hold, release and click methods; Java & .NET don't have this * I added support for Java to & Ruby to set an ""active"" pointer (e.g. use a pen with Actions instead of needing ActionBuilder) Python & .NET can't do this * Pointer Event Properties require the Action Builder approach in Java/Python/.NET; * Java requires using Sequences instead of having a single ActionBuilder class like Python & .NET   #### Proposal 1: Allow setting default pointer in Python & .NET  This saves the step of needing to define the action and add to the input and then perform. Note: this example is Python, I haven't looked to see how difficult in .NET  ```python pen = ActionChains(driver)\     .set_pointer(PointerInput(POINTER_PEN, ""default pen""))\     .move_to(element)\     .perform() ```  #### Proposal 2: Move to Location method in Java & .NET Adds one method to Actions class Currently no option for moving based on Viewport origin, only Element origin The parameter could be x, y integers or a single  Coordinate/Point object instance  ```java new Actions(driver)         .moveToLocation(100, 200)         .perform() ```  #### Proposal 3: Allow changing of default duration in Java & .NET  Adds one constructor to Actions class Appium wants a default of 50ms instead of 250ms Putting it in Actions constructor is much lower impact than adding the parameter to each method **Discuss with Appium Devs First**  ```java new Actions(driver, Duration.ofMillis(50))         .moveByOffset(13, 15)         .perform(); ```  #### Proposal 4: Provide a better way to perform action sequences in Java  The `Collections.singletonList` requirement just feels clunky and unintuitive to me. It is extra overhead, and might be worth waiting to implement until after we do #10808 since that's where we're going to want to add multiple sequences.  instead of: ```java ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).perform(Collections.singletonList(actions)); ```  Wrap it with this: ```java new ActionsBuilder(driver)   .addSequence(actions)   .perform(); ```  #### Proposal 5: Allow PointerEvents to be used with Actions Convenience class  This would be lots more methods, and since PointerEvents are mostly not useful at this point, **I don't think we should do this one**  ```java PointerInput.PointerEventProperties eventProperties = PointerInput.eventProperties()         .setTiltX(-72)         .setTiltY(9)         .setTwist(86); new Actions(driver)         .setActivePointer(PointerInput.Kind.PEN, ""default pen"")         .moveToElement(pointerArea)         .clickAndHold()         .moveByOffset(2, 2, eventProperties)         .release()         .perform(); ```  #### Proposal 6: Specify Buttons  Add parameter for which button to click to `clickAndHold()`, `release()`, and `click()` (Java & .NET) Adds three methods to Actions class (which is a lot, so probably **we shouldn't do this one**) Note: this one is **probably not worth it** because the use cases are not that interesting.  ```java new Actions(driver)   .click(PointerInput.MouseButton.BACK)   .perform(); ```","open","I-enhancement,","titusfortner","2022-06-01T19:45:04Z","2022-07-20T18:44:51Z"

Background: In a normal project, it's easy to get full trace flow, just need start via same agent and send to same jaeger. no need set additional span or metric, just use as automatically way. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3264250/179277118-5c69448d-2b00-4fbb-84f6-576e76f5c287.png)  ``` https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/download/v1.15.0/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar https://github.com/alaahong/sia4-appium-sample/releases/download/opentelemetry-1/opentelemetry-1.jar https://github.com/alaahong/sia4-appium-sample/releases/download/opentelemetry-2/opentelemetry-2.jar ```  But we can't put Selenium into above flow with agent automatically too. 1. The Selenium trace record can't merge into Java Service automatically. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3264250/179279923-ad6484f5-7d27-4093-8f79-9ac55f669f76.png) 2. Even in Selenium, the trace will be splitting as request level, can't work as the scenario level.  So do we have the possible to combine Selenium OpenTelemetry evidence within transaction level (which means whole end to end execution, just like the java service client embed into java service host) or session level (which means Selenium execution level, not split into per request)?  Might be customized span can do this, but no code change is better.       ### Usage example Environment: opentelemetry-javaagent 1.15 Java 17 Windows 11 Selenium and Selenium Grid 4.3.0  Start jaeger ``` docker run -d --name jaeger   -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411   -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true   -p 6831:6831/udp   -p 6832:6832/udp   -p 9778:5778   -p 16686:16686   -p 4317:4317   -p 4318:4318   -p 14250:14250   -p 14268:14268   -p 14269:14269   -p 9411:9411   jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.36 ```   Start java service ``` java  -javaagent:""opentelemetry-javaagent.jar""  -D""otel.traces.exporter""=""jaeger"" -D""otel.exporter.jaeger.endpoint""=""http://localhost:14250"" -D""otel.resource.attributes""=""service.name=java-service-client"" -jar opentelemetry-1.jar --server.port=8081 --target-uri=""http://localhost:8082/api/hello?name=""  java  -javaagent:""opentelemetry-javaagent.jar""  -D""otel.traces.exporter""=""jaeger"" -D""otel.exporter.jaeger.endpoint""=""http://localhost:14250"" -D""otel.resource.attributes""=""service.name=java-service-host"" -jar opentelemetry-2.jar --server.port=8082 --""target-uri""=""http://localhost:8081/api/hello?name="" ```  Start Grid with same agent and jaeget ``` java   -javaagent:""opentelemetry-javaagent.jar""  -D""otel.traces.exporter""=""jaeger"" -D""otel.exporter.jaeger.endpoint""=""http://localhost:14250"" -D""otel.resource.attributes""=""service.name=selenium-standalone""  -jar selenium-server-4.3.0.jar  --ext $(coursier fetch -p io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger:1.15.0 io.grpc:grpc-netty:1.45.0) standalone --tracing false  ``` Test Code ``` public class OpenTelemetryTest {    protected WebDriver driver;    @BeforeAll   static void setupClass() {     WebDriverManager.chromedriver()             .setup();   }    @BeforeEach   void setupTest() throws MalformedURLException {     ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();     driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(""http://localhost:4444""), options);   }    @Test   public void openTelemetryTest() {     driver.get(""http://localhost:8081/"");     driver.findElement(By.id(""hello"")).sendKeys(""test"");     driver.findElement(By.xpath(""//input[@type='submit']"")).click();     Assertions.assertThat(driver.findElement(By.tagName(""h1"")).getText())             .isEqualTo(""Hello TEST"");   }    @AfterEach   void teardown() {     if (driver != null) {       driver.quit();     }   } } ```","open","I-enhancement,","alaahong","2022-07-15T17:45:04Z","2022-08-03T21:43:41Z"
"","10541","[🚀 Feature]: Add virtual authenticator support for all Selenium language bindings","### Feature and motivation  Applications often integrate WebAuthn as part of the login step. This triggers a WebAuthn browser-specific WebAuthn flow.  Example of WebAuthn in Chrome:    Automating interaction with the WebAuthn dialog, as shown above, is possible via the extension VirtualAuthenticator APIs defined as part of https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-automation.   ### Implementation Implementation for Java was added as part of https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/7760 and https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/7842. The rest of the language bindings need to add the relevant code and can refer to the Java implementation for guidance.  An outline of implementing VirtualAuthenticator 1. [VirtualAuthenticatorOptions](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/virtualauthenticator/VirtualAuthenticatorOptions.java) (this is used when adding the VirtualAuthenticator)  2. [Credential](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/virtualauthenticator/Credential.java) (The credentials to be used by the VirtualAuthenticator) 3. List of methods (which call the WebDriver commands) and the respective parameters required:   -  addVirtualAuthenticator(VirtualAuthenticatorOptions options) - Returns an authenticator id as a string - removeVirtualAuthenticator (String authenticatorId) - addCredential(Credential credential, String authenticatorId) - getCredentials(String authenticatorId) - Returns a Map - removeCredential(byte[] credentialId, String authenticatorId) - removeCredential(String credentialId, String authenticatorId) - removeAllCredentials(String authenticatorId)  - setUserVerified(boolean verified, String authenticatorId) Refer:  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/b1fafa7ead771bfe70b659cf96d1f29cb22a2605/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.java#L654 https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/b1fafa7ead771bfe70b659cf96d1f29cb22a2605/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.java#L1158  Tests are defined in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/java/test/org/openqa/selenium/virtualauthenticator/VirtualAuthenticatorTest.java  Note: Currently, only chromium-based browsers implement the WebAuthn APIs. Though Java does not do it, till the rest of the vendors implement it might be a good idea for the VirtualAuthenticator APIs to sit in the chromium section of each binding (similar to the current implementation of Permissions API).  **C#**  It can follow the Java implementation since both are strongly typed. C# binding has similar interface declarations as Java for existing features (example: HasPermissions).  **Ruby**  All extension APIs are defined in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/39dec028673260e8a9518898fe40a910426adc85/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/driver_extensions. Similarly, `has_virtualauthenticator` interface can be implemented and added here and used in the chromium module.   **Python**  Chromium-specific Selenium commands in python are in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/chromium/webdriver.py VirtualAuthenticator commands can be added here and authentication id can be defined as a local variable.   **Javascript** Chromium-specific Selenium commands in javascript are in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/chromium.js VirtualAuthenticator commands can be added here and authentication id can be defined as a local variable.   ### Usage example  A sample java example:  ```     WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();         HasVirtualAuthenticator virtualAuthenticatorManager = ((HasVirtualAuthenticator) driver);      VirtualAuthenticatorOptions options = new VirtualAuthenticatorOptions();     options.setIsUserConsenting(true);     options.setProtocol(VirtualAuthenticatorOptions.Protocol.U2F);     options.setTransport(VirtualAuthenticatorOptions.Transport.USB);          VirtualAuthenticator authenticator = virtualAuthenticatorManager.addVirtualAuthenticator(options);     authenticator.setUserVerified(true); ```","open","I-enhancement,","pujagani","2022-04-13T13:23:44Z","2022-07-20T14:13:00Z"

Not much has changed from NET 5 to NET 6 in terms of required source changes, however .NET 6 lists Visual Studio 2022 as a requirement so keep that in mind.  ### Usage example  I was able to successfully update the following projects and build .NET 6 DLLs from Visual Studio 2022:  - WebDriver - WebDriver.Support - WebDriverBackedSelenium  Rough steps on updating project to support .NET 6 (**Note** VS2022 is required for full .NET 6 support):  1. Install latest .NET 6.0 SDK and latest Visual Studio 2022 2. Edit each project and nuspec file to specify `net6.0` where applicable. 3. Edit preprocessor directives in relevant sources to include `NET6_0_OR_GREATER` (or `NET6_0`) where applicable or you will encounter an error when building sources that use system drawing methods (like screenshotting)   You may be able to get around installing VS2022, if one were to just perform the above changes and then build with the NET 6 SDK installed, however I have not tried this myself so cannot speak to how this workaround might work.","open","I-enhancement,","cgv-wd","2022-03-22T15:08:29Z","2022-03-22T22:54:12Z"

This is useful for single purpose selenium scripts where the user is creating and using a driver once to accomplish a specific task.  If any step of the task fails (i.e., throws an uncaught exception) the driver will be automatically closed. 1. Using the `with` statement is idiomatic for resources (files, network connections, etc) that must be cleaned up in some way after use    ### Usage example  ```python with webdriver.Chrome(options=options, service=service) as driver:     # use the driver     driver.find_element(By.ID, ""foo"")      # when this block exits, driver.quit() is automatically called ```","closed","I-enhancement,","mmindenhall","2022-01-25T00:54:14Z","2022-03-20T00:09:55Z"
"","10861","[🚀 Feature]: How to use Selenium to launch Brave browser with adblock on for C#?","### Feature and motivation   Hello: I have been using Brave browser for quite a number of years, with the brave browser, I can skip almost all kinds of ads on internet. Recently, I want to write some C# code to use selenium to do some translation job on some web sites, unfortunately, there are so many ads on the web site, selenium always failed, as it can’t see the element hidden by all kinds of ads. When I launch Brave browser by hand and visit the translation web site, I can see all the ads are gone, so it is rather clean. I think if I can launch Brave browser with Selenium, then I can get a clean web site, so my C# selenium code could run. So I installed some NUGET packages: PM> Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver -Version 4.3.0 PM> Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver -Version 103.0.5060.5300 PM> Install-Package Selenium.Support -Version 4.3.0 The following is my C# code:   try  {      Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(""webdriver.chrome.driver"", chromeDriverPath);      ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new()      {          BinaryLocation = braveBrowserPath       };      Brave_Driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions);      Brave_Driver.Url = ""https://edition.cnn.com/"";  }  catch (Exception ex)  {      Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);  } I can see that selenium can launch Brave browser, but the home page, which is from CCN web site, has a lot of ads, and I tried different web pages, still all the ads are there.  It makes Brave browser useless.  Using Chrome browser is the same, tons of ads appear on the web page, some times, those ads occupy 90% or more space on the screen, it is difficult to run C# selenium code to do the job. If I don’t want to use some ad-block extensions, only use Brave browser, how I can keep all the ads away? Please advise if I did something wrong, or it is possible with Selenium with C#. Thanks,   ### Usage example  try  {      Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(""webdriver.chrome.driver"", chromeDriverPath);      ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new()      {          BinaryLocation = braveBrowserPath       };      Brave_Driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions);      Brave_Driver.Url = ""https://edition.cnn.com/"";  }  catch (Exception ex)  {      Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);  } Just use the code or add some parameter, so the ads are gone as I use Brave browser by hand.","closed","I-question,","zydjohnHotmail","2022-07-10T16:04:59Z","2022-07-11T04:40:17Z"

"","10358","[py] Add support for http proxy authentication to remote_connection","### Description Currently, `urllib3.ProxyManager` is used when connecting to a Selenium Server via http proxy. The proxy url is read from environment variables.  Some http proxies require authentication. Credentials are usually passed in the url like this: http://username:password@proxy.com:8080  When specifying a url like this and passing it into the ProxyManager's `proxy_url` attribute, the ProxyManager is not able to authenticate to the proxy and a ProxyError is thrown: `ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', OSError('Tunnel connection failed: 407 Proxy Authentication Required'))`  Instead ProxyManager uses a `proxy_header` field for authentication, which can take a `proxy-authorization` header that is then used to authenticate to the http proxy.  This PR implements support for this header. If credentials are specified in the proxy url like shown above, they are seperated out. They are then used to create a HTTP basic proxy-authorization header using the [urllib3.util.make_headers](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.util.html#urllib3.util.make_headers) method provided by urllib3. The credentials are removed from the url and the ProxyManager object is created using the url without credentials and the authorization header.  If a regular url is passed in without credentials, no auth header is specified and the ProxyManager is created as it was before.  ### Motivation and Context  It is currently not possible to connect to a Selenium Server behind an http proxy that requires authentication using the Python Remote Webdriver. This problem is solved here, as credentials can now be specified in the proxy url using the following standardized format: http://username:password@proxy.com:8080 This feature is already present in other Selenium implementations (I tested it in Ruby), and this adds support for Python as well.    ### Types of changes  - [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) - [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)  ### Checklist   - [x] I have read the [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. - [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [x] I have added tests to cover my changes. - [x] All new and existing tests passed.

"","10202","[py] make mypy only complain about stuff that matters","### Description  This PR disables the mypy checks that don't matter for a codebase that is only beginning to adopt type checks, in the hopes that flagrantly incorrect annotations such as the ones fixed in #10120 and #10172 can be avoided. It also fixes a number of other very wrong annotations, although not all of them. Some would be hard to fix without removing them entirely, refactoring, or breaking backwards compatibility, and I did not want to do that here without raising it first.  One thing I think I'd suggest as a useful refactor would be turning `Keys` and `By` into `Enum`s or something similar., to help with issues like those mypy still raises about `shadowroot.py`.  Coverage appears to be decreased by this, but I'm not sure what value a coverage report for a check that is mostly throwing errors has. Once the stragglers are sorted, it'd be nice to make the mypy CI job fail when the checks fail (although I'm not sure if CI failures are just to be expected in this codebase).  ~Also, one of the things mypy is complaining about is that `WheelInput` is given too many arguments in `action_builder.ActionBuilder.add_wheel_input`, which I'm confused about. Is there some magic I'm missing, or is this just a method that isn't working at the moment?~ raised in #10210  ### Motivation and Context  I [observed in a comment](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/10172#issuecomment-998688391) that the errors that have been made in the existing annotations are completely understandable given how overwhelmingly noisy the current mypy checks are. In an existing codebase, complaining about stuff like missing return annotations is pointless; all you really want to do is [add annotations as you work on stuff](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/existing_code.html#write-annotations-as-you-go) and make sure that what you _do_ add is correct.  Incorrect annotations are way, way worse than no annotations.  ### Types of changes - [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)  ### Checklist - [x] I have read the [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. - [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - [ ] All new and existing tests passed.","open","C-py,","colons","2021-12-30T16:36:27Z","2022-05-24T23:01:00Z"

"","10643","Add __all__ to __init__.py to make imports public","### Description  Add __all__ variable to webdriver.__init__.py with a reference to all imports to make them public.  ### Motivation and Context  `pyright` throws a ""private import"" error when using e.g. `webdriver.Chrome` From the `pyright` docs [here](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/typed-libraries.md): > Imported symbols are considered private by default. If they use the “import A as A” (a redundant module alias), “from X import A as A” (a redundant symbol alias), or “from . import A” forms, symbol “A” is not private unless the name begins with an underscore. If a file __init__.py uses the form “from .A import X”, symbol “A” is not private unless the name begins with an underscore (but “X” is still private). If a wildcard import (of the form “from X import *”) is used, all symbols referenced by the wildcard are not private. A module can expose an __all__ symbol at the module level that provides a list of names that are considered part of the interface. The __all__ symbol indicates which symbols are included in a wildcard import. All symbols included in the __all__ list are considered public even if the other rules above would otherwise indicate that they were private. For example, this allows symbols whose names begin with an underscore to be included in the interface.  Redundant aliases seem to only work if the name isn't being changed. I'm no type expert, so there might be a ""cleaner"" solution, but this works.  ### Types of changes  - [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)  ### Checklist   - [x] I have read the [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. - [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - [ ] All new and existing tests passed.","closed","C-py,","hudcap","2022-05-13T16:30:19Z","2022-05-23T22:05:36Z"

However, since [there is `ensure` at the method level in the `stop` method](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/service_manager.rb#L69-L71), the `stop_process` method is called even after [the process exit checking in the `stop` method](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/service_manager.rb#L63). To prevent `NoMethodError`, I would like to add `return if process_exited?` to the beginning of the `stop_process` method.  simple example: ```ruby class Foo   def bar     if @process.nil?       puts 'A'       return     end      puts 'B'   ensure     puts 'C'     @process.stop   end end  f = Foo.new f.bar ```  ```sh $ ruby foo.rb A C foo.rb:11:in `bar': undefined method `stop' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)      @process.stop             ^^^^^         from foo.rb:16:in `' ```  ### Motivation and Context   Same as https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pull/10015.

The issues were:    - Options were wrapped in an `options` key when chromedriver expected     them to be at the top-level of the parameters dict (see [here](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/chrome/test/chromedriver/window_commands.cc#L2246))   - Page size options were put into a `pageSize` key, when chromedriver     expected it to be a `page` key (see [here](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/chrome/test/chromedriver/window_commands.cc#L539))   - The `Orientation` enum was serialized incorrectly (uppercase), while chromedriver is expecting the values to be all lowercase (see [here](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/chrome/test/chromedriver/window_commands.cc#L466-L467))  Also, using the `PageSize` class supplied by selenium was not possible, due to defaulting to constant page sizes, not allowing the consumer to override them. This was addressed by adding a second constructor allowing to specify height/width.  All tests were performed against a v96 chromedriver.  ### Types of changes  - [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)  ### Checklist   - [x] I have read the [contributing](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. - [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation. - [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly. - [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes. - [x] All new and existing tests passed.","closed","","dennisoelkers","2022-04-05T11:32:01Z","2022-04-08T07:23:24Z"

In projects with a plugin system, this can lead to problems, when selenium dependencies are part of a jar file that is not on the class path the application was started with. For these projects, using selenium results in a `ClassNotFoundException` when the first remote call is performed.  To fix this, using the class loader of the factory interface would be beneficial.

"","10628","[py]: Initial implementation of linting in CI","# New Python Linting  Here's typically how this stuff will work for now, since we do not want `pre-commit` put in place; this utilises `tox` which currently handles our `flake8` stuff.  Main difference here is that both `black` and `isort` will _rewrite_ files which are violating our rules, these will be *unstaged* and require you to re-stage the fixed versions however the python code base will be uniform across the board which is vital, we will also have less merge conflicts with more keeping more to a single line (e.g imports etc).  This adds the following to a new `tox -e linting` recipe; formerly `tox -e flake8` (specifically).   - `flake8`.  - `isort` for consistent import management.  - `black` for a consistent code base throughout all contributors.  Github actions have been updated as part of this work and will fail just like `flake8` currently does when things are not uniform.  Tools are now configured via the `setup.cfg` file for everything, we should consider moving to a `pyproject.toml` in future; but we use `bazel` so do not follow a normal 'python packaging' setup.  I have been adding commit hashes that do sweeping linting changes to `.git-blame-ignore-revs` which can be used in conjunction with `git blame` for checking who was responsible for what changes originally without everything coming back as me with the original changes.  Typical working flow:   - Branch off `trunk` and do some work  - Prior to committing; `tox -e linting`  - If tox linting is not exiting `0` due to changes in `black` or `isort` those files will be *unstaged* and amended automatically, re-stage them and apply `tox -e linting` again until it is good (this is handled automatically by `pre-commit` which is why I was pushing this so strongly)  - `flake8` fixes will manually need resolved as they currently do  We are so far away from having a good `mypy` coverage but we can work towards it in future and consider adding it into the `tox -e linting` recipe.  **Negatives** (for now):   - Since we are allowing pushing without enforcing the stuff is good; remote side can error so `--no-verify` is not a valid work around, I don't really see that as a big 'negative' at all but something to be aware of.  # Outstanding tasks:  - Make CI apply it and not only `flake8`.  - Black requires a `toml`  - Should this only run against _staged_ files?  - Ensure `git blame` is not impacted by the initial rewriting commits.  - Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect the workflow for new contributors  - various other teething issues","closed","C-py,","symonk","2022-05-09T23:01:43Z","2022-06-11T08:58:35Z"
"","10820","[🚀 Feature]: Send delete to geckodriver on timeout","# Background As you may know, there is a long [standing issue with geckodriver](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1430064) that _Firefox does not exit when geckodriver is terminated_. The issue does not surface when a normal session close/quit is performed. In this case, a DELETE is sent to geckodriver and Firefox is shut down. However, if a session times out, `OsProcess#destroy` kills geckodriver only with an OS signal. And due to the aforementioned issue, Firefox itself is not killed.  Ideally, the geckodriver bug would be fixed. However, since it is a 5 year old bug with resolution being postponed from release to release I don't think this will be resolved in geckodriver itself any time soon.  # Proposal The geckodriver codebase is not anywhere near my skillset, but the Selenium codebase is. If appreciated, I would like to contribute a fix such that `org.openqa.selenium.remote.service.DriverService#stop` is changed such that in the `GeckoDriverService` a ""hook"" is called to shut down geckodriver _and_ Firefox by sending a DELETE to the session.  Note that the `` already contains related code: ``` URL killUrl = new URL(url.toString() + ""/shutdown""); new UrlChecker().waitUntilUnavailable(3, SECONDS, killUrl); ``` However, geckodriver does not have such a `/shutdown` endpoint. An approach could be to factor this code out into a separate method and to override it in `GeckoDriverService` by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the `/{session-id}` endpoint.  # DELETE on stop as default behaviour? Note that I don't really know why this isn't default behaviour. `org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.ProtocolConvertingSession` already always forwards DELETE requests. But maybe there are other implementations that I'm not aware of though.","open","help wanted,","frensjan","2022-06-27T21:49:41Z","2022-07-06T05:30:25Z"
