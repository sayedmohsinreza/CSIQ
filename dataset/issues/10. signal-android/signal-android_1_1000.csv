"","11759","When saving media files to disk (video/photo).  Wrong message pops up: ""saved in media""","When saving media files to disk (video/photo).  Wrong message pops up: ""`saved in media`""  The problem is that Android has a directory `/data/media` and `/storage/emulated/0/media`, and when checking these directories, the downloaded video files are not found.   The documentation also lacks information where the media files are downloaded and you have to manually search for the directory with the saved data (exactly the path).    Solution to the problem: when saving files to disk, instead of ""`saved in media`"" specify the explicit directory :: ""`saved in /storage/emulated/0/Movies`"".

"","11614","Large images displayed in incorrect orientation","When receiving high dimension photos from one of my contacts (iPhone X), the photos show in the correct orientation when in the thumbnail but are rotated 90 degrees when tapped on to show full screen.  Other users in our group chat who are on Android also see the same issue when receiving these images, but users on iOS don't see the issue.  This suggests it's something to do with the way the Signal App on Android is parsing orientation data.  When receiving images from users on older iPhones we don't see the issue on Android.  I've not been through with the debugger yet but read through what I think are the relevant bits of code..  **Version**: 5.22.8  This line in ZoomingImageView sets the orientation mode to be set from EXIF data: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/v5.22.8/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/ZoomingImageView.java#L69  The image dimensions are over 2048 px in height and so subsampling is used: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/v5.22.8/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/ZoomingImageView.java#L108  This calls setImage on the SubsamplingImageView: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/v5.22.8/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/ZoomingImageView.java#L131  I'm not really sure what goes wrong next.. it must be possible to calculate the correct orientation as it is correct in the thumbnail.

When using Signal's built in emojis (they look like iOS but I'm using Android equivalents here), sometimes a laughing face (üòÇ) turns into a fish (üê†) once the message is received on the other end. It also gets rid of a space after the emoji if it's there, but I've had it happen at the end of messages. This occurs for both users, even if the receiver is on iOS. This is now the 4th or 5th time. The 1st time happened about a year ago, and the last time it happened (before just now) was yesterday. It has only ever happened to messages I send, never from anyone else.

"","12236","Security issues with group chat functionality","Signal presents itself as a secure messaging tool and undoubtedly a lot of care has been spent on its encryption design. It is also common knowledge that Signal is being used a lot in political and activist groups, both in more repressive states as well as in more liberal states. Even in liberal states certain political topics are repressed by the authorities and individuals can become targets of surveillance, physical searches etc. if their their affiliation to certain groups becomes known to state  actors. A lot of these individuals rely on Signal to organize but are often not knowlegeable about the differences between security and anonymity.  Unfortunately it is not clearly communciated in the App that you should only use Signal with people you absolutely trust.  Joining any group will share your phone number will all members of this group. It many countries a phone number can be used by state actors both to deanonymize individuals. Additionally any contact who you have written ever before can add you to a group, thereby sharing your number with a large number of others without your consent. So if there is a group organizing or sharing information about a certain political topic it takes only a single compromised account to enumerate all group members. State actors could also monitor phone numbers known to belong to activists through other sources, wait for one of these numbers to become deactivated or recycled by a telecom provider and capture that number through the telcom provider in order to claim the Signal account.   Since groups are allowed to be up to 1000 individuals each, it cannot be expected for any individual to know and trust each single member. Much easier than technological attacks would be social engineering strategies in order to insert a bad-faith-actor into a group. Alternatively state actors could also seize a single phone of the group in order to uncover the identity of all members of the group. So the whole security of a group dependens on: - All members of the group can be trusted to not be bad faith actors (easier with small groups, harder with large groups) - All members are using Signal itself only on devices which are strongly encrypted and devices are never left unattended (impossible to ensure for any group larger than a few people)  This means that the current group design puts the responsibility or burden of security on each member and should just a single member make a security slip-up the safety of all other members are under threat. There a many discussions on why placing the burden of security on the enduser often leads to slip-ups and Signal itself seems to have adopted a ""Security-be-default"" approach in many areas. This is also being reflected by the website stating: ""Privacy isn‚Äôt an optional mode ‚Äî it‚Äôs just the way that Signal works.""   I believe that from a privacy and security perspective an explicit opt-in is needed to join a group and to share your details with the whole group. People who you have written before should not have the power to disclose you number to a group which you were not previously part of. It seems best for me if joining a group and disclosing your details to all members would be two different steps, and the first not reliant on the later.","closed","","tzugen","2022-05-07T08:19:14Z","2022-05-09T19:53:54Z"

This payment system called ""MobileCoin"" has burrowed technology from the Monero project including subaddresses and RingCT. The devs for MobileCoin claim it is based on CryptoNote even though CryptoNote does not even have those features. Any payment system that can block users based on their geographic location is not an open and permission-less distributed network. Monero and Bitcoin are permission-less.  If Monero, the only real privacy oriented payment system, is too slow for the Signal devs, they could have easily waited for Taproot, Schnorr and MAST to make Lightning Network payments a totally private and instant alternative. This shamelss cash grab is very upsetting and I hope Moxie gets his head straight.

It might shows the warning to users who maybe intentionally put their phone offline for long periods (over night, during a flight etc). For this reason I limited the ""megaphone"" to appear a maximum of 7 days...  Background: The workaround cannot distinguish if Signal was forced to sleep by Android, or if user intentionally went offline. (Maybe a potential solution to overcome this limitation would be: Maybe checking logcat -> ConnectivityService -> to check if ""DISCONNECT / CONNECT"" happened since Signal was in foreground the last time before)  - Further details and user experiences described at SignalCommunity: https://community.signalusers.org/t/severe-notification-issue-please-implement-suggested-workarounds/37732  - !

Very annoying","My gf and I like to record and send videos back and forth, but increasingly recently, it seems like when playing a video in Signal, when a new Signal notification comes in, the video glitches and restarts. Not every notification, and I'm still trying to figure out what kind of notifications, but one of the most consistent is when she sends a new video while I'm watching her previous one. So, new video notifications seem to be a fairly consistent trigger for this bug. I've talked to her about it, and she's confirmed that it has been happening for her too. If it helps to narrow it down, I would say this started happening within the past month or so. She says it's been the past week, so maybe different update schedules. I don't know, but we've been using Signal for almost a year now, and it's only recently that this has been happening.  Feel free to let me know if there's anything I can do to try and help narrow this down.  We're both on Android. I'm on a Galexy S10e running Andoid 11.

"","12021","Group chats need a notification cooldown","Looks like this was covered by https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6759 but never addressed.  Signal is great - but in my opinion one of the few features it is missing is that busy group chats really **need** some kind of notification cooldown on them.   WhatsApp does this, but Signal seems to have nothing at all. You can mute for time periods, but other than that it is going to send a notification for every single message in a group chat which means once a conversation kicks off I essentially need to mute notifications for 1 hour just to not have my phone go off every 15 seconds.  There really needs to be some kind of backoff with this, like notifying for the first two messages and then not again for that group chat for 5 minutes or something, and if you have not checked the chat and a new message comes in after 5 minutes then wait 5 minutes again until you look at that chat and then it all resets.  It honestly feels like a bug that this doesn't exist because it makes the app extremely annoying for any reasonably sized group chat to the point that it's one of the main things in our group that makes people want to use WhatsApp instead.","closed","","pet0ruk","2022-02-25T09:39:41Z","2022-03-14T19:43:01Z"

For example ""Current weather in Dallas"". The question is, how far can this be taken? Can I compel you to send me a link preview of a website which encrypts your IP address and spits it out in a manner which will be echoed back to me in a link preview, so the sender is compromising his location without even knowing it? Or does this not work because the link preview is generated by Signal's own CDN, in which case the best I can do is to discover your locale, which is the locale of the nearest Signal CDN? I don't know enough to comment, but the lesser threat is readily reproducible.  ### Steps to reproduce  Go to a site which serves localized content, ideally embedded in the page title or close to the top of  the page. Send a link to the site to a friend. (The home page will do. You don't need anything obvious like example.com/dallas)  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Your friend will see the content localized to you, not to them.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Link previews should be independently resolved at both ends. So I see Dallas and you see Sydney.  I suppose the other option is just to give up and tell me that some degree of location compromise is unavoidable, and routing calls through Signal servers doesn't help because we're not talking about calls here. Speaking of which, I have to wonder whether those servers are also somewhat localized, so I can roughly approximate your location from the IPs stamped on the relayed packets. I don't know.  ### Device info  I've tried this with a number of friends recently. The only commonality seems to be Android. It always happens as described.","closed","","sailbird","2022-04-16T18:48:41Z","2022-04-16T20:09:56Z"

In short: Signal currently uses `MediaPlayer` for the ringtone. That results in a number of issues, such as #5503: the Do Not Disturb function handles it as media rather than an incoming call. That's quite a limitation.

This signal database was special for many reasons, including containing the messages between me and my now deceased long time friend.  This phone was not active any longer.  When I first tried to make a backup, everything looked to be working.  When I clicked the button to create a backup, nothing happened.  HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE AN ERROR MESSAGE?  After hours of troubleshooting, I reconnected the phone number and the backup was ‚Äúworking‚Äù ‚Äî except it wasn‚Äôt, and I received no message or indication that it failed.  I transferred the backup off my phone to an ext4 filesystem and reformatted the phone with lineage.  When I went to restore the backup, it failed.  The backup was corrupted, you see, it was missing over a gb of data.  After investigating, I realized what happened: the backup seems to have terminated early because it was over 4.1gb or so, or the limit for a fat32 system.  There was no error, no indication, only something saying it was successful.  I have now lost the last words I had from a dear friend along with countless conversations, voice messages, and pictures.  I managed to restore some of the database but most of the metadata is gone and it is a massive mess, along with significant data loss.  As an organization funded in the millions, this is an embarrassment that such amateur code made it to release.  If I had known how bad it was, I would have never formatted and manually transferred the data.  It makes me question the integrity of the entire codebase.

In my case the phone-company have already turned off the phonenumber. If you try to call the phone number, you get the information, that the phone number does not exist. This is for me the perfect situation because i can give to the people a signal-only number and this protects me so that the people cant create unencrypted meta-data or even general data by using their phone number to send me unencrypted SMS-messages. I always told the people to NEVER make a unencrypted call (i never answered any, but call still creates meta-data). The people still used the phone number to try to make a unencrypted call over the phone company after i had told them not to do that.  After a few months of police brutality and prison in a country with broken law and jurisdiction, i was financially broke and the phone-number was shut off because of missing payments. Now i have the situation where other people can only contact me with Signal and the people are not able to contact me without encryption - and this is from the security perspective a positive thing. But how can i transfer this Signal-only phone number to a new phone? https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages > Your new device  can receive a SMS or call to complete registration.

"","11364","[Bug] Potential Issue With Connection On Mobile Data With Low Range","I frequent an area in which I am there for a few hours often. When there, I have around a low-mediumlow signal strength on mobile data. I presume as I walk around, it completely cuts off and loses signal when in my pocket, I know there are a few areas in the building which it does.  I notice whenever I am in this area, even with it showing 4/5 bars (I know this is arbitrary), I can't seem to send, or recieve anything through Signal. When sending, it just shows it's sending forever. I have found a workaround, restarting the phone (without moving) seems to allow it to send. However a minute later the same issue happens. It's hard to pinpoint.  Now, it is worth noting I have zero issues with connections in ANY other app, besides Signal, even when Signal is having issues (except for the areas where I get zero reception). Some other apps may be a bit slow, but nothing refuses or has much trouble more than waiting a few seconds due to poor signal. This is why it confuses me, it seems to be only an issue with Signal. I've tried fresh installing Signal, and factory resetting my phone, it doesn't seem to make a difference.  When leaving this poor signal area (driving away), and going into a excellent signal area, Signal seems to continuously have the connection issue, UNLESS I restart the phone. Then it seems to stay working while driving and elsewhere. Other apps just speed back up due to better reception.  I notice zero issues when on Wi-Fi, even with low signal due to being far from the access point. At most it takes a few seconds due to low speed.  Not sure what's going on, but I can't imagine Signal should be having a hard time when other apps like Telegram have no issues.  Android 10, LGv40, T-Mobile, 5.12.3 Signal-FOSS [(tw-hx)](https://github.com/tw-hx/Signal-Android/); same issue occurs on the official Signal apk for me.","closed","wontfix,","seniorm0ment","2021-06-03T14:16:49Z","2022-02-02T05:09:48Z"

Developers have now really ignored this for so long that this even makes no sense to repeat as they are not going to so this unless they go back to their roots and begin taking privacy seriously again.  Imagine this.  You are having some sensitive conversation and don‚Äôt want to reveal the number of the person you‚Äôre talking to! This situation can be as simple as exchanging some personal messages to sharing some important revelation!  According to Signal, only way to delete is to block a contact but then again same contact stays there under a block list. Does this look like a solution? Transferring from conract list to block list is not a deletion.  Countless articles and requests are made for this feature to be introduced and all the developers have done nothing but to show us a middle finger labelling this as a feature request and not paying attention to serious consequences one can be put through for such lapse as depicted in above example.  There are many ways too. Delete the app! Uninstall and reinstall the app. They are workaround not solution! Nobody should have to do all such in order to delete a contact! A delete must mean delete. And a block doesn‚Äôt mean delete! Blocked can have their own block list but a delete must retain what it implies. Complete deletion of data.  You have no right to hold users contact info after a user makes a delete request. You‚Äôre holding data against their will!  To all the developers: Wake up!  Edit: This genuine expressive post was flagged and and made hidden. This is now a dictatorship? This is a clear violation of free speech.","closed","","desmonk","2022-03-13T05:19:45Z","2022-03-14T16:20:37Z"

"","12071","Screen Lock privacy setting greyed out/unavailable on Android 12 in Dual Messenger/App mode","Hello,  The Screen Lock function in the Privacy settings is not available (greyed out) in Signal v5.32.15 on Android 12 in Dual Messenger (Dual App) mode. This option is visible in dark grey color, and no action is possible to activate it, it is indeed disabled and unavailable.  This option was available and working properly on Android 11 in Dual Messenger/App mode on Samsung phones until the Android 12 upgrade which happened 2 months ago for me.  The Dual Messenger mode for Signal was enabled as follow (on Android 11, before the 12 update): https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/add-non-messenger-apps-to-samsung-dual-messenger.3817250/  Step 1: Enable Dual Messenger for an existing app (e.g. WhatsApp). Step 2: Enable USB Debugging and connect your device to your computer. Step 3: Open command prompt in your adb folder. Step 4: Type Code:  adb shell  Step 5: Type Code:  pm list users  Step 6: In the resulting list, find the user named ""DUAL_APP"" and get its number. For example, the number is 95 on my device: Code:  UserInfo{95:DUAL_APP:20000030} running  Step 7: Type Code:  exit  Step 8: Copy your desired apk file to your adb folder. Step 9: Type Code:  adb install --user 95 desired_app.apk  Remember to replace ""95"" with whatever number you saw in Step 6.  Wait for the process to finish. A SUCCESS message should be displayed.  The app of your choice will now be installed in Dual Messenger.","closed","wontfix,","Deenniss","2022-03-16T16:26:01Z","2022-05-23T03:01:43Z"

"","11950","Notifications on Phone not Clearing When Messages are Read on the Desktop App","Bug description  Post-upgrade to Android 12 on my Pixel 4a, banner notifications and notification bubbles on my phone no longer disappear after the messages/reactions are read on my Signal Desktop app (Windows 11). When read on my phone, the notification number on the desktop app's taskbar icon disappears, and the message/reaction shows as read in the desktop app which is normal behavior.  Steps to reproduce  - Receive notification from Signal. - Read message on Signal Desktop. (Application can be open or closed before receiving message/reaction.) - Notification remains populated on phone or populates on the phone if the conversation was open on the desktop app when the message/reaction arrives and was automatically marked as read when received on the desktop. - Opening the Android app to the messages list shows that the message has been read but still does not clear the banner notification. You must actually open the message, either from selecting the banner notification or the conversation list, to clear the banner notification. - The desktop app has been removed and re-linked several times and both devices have been rebooted several times over the past 6 days since this started.  Actual result: Signal message notifications on Android 12 persist even when they have been read on the desktop app until you open the conversation in the Android app.  Expected result: When a message is opened on either device, the notification on the other device should clear.

Often, when I turn off airplane mode in the morning, and try to send a message, it fails. It just hangs with the spinner.  This isn‚Äôt a new issue. I‚Äôve noticed this for several months. So it's not related to a specific version it seems, as i've updated the app multiple times between.  If I restart the phone, then I get the error that it failed to send. I‚Äôm guessing a force stop would probably work too, but haven‚Äôt tried it. Just putting airplane mode on for a minute or 2 doesn‚Äôt seem to be a problem. But after being on for 8 hours or so, it seems to cause an issue.  ### Steps to reproduce - Turn airplane mode on - Turn airplane mode off - Send a message. I'm not sure if the length of time in airplane mode is relevant.  It seems to be, since toggling it for a minute or two doesn't seem to be a problem.  **Actual result:**  Message does not send.  It just hangs with the spinner instead of checkmarks.  It does not resolve itself if you wait.  **Expected result:**  Send message successfully. (shows checkmarks, no error)  ### Screenshots I'll get a screenshot next time it happens.   ### Device info  **Device:** LG G8X ThinQ **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.28.10  ### Link to debug log I'll have to get this next time it happens.","closed","wontfix,","DjIronArm","2022-01-28T21:15:28Z","2022-04-10T22:31:59Z"

If a sticker's duration is 5 seconds the playback will loop the sticker in under a second. Only some stickers are affected by this even in the same sticker pack, see the example screen recording: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1360989/130343368-404fb303-ddc8-4d7b-bd7d-6c65e0cc5f3b.mp4  This only happens on my android device no matter the source of the sticker. On my linked desktop and the other participant in my conversation's IOS device don't face this. Everywhere the sticker is on my android device has this speed playback effect on signal.  FFmpeg command: The animated stickers were created from a webp that had the individual sticker frames and were cropped and concated together through a complex filter on a window machine. An example command: `ffmpeg -loop 1 -framerate 60 -t 0.130 -i animation.webp -loop 1 -t 0.200 -framerate 60 -i animation.webp -filter_complex ""[0:v]crop=256:256:0:0[0v];[0:v]crop=256:256:256:0[1v];[0v][1v]concat=n=2:v=1 [v]"" -map ""[v]"" -plays 0 output.apng`  Link to apngs: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ux9m2EpkqvU6xBYAqB_KNvgz6orqTOj-?usp=sharing  ### Steps to reproduce - Upload stickers in a sticker pack   - Emojis/name/author name doesn't seem to affect it. - Send emoji in conversation or have emoji sent to you   - Source doesn't matter, it could be from a linked desktop app or another's phone - Observe animated sticker is playing really fast (like fast forwarded) - Can also add sticker pack and see fast playback in the sticker selection screen  **Actual result:** Animated stickers has Nx playback where N > 1 (speedup playback) **Expected result:** Animated sticker plays at 1x speed (normal speed)  ### Screenshots https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1360989/130343368-404fb303-ddc8-4d7b-bd7d-6c65e0cc5f3b.mp4  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 4 XL **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.21.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/49e228331f02ade703174bf1d58d2636e6071de1fda7c4826d160eb710bbb41c","closed","wontfix,","parrajustin","2021-08-22T05:47:55Z","2022-02-02T05:09:42Z"

However I cannot re-link to desktop or ipad after unlinking from phone. QR preview is visible but scanning appears to do nothing, does not recognise signal QR or other random QR.  Initially thought this was a signal QR reader problem just with desktop as ipad initially linked straight away but after unlinking, it will also not re-connect.

When Signal on my desktops next synced, ALL of my contacts now use the new contact's picture. A re-sync of the contacts doesn't fix. Neither does removing contact permissions in Android settings. I also attempted a reinstall and whatever cache was left on my computer still referenced the same picture.  This issue was submitted on the [Desktop issue tracker ](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/5813)and doesn't appear to be a Desktop bug.  ### Steps to Reproduce    1.  Add new contact on Android. 2.  Add picture to contact. 3.  Sync contacts on Desktop.   **Actual result:** All contacts have the new contact's picture **Expected result:** Contacts should retain their contact picture.  ### Screenshots  ![157092848-0550814c-6f8f-47d2-af5d-858fbc95730b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101134661/161345643-c6c6a87a-0b20-4cd1-ac70-1c5c0a9c09a1.png) ![157092854-9c3e3f1b-dff7-42ca-a8dc-264207251814](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101134661/161345647-08e547ed-d14a-4daa-9b37-5bc28098c64d.png)    ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** Android 12 Build SP2A.220305.012 **Signal version:** 5.34.5  ### Link to debug log Windows: https://debuglogs.org/desktop/5.34.0/3423368badfd2982544f12b2379fcf99a98e591d02b926c39cc0b6a6d8cf15ce.gz  Android: https://debuglogs.org/android/5.32.15/06b46ef7c7661d221f84b399fb2682c49f1467971d4ef7b49fda36d6d2443197","open","acknowledged,","jrlebbs","2022-04-01T21:48:09Z","2022-04-08T17:25:06Z"

I'd flashed my phone, and I'm a regular Signal user. Signal, now is not on my phone. My brother sent me a message, I didn't know. After setting up my phone, I opened Signal to see any messages if exist, none of them were there even though I haven't deleted my account. Where did the message that brother sent go?   I'm unaware if it's a server error or anything else. But this thing really pisses me out. I lost a precious one-time opportunity because of that.     If the recipient's device is unavailable, then it should wait for atleast 24 hours to have that device active so that the recipient can read the message.  ### Steps to reproduce - Uninstall Signal - Ask someone to send you a message.(now, you're unaware that a message has arrived) - Install signal, you'll not see the message that the guy on the other side sent you.  **Actual result:** I cannot see any hints or messages that someone had sent me a message as Signal was not installed. **Expected result:** Even if Signal is not installed on the device, the user is registered, means, if a person/sender sends a message to receiver/me, the moment I install Signal, I should know atleast know that the specific sender had sent me a message so that I can acknowledge.    If nothing is notified how could a person know?   ### Screenshots  This doesn't require screenshots in my opinion.   ### Device info  This bug can be seen on every device, not only mine.   **Device:** Nokia 6.1 Plus(LineageOS) **Android version:** 11.0(18.1) **Signal version:** 5.14.0  ### Link to debug log  This has nothing to do with logs.","closed","wontfix,","pixincreate","2021-06-08T04:14:48Z","2022-02-02T08:58:57Z"

However if you use the more options button on the conversation list, and then press create new profile, you skip the introduction screen. This can't be the intended behavior.  In fact I would go a step further and say that even if you already have one or more notification profiles made but have had it disabled for a month or longer, you should also see the introduction screen again as odds are that you forgot what this feature does.  Notification profiles are not a common feature in messaging apps, therefore being prompted with an explanation is important. Users are more likely to discover this freature through the conversationlist drop down options than they are to discover it through app settings.  A final detail: the menu item in the cinveration list is called ""Notification profile"" but without any verb this should be an infinitive: ""Notification profiles"" with the letter s at the end.  ### Device info  **Device:** Manufacturer Model XVI **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.34.8  ### Link to debug log","open","acknowledged,","Meteor0id","2022-04-02T13:36:18Z","2022-06-06T12:05:32Z"

The latter condition is important to specify, as the back camera auto-flash mode is available if the app turns on the front camera first AND THEN flips to back camera.  ### Precondition  Make sure Signal turns on back camera by default:  - Open Signal - Tap on the camera icon at the bottom right - If the front camera turned on, tap on ""flip side"" icon; otherwise, skip this step - Close Signal  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Tap on the camera icon at the bottom right - Tap the flash icon up top twice - Tap on the ""flip side"" icon up top twice - Tap the flash icon twice  **Actual result:**  Auto-flash is not available when turning the back camera on right away, have to flip to front camera and then back to back camera for this option to exist.  **Expected result:**  Auto-flash is available for the back camera at all times.  ### Screenshots   https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68671029/124839884-4a7c4280-df4f-11eb-80b8-2a931eaf8db3.mp4      ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/12029ef70ef725bd19beac022fe142284510926813350965643b5f3cbc3ac9d0","closed","wontfix,","Timbobeek","2021-07-07T23:18:06Z","2022-02-02T09:59:27Z"

You have the option to send or delete your partially recorded message  **Expected result:** The memo should continue to record, since it is locked, until the user decides they are done recording   ### Device info **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.25.7","open","acknowledged,","bitmold","2021-11-06T16:26:46Z","2022-05-30T16:31:42Z"

When re-entering the chat window the message looks sent and all is fine. More specifically, the SMS was 4 concat SMS long with no emoji. So lots of text. Could this happen also when sending long text messages to contacts to who I wrote already, so not a new chat? I don't know and it's hard to test as I can't spam people.  ### Steps to reproduce * Go in the view to write an SMS to a contact you never wrote before  * Write a long SMS (4 message in my case) * Send the message  **Actual result:** The sending animation keeps looping until exiting the chat **Expected result:** The sending animation should be run just once and the message should appear in the chat as sent.  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus 7T **Android version:** 11.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.30.6  ### Link to debug log  [https://debuglogs.org/android/5.30.6/b2ea662ea30a8617a0cf26b83f42be2cd06ee2103f4842236feabe93dade13a7](https://debuglogs.org/android/5.30.6/b2ea662ea30a8617a0cf26b83f42be2cd06ee2103f4842236feabe93dade13a7)","open","","LaPeste","2022-02-10T09:30:37Z","2022-06-20T09:42:51Z"

Opening bubble for second time after hiding it will show transparent bubble window which enables interactions with whatever that is underneath. Also there are two Signal instances shown in ""Recent Apps"" menu. One for ""normal"" Signal (eg being on conversation list, or settings, or anywhere else in the app) and second one when tapped leads into transparent bubble + conversation for that bubble.  Bubbles are being shown correctly for other app (tested with sample [People app](https://github.com/android/user-interface-samples/tree/main/People) which showcases Bubbles)  Note: bug occurs since my phone updated to Android 12 (OneUI 4.0). On Android 11 bubbles conversation was shown properly.  ### Steps to reproduce Situation 1 - have a contact with bubble notifications enabled - receive new message - open bubble notification with new message  **Actual result:** Transparent bubble window is opened AND normal signal conversation is shown in background. Transparent bubble content cannot be interacted with - all touch gestures go to whatever is beneath. **Expected result:** Signal conversation is shown ONLY as bubble, that is contained to bubble notification screen limits.  Situation 2 - go back to home screen - open bubble notification again  **Actual result:** Transparent bubble window is opened. Transparent bubble content cannot be interacted with - all touch gestures go to whatever is beneath (eg you can switch home screens if home screen is beneath bubble) **Expected result:** Signal conversation is shown within bubble.  ### Screenshots  Screenshot showing situation 1 ![signal-2022-02-03-232223_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34172516/152440797-a8b35dcc-b602-496a-afa3-3e0f4b12ffcb.jpeg) Screenshot showing situation 2 ![signal-2022-02-03-232223_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34172516/152440838-4029c3b3-2113-40f6-bdc2-87dfc5f15513.jpeg)  Screenshot showing recent apps with two signal instances: one leads to conversation list (because that's where I left Signal) and can be seen on the right, one in the center which looks blank leads to Situation 1 ![signal-2022-02-03-232223_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34172516/152440855-7ac3339a-dd15-4c67-98d1-2559f6925cdc.jpeg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S21 5G **Android version:** Android 12, One UI 4.0 **Signal version:** 5.29.7  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/dc7b0e6bee42e60c3b55ced9b5e168722b85b944e8a2f8119b853d20f1069693","open","acknowledged,","improved-spoon","2022-02-03T22:45:29Z","2022-04-11T16:42:17Z"

I've checked my Internet speed, and it shows 10 Mbps, so it's clearly not a network issue.  ### Steps to reproduce - Share an image or link or any video to a contact and the circle keeps on rotating - To sent that message, I had to restart the whole device or clear the storage of signal from settings and login again  **Actual result:** The circle keeps on rotating and the file would never have sent unless I restart my phone again **Expected result:** The circle rotates for few seconds, and it would show the check mark  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola G40 Fusion **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:**  5.31.6  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/android/5.31.6/dc25a6ada924b2e9ac4f02aaf050b06d0aa4c7d385abd71f59fa92cd2e9a1bb2","closed","wontfix,","NoobieOnGitHub","2022-02-16T03:54:47Z","2022-04-27T04:58:45Z"

Test issue was with the following file: [send.txt](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/7071142/send.txt)  The send file has 531B, the received one has 541B and looks like this: [received.txt](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/7071141/received.txt)  The content is equal except for a second line with some chunk from the end of the original file and no newline at the end.  It also occurred with sender/receiver switched.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send file `send.txt` to another user and noting its size - Check file on receiving device and see that file size and content differ  **Actual result:** The file I send is not the file others receive. **Expected result:** The files should (obviously) be the same.  ### Screenshots  File name was changed to upload it to github.  #### Sender: ![sender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55398943/131226417-af88dcd3-2192-4b7f-841b-4e7feb328d7d.png)  #### Receiver: ![receiver](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55398943/131226409-525547ef-cf5d-4065-a14f-2ed5560dc3f1.png)   ### Device info  #### Sender: **Device:** OnePlus One **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.21.6  #### Receiver: **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.21.6  ### Link to debug log  Not Immediately after occurrence but maybe it is sufficient: https://debuglogs.org/991ef852ac763bb50e1d87e3c82f9eea95ae75868f82a9168f601ebf07a19ea6  Please let me know if you need more details.

For example, where it once would've shown me johndoe@gmail.com, it is now showing johndoe@gma. Additionally, I have a contact that always sends using the email to text MMS gateway through my carrier, and when I try to create a contact for this email address to give it a friendly name, Signal does not correctly identify the sender as a valid contact.   I have tried adding the email to an existing contact, and creating a contact with only the email address. Signal does have contact permission on my device.  It is worth noting that in my testing, it does not appear that SMS messages exhibit this behavior, only MMS (Verizon can deliver an email as an SMS using @vtext.com, or MMS using @vzwpix.com) I also set my default SMS/MMS app back to the stock Android app and verified that these messages were indeed processed correctly at the carrier end, and the stock Messages app received them without truncating the email.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive MMS message on Signal that was sent by using carrier's email to text service (when Signal is the default MMS/SMS app) - Notification displays correctly without truncating the address of the sender. - Viewing message in Signal shows truncated sender name based on length of email address (i.e. john@gmail.com may not truncate at all, while johntomharry@gmail.com will truncate more of the address).      **Actual result: MMS messages sent to a phone using Signal as its default MMS/SMS app using email-to-text gateway have truncated email addresses shown as the sender in the message and message view, but display correctly in notification. **Expected result:  Email address should not be truncated and display correctly.  ### Screenshots Please let me know if you need screenshots provided. I will have to take some and edit out some of the details to hide part of the email.   ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 4A **Android version:** 12.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.32.14 (happened on 5.32.7 as well)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.32.14/afa0d514040d8980810ddfea7058a4b634efd7977e04ff0205a6b77867b14d88","open","sms,","w1bsb","2022-02-26T21:41:22Z","2022-07-04T14:54:24Z"

When I wake up device and going into Signal app I can see that the time and progress bar of the voice message is still going, but without sound what is not good when we talk about voice messaging. To fix it I must close the app, open it again and start playing the voice message from the point where it stops and in best case not let a phone to go to the sleep state as the sound would stop again after a minute.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive a voice message 3+min to test it - Set the screen on time to 30sec - Listen to the voice message - Let the screen go off - After a minute or so of screen of time the sound suddenly stops. - Wake up device - Go to Signal - See that the voice message is still playing without sound  **Actual result: Sound of the voice message stops playing after the screen is off for minute or more.

The reason I hit this (and why it is a dangerous bug) is because I was trying to use the text feature with emoji to redact a face from a photo, and it was very surprising to have it proceed to send the unredacted photo. Thankfully this was only embarrassing rather than dangerous.   ### Steps to reproduce - In a conversation, click + and select a photo - Click the pen icon, then the ""Aa"" text tool icon - Enter an emoji - Close the keyboard then use the handles to make the emoji large - Accept the edit with the check box - Save the image with the ""download"" looking icon  This will have saved an image without the emoji in it.

Sometimes, depending on how fast the user swiped it can be reproducible, but often it does not finish archiving the chat.   **Actual result:** Sometimes the chat gets archived **Expected result:** When a user switches the app, chats should never be archived.

Signal Desktop behaves correctly here. I suspect this problem was introduced in 3f7dd2118654516aea26cd87e095a4ad87d2a606, which I believe is preventing the URL from being treated as a link at all, rather than the intended effect of preventing link previews. Since onion addresses (especially now that only the v3 format is supported) are intended to be used as non-human readable identifiers, similar to e.g. IPv6 addresses, that are conveyed via links rather than typing in the domain, this winds up being a pretty annoying behavior to work around.  ### Steps to reproduce - send or receive a message with a .onion URL in it (e.g., https://dns4torpnlfs2ifuz2s2yf3fc7rdmsbhm6rw75euj35pac6ap25zgqad.onion/) - attempt to tap on URL to open (presumably in Tor Browser, though others exist as well)  **Actual result:** URL is displayed and treated as unformatted text **Expected result:** URL functions as a hyperlink, similar to other URLs, albeit without preview functionality  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) **Android version:** 10 (LineageOS 17.1) **Signal version:** 5.15.6","closed","wontfix,","jtracey","2021-07-11T02:29:48Z","2022-02-05T00:29:34Z"

The issue came up in #6642 and was intended to be fixed in #6837. Unclear if this is regression at an unknown time after v4.10.0 or if this a device / android version specific issue.  A similar issue has been raised for audio clips in #8462 and #7954. In PR #9508 the solution was using the power wake lock api.  ### Steps to reproduce - receive video message longer than screen timeout (~30 seconds default on my device) that was recorded via built-in camera functionality - play video without touch interaction  **Actual result:** Screen decreases in brightness (after about ~25 seconds) before eventually going to sleep (after ~30 seconds). This stops the audio/video playback. When unlocking the screen the video returns to beginning and user must manually seek to find previous point. **Expected result:** Able to watch video without interaction by keeping screen awake.  As an extension feature, it might be even more preferable to play using default media controls as mentioned in #8462 so can also watch listen to audio while viewing other apps (though this should likely be user configurable).  I believe this is the source attempting to enforce the keep-wake (but not completely sure if this is right video player) https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/2dd887cd17ab37a8814da046d8b0cb16a86abf74/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/video/VideoPlayer.java#L307-L329 [This SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52110502) suggests `playerView.setKeepScreenOn(true)` might be a solution rather than the window flags.

Normally Signal marks a recipient as UD-disabled following a non-UD send, which can be seen here:  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f5475fc94507618f1c38226e7084365eabddf4d/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/jobs/PushTextSendJob.java#L115-L117  and here: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f5475fc94507618f1c38226e7084365eabddf4d/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/jobs/PushMediaSendJob.java#L152-L154  Which leads to future sends being non-UD sends until the recipient's UD status is changed.  The problem is that a successfully sent sealed-sender message never gets labeled that way so Signal mistakenly marks the recipient UD-disabled making future sends UNsealed-sender messages.  ### Prerequisites: - Device A (Alice): - No installed Play Service. - Disable typing indicators (we don't want any accidental communication to Bob since if a TypingSendJob is run, it'll prematurely mark the recipient UD-disabled). - Allow sealed sender from everyone and show indicators for it. - Enable censorship circumvention.  - Device B (Bob): - Allow sealed sender from everyone and show indicators for it.  - Alice and Bob are system contacts to each other and have sent messages back and forth before following these steps.  ### Steps to reproduce - Alice opens up Bob's conversation (RetrieveProfileJob is run, Bob is marked as UD-UNRESTRICTED since he allows sealed-sender from everyone). - Alice types up a message (no TypingSendJob is enqueued so no premature communication to Bob) - Alice sends the message - SignalServiceMessageSender hits a WebSocketUnavailableException since WebSocket is not available (censorship circumvention is on) https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f5475fc94507618f1c38226e7084365eabddf4d/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/SignalServiceMessageSender.java#L1679-L1687 - Signal falls back to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f5475fc94507618f1c38226e7084365eabddf4d/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/SignalServiceMessageSender.java#L1698 - PushServiceSocket.sendMessage sends the message successfully https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f5475fc94507618f1c38226e7084365eabddf4d/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/internal/push/PushServiceSocket.java#L514-L521 - And the responseText variable was never null in my tests, so https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f5475fc94507618f1c38226e7084365eabddf4d/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/internal/push/PushServiceSocket.java#L521 is executed - Which doesn't mark the message UD status with unidentifiedAccess,IsPresent(), it just returns JsonUtil.fromJson - So now Signal thinks that the sent message was non-UD and marks the recipient UD-disabled, and the following sends are non-UD until you exit out of the conversation and open it again to trigger a RetrieveProfileJob and start the cycle again. - Bob receives the message, and checks the message details and finds the sealed-sender symbol. - Alice checks the message details and doesn't find the sealed-sender symbol. - Now if Alice doesn't exit out of the conversation and keep texting Bob, the messages will be unsealed-sender.  **Actual result:** Signal doesn't mark a sealed-sender message as sealed-sender. **Expected result:** Signal should mark a message sealed-sender status correctly.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** AVD **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.32.4  ### Link to debug log No need, reliably reproducible.","closed","","stevie553","2022-02-12T22:09:01Z","2022-02-20T14:55:28Z"

In other words, the very same string ""You"" is getting used when it functions as a) a grammatical subject or b) an grammatical object. While this works in English, it doesn't work in many other languages, where the translation of ""You"" would be different depending on its function and location within the sentence. I've watched this issue for years now, and translators for several languages asked about it. There's zero way to solve this on the translators' side.  My suggested solution is splitting up the current string ``MediaPreviewActivity_s_to_s`` into two separate strings:  1. MediaPreviewActivity_you_to_s: ‚ÄúYou to %1$s‚Äù (if user is sender) 2. MediaPreviewActivity_s_to_you: ‚Äú%1$s to you‚Äù (if user is recipient) 3. MediaPreviewActivity_you: ""You"" (although I think this one can get removed completely if it's not used in other places)  As an example, the German translation of these two strings would be  1. MediaPreviewActivity_you_to_s: ‚ÄúDu an %1$s‚Äù 2. MediaPreviewActivity_s_to_you: ‚Äú%1$s an dich"" 3.

Picked up phone and opened Signal 2. Phone thought it was being held sideways, even though it was vertical, so Signal opened in landscape orientation (this happens occasionally with any app, not sure why) 3. Gave phone a slight shake so it would register the correct orientation 4. Signal rotated to portrait orientation 5. Saw that the ""Verify your Signal PIN"" megaphone had appeared, so I tapped ""Verify PIN""  **Actual result:** The PIN entry dialog opened, but was sized to fit on a landscape screen and was extended beyond the right side of the screen. (See screenshot) Rotating the phone to landscape caused the dialog to fit properly, but rotating back to portrait did not cause it to resize and it remained in the landscape dimensions. **Expected result:** Dialog should open with correct dimensions and should also resize if the phone is rotated.  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20210709-010159~2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10427164/125032536-ba73f100-e053-11eb-9da3-c59b1b1340e7.png)    ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/3cbca9a06617bf2773eb6d1a7a37c622ceed8e159cc066e7c43686bb6855648e","open","acknowledged,","Herohtar","2021-07-09T06:20:37Z","2022-06-15T12:45:11Z"

This is the only proper translation, used everywhere where speaker is translated. I now see that Signal imposed a limit of 8 characters for the translation of speaker. That's 1 character more than the English word. That's unreasonable. In this case it would make sense to update the UI so it can take a few more characters, rather than imposing a limit which only hurts users in other language regions and calling the matter resolved.  Furthermore we see that we already translated these before the character limit was placed, and thus we can see that longer strings actually do fit quite well, with the exeption of the word ""luidspreker"" for which the last letter jumps to the next line. Ideally the word would be translated as ""`Luid¬≠spreker`"" allowing it to word wrap properly, however: 1. Signal does not support rendering ¬≠ on this string 2. The character limit prevents us from editing this text string to anything longer than 8 char.   Proposed solution: Leave this to translators discretion. Enable rendering of `¬≠` only on call button labels (performance impact, but only at a critical place in the app) and stop imposing a character limit. This is less ideal performance wise, but allows for proper translations that make sense to users in other languages. Forcing 8 char simply doesn't cut it here, the label might as well be removed then as only the icon would still make sense.  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20211122-212237](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/142931149-093c6cc3-aa51-4255-bae0-086e792f329c.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.27.2  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","Meteor0id","2021-11-22T20:30:40Z","2022-07-02T01:46:19Z"

Press on either the attachment button, or the emoji button, or the gif button or the sticker button (doesn‚Äôt matter which one). (The menu opens) 3. Press the back button  This time on my device I leave the chat and go back to the overview. This is not consistent with how the text keyboard gets dismissed.  Every step back should undo only 1 action. Opening the attachment menu or emoji keyboard is an action, and so it makes sense the back button only closes that keyboard rsther than closing the whole chat.  Why this matters:  - Doing this wrong caises unconcious frustration bevause muscle memory is hard to learn for this. - It‚Äôs even more frustrating because you might be used to something different from other Android apps.  The back button should always first dismiss any opened menu/keyboard and not immediatly close the whole chat.  Another user (Herohtar) tried to reproduce this on a Pixel 5 and for them the nack button dismisses the emoji keyboard and/or attachement picker without closing the conversation, so the issue appears to be device spesific.   ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.30.1  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/c1ac1d5a7b8af2deffbaa2293e5128276053771f8a37063f5555cb2cc08a218a","closed","","Meteor0id","2022-01-26T19:50:58Z","2022-02-03T14:25:36Z"

On Android 12, this results in web intents for Signal not opening directly in the app by default (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#web-intent-resolution)  ### Steps to reproduce  Following https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations#invoke-domain-verification:  ``` $ adb shell pm get-app-links org.thoughtcrime.securesms   org.thoughtcrime.securesms:     ID: 36102c4f-9655-4fa6-b098-94cfe53e61b7     Signatures: [29:F3:4E:5F:27:F2:11:B4:24:BC:5B:F9:D6:71:62:C0:EA:FB:A2:DA:35:AF:35:C1:64:16:FC:44:62:76:BA:26]     Domain verification state:       signal.group: legacy_failure       signal.art: legacy_failure       signal.tube: legacy_failure       signal.me: legacy_failure ```  From https://signal.group/.well-known/assetlinks.json, https://signal.art/.well-known/assetlinks.json, https://signal.tube/.well-known/assetlinks.json, https://signal.me/.well-known/assetlinks.json, the JSON uses `""29:F3:4E:5F:27:F2:11:B4:24:BC:5B:F9:D6:71:62:C0 EA:FB:A2:DA:35:AF:35:C1:64:16:FC:44:62:76:BA:26""` as the sha256 of the signing certificate fingerprint. However, there's a space in the fingerprint; this is likely the reason why it's failing verification.

If the code was verified, then the backup would be restored including all chat history, groups, media, and SMS messages.  According to your official documentation, **this should still be possible**.  From your support article: https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6888381/147775967-d0da4f2a-a2ae-48f0-bec7-88ab1c701a7c.png)  This no longer works as of signal 5.28.8 (and probably earlier)  ### Steps to reproduce - Backup Signal on Android device - Copy backup file to laptop - Wipe Android device - Copy backup file back to Android device - Attempt to restore backup by setting up Signal again - Notice that only group membership is restored, and safety number has changed  **Actual result:** Chats are not restored, and there is no prompt for the 30 digit backup passphrase **Expected result:** Backup should be recognized, backup passphrase should be prompted for, and chats should have been restored with all history, attachments, and SMS messages.  ### Screenshots  N/A  ### Impact I have lost 3.2GB of important chat history and documents which cannot be restored. All Signal desktop clients have been unlinked, and my contacts have observed that my safety number has changed.  There was no in-app messaging, blog posts, or announcements made about any change to the backup/restore system, so I am considering this to be a major regression.  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus 7 Pro 5G (GM1925) **Android version:** 10 (patch level: 2021-11-01) **Signal version:** 05.28.8  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/53290bcf5d6cb8c1a7acc10db85e3081280c344129f9a70ae54f24a619f0bd4f","open","acknowledged,","keeferrourke","2021-12-30T17:52:52Z","2022-04-21T12:28:46Z"

As soon as the device is connected to WiFi, messages gets routed, otherwise there's no communication in or out.  A friend even tried to uninstall and reinstall signal and it didn't let him re-register, saying ""no network"".  This happens on a range of devices with different vendors (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei) Android versions (8, 9, 10 and 11) and different data and WiFi providers. The only common thing is the location (Italy) and the app version (5.27.13).  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a message on Mobile Data  **Actual result:** Spinning icon untill connected to WiFi.

I don't know if the app had recently updated. Neither clearing its cache, nor rebooting the phone helped. Launching while offline didn't make a difference. Clearing data didn't fix it.  Uninstalled and reinstalled from the Play Store. Upon launch, the phone screen just goes mostly white (top icons and back/home/apps buttons on bottom still visible, and the rest of the screen semi-transparent), no splash screen, nothing about setting up or restoring backup.  Captured a log with `adb logcat` after the steps below while online.  The primary (at launch?) error appears to be: `E AndroidRuntime: net.zetetic.database.sqlcipher.SQLiteCantOpenDatabaseException: unknown error (code 14): Could not open database` But I also get this earlier error (at install?): `E PackageManager: Failed to create app data for org.thoughtcrime.securesms: com.android.server.pm.Installer$InstallerException: android.os.ServiceSpecificException: Failed to prepare /data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms (code 0)` Note that the phone's storage was less than half full, and I have since installed other apps without issue.  Is there anything I should do to ensure a fresh install with no potential of lingering effects from the original app crash? I'm just assuming that uninstalling the app removes anything that could impact the reinstall.  ### Steps to reproduce - uninstall Signal app - reboot phone - install Signal app from Play Store - launch Signal app  **Actual result:** Hangs with white screen before splash screen. **Expected result:** Splash screen, then prompt to setup or restore from backup.  ### Screenshots  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/845582/182537845-57912968-fad8-43e8-a451-35a8a3b09abf.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Z2 **Android version:** 9.0 **Signal version:** 5.43.7  ### Link to debug log  Can't get a log from the app because of launch hang.

Small lag is acceptable when the device doesn't have enough power, but not freezing the system  ### Screenshots Not relevant   ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Mi A1 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.18.5 (but tested on at least four previous versions, as well)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/aed623d5c8a3a54dc11307d039d9ad1dac39598ea9853bb4fcc2d8e920903d82  Logcat: 08-01 15:15:42.858   529   580 E ANDR-PERF-OPTSHANDLER: Perflock resource /proc/sys/kernel/sched_spill_nr_run not supported 08-01 15:15:42.858   529   580 E ANDR-PERF-RESOURCEQS: Failed to apply optimization [3, 11] 08-01 15:15:42.858   529   580 E ANDR-PERF-OPTSHANDLER: Perflock resource /proc/sys/kernel/sched_restrict_cluster_spill not supported 08-01 15:15:42.858   529   580 E ANDR-PERF-RESOURCEQS: Failed to apply optimization [3, 13] 08-01 15:15:42.872 18419 18419 W ActivityThread: handleWindowVisibility: no activity for token android.os.BinderProxy@a92ce5c 08-01 15:15:42.897 18419 18419 W crime.securesm: Accessing hidden field Landroid/view/View;->mAttachInfo:Landroid/view/View$AttachInfo; (greylist-max-p, reflection, denied) 08-01 15:15:42.950  2634  9693 W DevicePolicyManager: Package org.thoughtcrime.securesms (uid=10223, pid=18419) cannot access Device IDs 08-01 15:15:42.951  3570  3898 W TelephonyPermissions: reportAccessDeniedToReadIdentifiers:org.thoughtcrime.securesms:getSubscriptionInfoList:isPreinstalled=false:isPrivApp=false 08-01 15:15:43.014  2634  3647 W DevicePolicyManager: Package org.thoughtcrime.securesms (uid=10223, pid=18419) cannot access Device IDs 08-01 15:15:43.014  3570  3898 W TelephonyPermissions: reportAccessDeniedToReadIdentifiers:org.thoughtcrime.securesms:getSubscriptionInfoList:isPreinstalled=false:isPrivApp=false 08-01 15:15:43.110  2634  4162 E WindowManager: App trying to use insecure INPUT_FEATURE_NO_INPUT_CHANNEL flag.

By network change I mean, either joining or leaving a wifi network or toggling mobile data on/off. This happens naturally if I walk outside of wifi range, but seems to hang indefinitely if I don't leave the network. This started within the last week and has happened on several different wifi networks and levels of cell reception. I have not noticed connectivity issues with any other apps or with my limited sms use within signal.   I've restarted my phone several times in this time as well as ""Reset Wi-Fi, mobile, and Bluetooth"" in my system settings without it stopping.   ### Steps to reproduce This is not deterministically reproducible. It seems to impact well under 10% of my messages on a given day.    - send a message, see the icon spinning for pending to send ![Screenshot_20220320-091952](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3374110/159178783-53fe024e-35ad-49dc-bc9d-92a83b317f50.png)  - toggle wifi or network on/off   - see the message send  ![Screenshot_20220320-092058](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3374110/159178806-e6d30357-5d8c-476a-a899-64f3c5fde0e5.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** 12 with Feb 5 security update (I'm planning to update android versions right after filing this to see if it helps) **Signal version:** 5.34.0 **Network:** Google Fi  ### Link to debug log   Two sets of logs:   One time I observed this happening right after sending a message on cell which I solved by toggling cell on/off https://debuglogs.org/android/5.34.0/2440b284f2b80f83a30eb644fa7ba982ba9ac2ebe3f77cd39040234ba3a14ff8  Later I took logs when it happened on wifi and then again after switching and getting it to send on cell  Right after first attempt: https://debuglogs.org/android/5.34.0/96ad97d7a5b1ec6f6e8ec907b3111c2d5684618c202d01de3a67a4f40aa13268 Right after turning wifi off and the message sends: https://debuglogs.org/android/5.34.0/699630f40c7dad99c80b054a6f6378646687c55bce167f4fcf1e861fd1dcd3f6","closed","","benmayne","2022-03-20T19:21:34Z","2022-03-28T21:55:21Z"

A ""Paste"" menu option also appears, but nothing happens when you click on it. It's also confirmed to not be a generic limitation in Android or a local problem on my phone, since it works to paste the exact same GIF from the exact same clipboard contents into other chat apps, like e.g. Telegram.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use any method to copy a GIF image (NOT a URL, but rather, the actual image data) into the Android clipboard. One example is to use the Giphy app (standalone app, not from some keyboard or similar) and copying a GIF in that app by (single)clicking it. - Start Signal and go into a chat. - Long-click the chat text box to bring upp the context menu, which will show the ""paste"" option. - Click the ""paste"" option in the context menu. - Nothing happens, and the context menu doesn't even disappear. - For reference, now start the ""Telegram"" chat app instead, and repeat the exact same procedure for a chat in there, and it will work like a charm, posting the GIF directly into the chat. - For additional reference, perform the exact same procedure on Signal on an iPhone instead, and it will also work like a charm, posting the GIF directly into the chat.  **Actual result:** Nothing happens, and the context menu doesn't even disappear when clicking ""paste"". **Expected result:** The GIF in the clipboard should be posted into the chat, just like it is on the iPhone version of Signal.  ### Screenshots N/A  ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 5 **Android version:** Android 11 fully patched **Signal version:** Latest  ### Link to debug log N/A","closed","wontfix,","CodyMcCodeface","2021-11-07T01:35:52Z","2022-02-01T23:32:25Z"

On that discussion it was mentioned the Signal Sticker API already allows submitting stickers with multiple emoji and even keywords. The different Signal clients do not implement suggestions the same way, therefore only the Android client will actually show a match when typing such key word. However this match already shows up when the first letter of the keyword matches what the user has typed. This allows sticker pack creators to create sticker packs for which the stickers get suggested too often.  The easy decision to make would be to limit sticker suggestions to only 1 emoji, but I hope Signal will instead first research other options such as actually allowing multiple emoji's and maybe also keywords. If keywords are implemented, thee number of keywords associated with a single sticker should be limited as well as the minimum number of characters it consists of, that he clients should only suggest the sticker on a near or exact match.  This is the topic on the forums: https://community.signalusers.org/t/assign-multiple-emojis-to-a-sticker/30362/12  I am filing it as a bug here because it can be abused on Android, and there is no way to know how often it is already happening.  ### Device info  **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.30.3","closed","wontfix,","Meteor0id","2022-01-29T17:51:08Z","2022-04-07T10:28:34Z"

Signal is set as Android's default messaging app. In the Signal settings I have enabled the option to receive SMS delivery reports, yet the delivery reports are not shown in Signal. There only appears a single tick indicator that shows that the message has been sent; but the second tick that the message was received is missing. This issue appeared just recently as I switched from an old Sony phone (Android 9 or 10) to the Fairphone 4 with Android 11.   The app `Google Messages` works just fine in this regards and correctly displays the delivery reports.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal on a Fairphone 4 5G - Enable the option to receive delivery reports in ""Settings"" > ""Conversations"" > ""SMS & MMS"" > ""SMS Delivery Reports"" (actual naming might be a little bit off since I use a localized version of Signal) - Send an SMS to a contact (force that the message is sent as an SMS by a long press on the send button)   **Actual result:** No SMS delivery report is shown in Signal, i.e., only a single tick mark appears below the mssage. No indication is given when viewing the details of the message as well.  **Expected result:** Two tickmarks should be shown to indicate that the delivery report was received, as well as an entry in the message details.  ### Screenshots ![Signal Conversation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24356915/144583077-63a84271-871c-4f68-bfb1-69f841a3940e.jpeg) (No double-tick indicators are displayed as like no SMS delivery report has been received.)  ![Signal Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24356915/144583131-ae65f9f5-1c34-43f8-a4e0-4d04b1ce8e31.jpeg) (Details view of such an SMS message.)  ![Signal Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24356915/144583160-cb425f2e-04b3-4b11-bc68-a1ca2b227eaa.jpeg) (Settings view)  ![Google Messages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24356915/144583229-47fda488-c311-414d-8938-149eb394cd1d.jpeg) (Google Messages works just fine.)   ### Device info Fairphone 4.

This behavior has been introduced in the latest stable release (5.18.5) - everything worked fine in the previous version from release channel.

It only happens with Signal's own emoji set.  ### Steps to reproduce - Remove Signal from recents screen - Open Signal app  **Actual result:** In conversation list, emojis being part of conversation previews are not visible (there's blank space instead). User has to switch to different activity and then go back to conversation list screen to make emojis visible. **Expected result:** Emojis should be visible in conversation list right away.  ### Screenshots Actual behavior: ![signal-bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32198274/127744273-b0b76ad3-320f-4bce-aa09-54e2164f470b.png)  Expected behavior: ![signal-good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32198274/127744276-53dcbaca-ffa6-4787-bcdf-0b581aa3bc50.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Nokia 6.1 **Android version:** stock Android 10.0 **Signal version:** Signal 5.18.5  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/487da09e29d989d5019df0700d90e87568615ed04c9d05883b815e5247172a57","closed","","pkorba","2021-07-31T15:27:23Z","2021-08-06T12:26:31Z"

In this case, the recipient phone numbers are separated by semicolons ([one source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23466981/1933135) amongst others). Both the legacy SMS app and the ""Message"" app by Google support this. Signal does not, and will try to send to a single invalid recipient (the long string containing semicolons).  ### Steps to reproduce - Connect your phone to a computer with adb installed - Run this to simulate the intent: `adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.SENDTO -d 'smsto:+33600000001%3b+33600000002'` Note: I'm not sure of why `%3b` needs to replace `;`.  **Actual result:** If the default SMS application is Signal, redaction of a text message will start with a single invalid recipient (+33600000001+33600000002). **Expected result:** If the default SMS application is Messages by Google, redaction of a text message will start with two recipients (+33600000001 and +33600000002).  ### Device info **Device:** Mi A2 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.15.1","closed","wontfix,","Caerbannog","2021-06-25T13:59:00Z","2022-04-06T01:41:47Z"

I'm using the app on a Samsung Fold Z3 while folded, and the main screen is a bit tighter than most phones. So it seems like the input placeholder is trying to wrap to a new line due to line length overflowing the screen.  ### Steps to reproduce - type a message in a normal chat window - hit send - watch the input placeholder text  **Actual result:** The text input jitters and resizes, sometimes multiple times, as the placeholder text is reentered in the input. **Expected result:** The input placeholder should reenter, but the text input should never have to resize to accommodate that placeholder text. It should remain the same initial height with the placeholder overflowing with ellipsis.  ### Screenshots https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9964605/176235015-75eb6aa2-590c-48ef-888a-723774cc2a33.mp4   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Fold Z3 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.41.10  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.41.10/a8dc44cf7cf17ece20b24bf37511dd31c48a940dbabcc59acd55b3328b721ba7","open","","GriceTurrble","2022-06-28T16:42:20Z","2022-07-02T13:54:16Z"

When I long press and send an SMS, SMS continues until the contact messages the group, flipping the direct conversation over to Signal protocol. This has unintended consequences when the contact sends an SMS and the reply is sent over Signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start an SMS conversation with a Signal user - Start a group with that user - Have the user send a message to the group  **Actual result:** Direct SMS messaging with the signal user in a group causes the conversation to switch to Signal (SMS is not sticky) **Expected result:** A user sending an SMS while being a Signal user should be able to stick to SMS even when a message is sent over a shared Signal group.   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 8 **Android version:** Oxygen OS 11.0.8.8.IN21AA **Signal version:** 5.23.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/9b2dad32da9b12f8ee4b41c59db2a06a6fb72c6c7cb0a2b3b8e91155bc87fc33","closed","","gondoi","2021-09-09T21:33:34Z","2022-02-17T16:02:09Z"

The string was updated to mention the new amount, but on doing so the date was removed. The variable is still there but not being used anymore. The old string also still exists in srings.xml.  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/d11e8ec04b0b0a66649775e0eb84ce6e51abbb00/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/settings/app/subscription/subscribe/SubscribeFragment.kt#L226  In my opinion mentioning the date is useful, the string could be rewritten to include both variables. Exactly matching the text as seen on iOS is mot the most important here, it's just a confirmation popup.  This might just be an example of old code which hasn't been cleaned up yet.

If you send a message while signal is syncing (fetching the messages), the message being sent gets displayed in between (older) messages that are being fetched at that moment.  I am pretty sure that this can easily be fixed by delaying the rendering of the message being sent until all the fetched messages have finished rendering first. The message being sent can be sent immediately, but it has to be RENDERED after the messages that have been fetched.  ### Steps to reproduce - have a (long) conversation on signal-desktop without opening the android app - open the android app - go to the chat where a lot of messages are being fetched - send a message  **Actual result:** The message being sent gets rendered in between messages that are being fetched **Expected result:** The message being sent should only be rendered after the fetched messages have finished rendering.","closed","wontfix,","emergenz","2021-12-04T17:59:17Z","2022-02-09T20:43:17Z"

Tap the main part of the notification to access the app in context with the conversation with your friend.  **Actual result:**  Input box for message is empty. Notification is cleared so it is no longer possible to access what you had typed in there either.  **Expected result:**  Input box for message contains what you had typed in step 3 above. Notification is not cleared as it contains unsaved/unsent data.  **Additional issue**  It does not seem possible to insert newlines with the 'quick reply' feature from the notification, as the newline key on the virtual keyboard has been replaced with the airoplane send button.

After a while, Signal crashes. As soon as it's relaunched, as soon as I enter that group's conversation, Signal crashes. I use Signal for many groups so something must have gone wrong with this one group that is resulting in this crash loop. To stop the application from crashing I had a friend of mine kick me out of the group. Signal was still crashing as soon as I entered the conversation. The crashes only stopped once I deleted the conversation. Then my friend re-added me to the group, and I see that I still can't send messages, I just get a spinning wheel. My friend sent a message to the group. I received it, but when I now try to open the conversation to read it, the app crashes.  From a linked device (iPad) Signal tells me that my text message was sent to all recipients 22 times before I was removed from the group, but not delivered a single time.  After I was re-added to the group, Signal on the iPad is telling me I sent the message another 17 times, but it was not delivered to anyone successfully. None of these duplicate messages have indeed been received by anyone else.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use a group you've used for a while. Something goes wrong and my Signal app all of a sudden can't send messages to the group. The message just displays the spinning wheel. - Go back to the conversation list, leaving the draft message still trying to be sent. - Re-enter the problematic group - The app instantly crashes. - On re-launch, re-enter the problematic group.  **Actual result:** Crash loop that renders the group no longer usable by me. No idea why it's crashing. **Expected result:** I would expect no crashes, and to be told by the app why it can't send the message.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.23.8  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/777b398811b25f6dca1b0b081996c5e51c4062ee590d07ec4da1dd85e5d143b6 Also, here is another debug log after I restarted my phone, I was re-added to the group and I realised that I again can't send a message to the group: https://debuglogs.org/7a46c96b2d7dfa865ff9889d23bf15b51c114aff5dc498afedc7f4108248bca6","closed","wontfix,","i7u","2021-09-26T20:19:54Z","2022-02-02T01:05:24Z"

This resulted in the preview image being send as a MMS. The ""bug"" is more likely an ""unintended behavior"" of the app, maybe an UI/X bug. Therefore my device info and log shouldn't matter.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Navigate to a Signal chat 2. Select a message with a link which has a preview image (to be clear: I'm not talking about an image which has a link in the description. Instead I mean a link, which generated a preview image automatically. When tapping the link preview image it follows the link (contrary to a picture which would be displayed in full screen mode) 3. Tap the forward icon 4. Select any contact from the menu which has the ""SMS"" label 5. Send the message  **Actual result:** Signal sends an expensive MMS (you can check this by selecting the message, tap the (i) and it will say MMS) **Expected result:** There are some options (in order of my personal preference, first=best): 1. Signal could remove the preview image and only send the text 2. Signal could warn or inform the user that it will send an MMS in some way:    - it could say ""MMS"" instead of ""SMS"" when selecting a contact (in step 4 of the reproduction steps)    - before sending it could display a pop-up asking if the user wants to send plain text as SMS or include the preview as MMS  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 3+ **Android version:** Android 10 (/e/ OS 0.21-q-20220122158537-stable-FP3, LineageOS API-Level llama (9)) **Signal version:** 5.28.5 installed via Apps (foundation.e.apps, the default store on /e/ OS) **Relevant Settings:** generate link preview, no SMS delivery report, no WLAN call compatibility, Signal is the default SMS-App (German phone, therefore I translated the settings from German to English)","closed","","Carltoffel","2022-02-13T15:24:42Z","2022-04-29T09:50:34Z"

Now I wanted to transfer data to the device I am currently using. For that, I updated the Signal app on the old device (that I didn't use for about a year). I checked the app before the update and it worked (just some message about a new version and need for re-verification or something like that). After the update, a white screen is displayed when launching the app. The Android notification icons are still displayed. Sometimes, the screen is also black. Also, sometimes (for example when pressing ""launch"" on the Google Play Store App page recently), the whole screen turns black, so no more Android icons on the top.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have an old version of Signal running - Update it - Try to launch it  **Actual result:** See description **Expected result:** App should launch normally  ### Screenshots Can be added if considered helpful   ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** most current in Google Play Store  ### Link to debug log Cannot be created, as I cannot access the app. I am willing to provide ADB logs, if this issue can be solved.

I suspect the real issue is that the saturation picker doesn't let me reach 100% saturation. I don't know of a tool to analize these colors on my screen, but I encourage you to analize the color of the hue picker and the saturation picker in the included screenshot.  The satuafion picker should allow to choos 100% so my cyan will actually look like cyan.  ### Steps to reproduce - using hyphens as bullet points - list the steps - that reproduce the bug  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20210606-111922](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/120919377-8e162f00-c6b9-11eb-84f8-372f9c94715c.png)    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.14.0  ### Link to debug log","closed","","Meteor0id","2021-06-06T09:28:53Z","2021-06-06T13:40:51Z"

I've run into a regular issue in which if I change rooms, typically to a room with slightly worse wireless signal, the call will often flash to a ""Network Failed"" screen, which is just my video in full-screen and a ""Network Failed"" button. This is fixed simply by ending the call and recalling. Notably, audio never cuts out, and my video is still transmitted to her.  In our last call, the bug happened multiple times across multiple calls, which was a little frustrating. Oddly enough, when I ended the call, it this time briefly flashed from the full screen of my face with an error message described above to her video -- not a still from when I lost connection, but a frame or two of our current call before shutting off. My phone has been sluggish since it got some water damage which is what I think allowed me to notice this.  This suggests to me that the ""Network Failed"" page has no way of reconnecting to a video stream, and is sort of a dead-end so to speak. It seems that there was a video connection happening behind a facade error screen.  A button to attempt to reestablish connection, or simply a process to automatically do so would be appropriate here, I think.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung SM-J737T **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.32.15  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.32.15/58c2668c4e1f75c54934c17c6d0c795db9946e7e6f11f13ccd582788e5e7353a","open","wontfix,","givensuman","2022-04-09T23:04:09Z","2022-07-31T20:45:48Z"

I've done this many times in the past (I'd estimate about 8 times) and it's so unreliable that I think Signal should simply not offer to send audio messages to non-Signal users.

This was the beginning of my chat history with this person. I sent ~20 msg between noon and 4:30pm, including a 15-minute m4a audio file (recorded in Google Recorder). At ~4:30pm, I noticed that the **messages sent from noon to 1:30pm, including the recording, were no longer visible to me**. (see screenshot) They continued to be visible to my conversation partner, though they could not play the embedded audio file on their ios device. Over the course of the next 10 minutes, **1-2 more messages disappeared** on my end. (A first log was taken, link below)  This was during a sensitive discussion, and the missing messages were quite alarming. This also confused communication as I was trying to determine what I had sent already.  It does not escape my notice that, had I used Signal to record the audio message, I wouldn't have been able to easily download nor forward the audio file to anyone else.  When I checked again today at noon, **all the messages appeared back in my history**. (Screenshots below. A second log was taken as soon as I noticed this.)  Aside: The first 15-minute m4a audio file that I was trying to send to this person (recorded in Google Recorder) was not playable by the recipient. (This may have been an issue with file format, as it's downloaded in m4a from the remote Google Recorder link, but is sent as mp3 by Signal.) The link to the hosted m4a file worked fine on iOS.  ### Steps to reproduce - no idea :(  **Actual result:** Messages from first of chat onward progressively disappeared over a few hours. **Expected result:** Would not expect messages to disappear  ### Screenshots   | Before: top | After: aligned | After: top | |--------|------|------| | ![WhatsApp Image 2022-03-14 at 2 00 35 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/305339/158115246-8188ae8f-2631-41af-b2c0-c81d4b37fcc1.jpeg) | ![WhatsApp Image 2022-03-14 at 2 00 35 AM (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/305339/158115345-6bc528c5-6274-4db1-a263-50f0cc5eedeb.jpeg) | ![WhatsApp Image 2022-03-14 at 2 00 34 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/305339/158115085-a3416cb5-c687-46cc-accc-9adfc1e5b18a.jpeg) | |  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.33.1  ### Link to debug log  - Logs when messages were gone: https://debuglogs.org/android/5.33.1/923a2246803953f5b690fbe1a533a8f7997b930a96802850e01dee865798c362 - Logs the next day when messages were back: https://debuglogs.org/android/5.33.1/3e89eeb75acae2e429a0fa7c1f56576e7e761b184ba82bbbdae67a62662b1892","closed","","patcon","2022-03-14T06:43:08Z","2022-03-22T17:03:33Z"

And I haven't tried ""Reset your Google Account."" or completely uninstalling and reinstalling Signal (since I want to maintain my conversation history).  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/12068 caught my eye, but I don't think it covers what's happening for me.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have a friend send a Signal message to me - Notice that there is no Signal notification, yet there is an unread message in the Signal conversation when I open the Signal app  **Actual result:** I never see Signal notifications. I need to proactively enter the Signal app to check for messages. **Expected result:** Signal should show notifications (assuming I leave the setting enabled), like it used to.   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.34.10  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/android/5.34.10/ae003e8fdbabdbb5748b6b94e9da6dbeb2c4e4b4d625b547aabc08445d47fad3","open","","ryancwalsh","2022-04-09T21:45:40Z","2022-07-03T09:52:32Z"

User B sends a message and everyone including me sees it, so it's fine. A few days later User B sends another message that all members except me receive. I can receive all messages of other members. User B can see my messages. Since then, I do not receive messages of User B in the group anymore.  When I send a PM to User B, they receive it, BUT if he answers, another chat with the same phone mumber is opened. The chat, in which I've sent him a message, has the ""Member of Group X"" line. The chat, in which he responds, is missing that line. Both chats have the same phone and security number.  If I try to mention him in the group chat with ""@"", all members except User B are shown.   ### Steps to reproduce - User B sends a message in the group chat that everyone can see - Open group chat  **Actual result:** The message of User B is missing, only for me. **Expected result:** The message of User B is shown.  ### Screenshots ![group mention missing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13781376/140617780-57823c92-ea04-478a-8f55-7754a9d4e11c.jpg) Six group members, if I enter ""@"", User B is missing.  ![PM same number not in group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13781376/140617783-59787cf3-3cc6-41e2-b5c6-656d0640fc76.jpg) I write User B a PM.

When I try to send a video either recorded or saved locally from phone (could be a video I have saved in a chat for e.g.) it will sometimes not work. The little loading circle icon will just loop and loop until it reaches a full circle then starts over again. I can wait for minutes or hours, it will not sent successfully. So I have to longpress => delete for everyone to clear the pending transfer. Its been like this since day one on my Google Pixel 6 fresh phone and install out of the box. Is this something about the Google Pixel 6 phone and Google Android OS thats the issue?  ### Steps to reproduce - Have a Google Pixel 6 - Attach a video or record a video via camera - ""Hopefully"" it will loop and get stuck. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. It could be on wifi or 4G, with or without VPN.  **Actual result:** Will loop and loop. Transfer will be pending until you cancel it. It will never be sent. Instead I transfer the video on whatsapp but I do not want to use whatsapp really. **Expected result:** Video being sent.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 6 **Android version:** 12.

Old messages (presumably delayed by network etc) appear at end of chat (might be OK), but this incorrectly orders the chats in the main/home view (where multiple chats are shown).  For example (as per logs etc): In (Group) Chat A, a discussion is going on until 12:00 In Chat B, the last correspondence was at 11:00 In Chat A, an old message from 09:00 suddenly comes through from one member and appears at the bottom, but with an accurate 09:00 timestamp Now, in the chats overview, the ""last message time"" for Chat A says 09:00 and it does not appear at the top, despite having more recent messages than Chat B.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have chat (seen in group, not sure if it applies to any) - Have a message delayed by someone on the group (bad network?) - Note that the chat is now sorted as if the most recent message was at the time the delayed message was sent, rather than by the most recent activity  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20210728-140128__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51478811/127326656-a768857a-5237-4697-8eaa-a5bd2959bf6e.jpg)  Note: screenshot does not show sorting error in main view, which is the bug, because I was too slow. It does show the delayed message appearing underneath the more recent ones. Issue is that the chat was sorted in the main view as if the most recent message was 09:08, until a genuine new message was sent   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus Three **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.17.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/fecbc9ee87bcdd529d0ff02b1a95bb7859cc6f8d3334a2882d956640ff296c54  Note that in this debug log, one newer message came through that unset the error state before I grabbed the log.","closed","wontfix,","peter1rhodes","2021-07-28T13:09:53Z","2022-02-02T06:09:49Z"

Started being unable to send a Signal message to a single, specific user in the Signal app.  Oddly, ***and likely very important to finding out the underlying issue***, I was able to send a message to this Signal user if I tapped ""Reply"" on the system notification that appeared when they messaged me. A small overlay would appear where I could type and send a message to them, but when opening the full app, clicking on my conversation with this single user presented me with ""ENABLE SIGNAL FOR SMS"" instead of a reply box.  ### Steps to reproduce  No clue, sorry  **Actual result:** Unable to send a Signal message to a Signal user within the Signal app  **Expected result:** Should be able to send a Signal message to a Signal user without enabling SMS  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 4a **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.30.5  ### Link to debug log   https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2f554c3c1695534c7ba17ae76c3ad973  This isn't my debug log as I did not attempt a bug report at the exact time it happened to me. This is from https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6079  ### Additional Information  I just wanted to be able to message my contact and get it working again so I wiped/reset my phone after making backups and reinstalled Signal and it worked as normal. I tried reinstalling the Signal app, but the problem persisted. I had my contact reinstall the Signal app, but it persisted. Only upon wiping my phone were we able to message as normal.  Sorry. This bug was very frustrating and time consuming to deal with so when I saw that the issue had been auto closed I wanted to make sure that the devs are aware that this issue is still present.

Tap it.  - Now I am looking at my conversation ""with"" my own aux number  - Hold down the `+` button to bring up the delivery options  - Select my own *main* SIM.  Now I am writing an SMS to be sent via my main SIM, to the number for aux SIM.  - Enter some text and hit send.  **Actual result:** The message appears as outgoing in my conversation ""with"" my aux number.  But nothing else happens.  In particular, in my conversation ""with"" my own main number (which Signal titles ""Note to self"") the message is not visible.  I haven't been able to verify, but I don't think any SMS was actually sent.  **Expected result:** I should get a notification about an incoming message.  The message should appear in Signal in my ""Note to self"", and show as having arrived via my aux SIM.  The SMS flow in the other direction operates normally: if I go to ""Note to Sefl"", use the message type selector to select sending SMS using my aux SIM, and send a message, the message generates a notifcation and is delivered and displayed as expected (in my conversation ""with"" my aux number).  I think something is suppressing messages in ""Note to self"".  I think this is probably appropriate for Signal messages.  But I don't think it is appropriate for SMS.  Certainly it is not appropriate for an SMS received via a *different* SIM[1].  In particular, in a dual SIM phone, one wants to able to test a SIM by sending and receiving messages.  The behaviour of Signal confused me enough that I thought one of my telcos was at fault.  ### Additional information  [1] IME Android does not seem able to reliably establish the phone numbers for each SIM.  For example, my device's ""about phone"" gives wrong information for the phone number associated with my main SIM, and doesn't even pretend to know the phone number associated with my aux SIM.  In my case the ""main"" SIM is an eSIM.  I recently had my main number ported to that SIM.  My aux SIM is a physical SIM whose setup I haven't changed in some time.  With the help of friend at the same telco as my aux sim, I was able to establish that my aux sim's telco *can* exchange SMSs with my main sim in both directions.  Additionally I have verified, by putting my aux SIM in another device, that the two SIMs are able to exchange SMS as expected.  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 4 (Murena, e-OS as shipped) **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.38.5  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/android/5.38.5/60198a5fe7b60c98ebdcb9cd79bfac52eb39c27bf9b489131ebbc93730796fb0","open","acknowledged,","ijackson","2022-05-25T11:18:22Z","2022-07-25T14:22:53Z"

If the correct pin is entered the reminder will close on it's own. If the Signal app is forced closed the pin reminder will be closed. If someone presses the screen anywhere other vthan the input field or keyboard the keyboard will close. However if someone doesn't remember the PIN and doesn't know they can force close the Signal app or close the keyboard, than they could get stuck on this screen because the buttons are out of reach.  The buttons are out of reach because the layout includes a large about of wmpty space around the input field.    ### Steps to reproduce - using hyphens as bullet points - list the steps - that reproduce the bug  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20210704-145426](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/124386211-a6d62c80-dcd9-11eb-9690-9d5aecddbee3.png)    ### Device info  **Device:** Manufacturer Model XVI **Android version:** 10.0 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","Meteor0id","2021-07-04T13:09:15Z","2022-02-02T08:59:18Z"

A force close of Signal is required to fix the issue  ### Steps to reproduce  - Send video in chat. - Minimize the app. - Go back to the video and play it, there's no audio. - that reproduce the bug.  **Actual result:** Audio doesn't play in videos sent in chat. **Expected result:** Videos should play fine with audio.   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 18.1 **Signal version:** 5.24.17  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/feb529fde033df688850a522d33914efa148e872c838d1849b997127564b00f6","open","acknowledged,","helpthemfix","2021-10-21T20:01:10Z","2022-07-11T13:09:29Z"

Since an update a few days ago, Signal filters these messages   I appreciate the need to have better security for the masses, but this ""feature"" prevents self-sent text notifications and this is a deal-breaker for me. Yes I could use a third-party online like Matrix, but this requires me to have 24/7 Internet on my phone and I just don't. Texts only require some cellular service, and are much faster to receive (no need to ping a server every xxx seconds).  Filtering my messages without my consent is overreaching. Just because you don't send yourself texts doesn't mean others also don't. No other common SMS app filters messages. Please don't be the first to filter without giving an opt-out option.  Opinions may differ, but I feel that not being able to receive my own texts is a bug. It feels nonsensical that I need to argue that (what is intended as) a spam filter should be possible to turn off, but here we are. Emails also have spam filters, but they can be turned off.  ### Steps to reproduce - set Signal as the default SMS app - send yourself a regular non-Internet text  **Actual result:** Signal ignores the SMS **Expected result:** Signal doesn't ignore the SMS  ### Screenshots   ### Device info  **Device:** **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.34.10  ### Link to debug log","closed","","schklom","2022-04-14T22:22:36Z","2022-04-19T10:46:34Z"

She has a Samsung Galaxy A3 with Android 7. As it crashed immediately and before showing any screen activity, it wasn't even possible to create or send bug reports or send them. Advices in the signal support section concerning battery setting and the likes didn't help. As she was away, the only ""cure"" was to wipe signal, remove and reinstall it. That helped for a while, but now Signal started crashing again. Fortunately she is with me now, so I could attach the phone to my PC and check the logs. This is the error I found:   ### Steps to reproduce - try starting Signal  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) The app crashed, Android shows for a millisecond the crash popup, where you have buttons to contact the developer, however the popup disappears too fast to react.   **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) Signal starts with the known screen.  ### Screenshots  No screenshots possible   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016) **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.29.7  ### debug log     Debug log - click to expand   --------- beginning of crash 01-30 18:45:03.819 10234 10303 E AndroidRuntime:

If a file saved from chat window is named signal-2025-05-05-04-04-04-123.jpg then if we save the same file from ""All media"" menu, then it becomes different as signal-2025-05-05-04-04-04-125.jpg.  Only time the same file with incremental name is saved when we save from same method that is, if we save same file using chat window again then it becomes signal-2025-05-05-04-04-04-123-1.jpg and same goes for ""All media"" menu.  ### Steps to reproduce - Save a media file like a photo from chat window and save same file using ""Media all"" menu.  - This same file gets saved with different names. - Incremental save only happens if a user saves using same method again and which as mentioned earlier won't result in a completely different file name but will have the standard incrementation.  **Actual result:** Same file gets saved with different names. **Expected result:** File should get saved with same name.  ### Screenshots  NA  ### Device info  **Device:** Multiple **Android version:** 4-11 **Signal version:** 5.30.6  ### Link to debug log   NA","closed","wontfix,","desmonk","2022-02-14T09:42:24Z","2022-05-07T08:33:44Z"

Side effects of this bug:  * Feature flags are not refreshed immediately after updating to a newer version * Local metrics may not be cleared after updating  This is the only part of the code base that sets the last version code:   https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/a5e5a735800cbdb3afa01a67390b6efa2fc91be6/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/VersionTracker.java#L24-L39  `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` uses the current version code as the default for when there is no last version code preference stored:  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/a5e5a735800cbdb3afa01a67390b6efa2fc91be6/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/TextSecurePreferences.java#L788-L790  On the first run of the app, the preference would not be set, so `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` uses the current version code as the default. What results is that we don't run the code in the if-statement.   But the `VersionTracker` code is the only part of the entire codebase that actually sets the last version code in the shared preferences, so subsequent runs will result in`TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` **always** defaulting to the current version code. Therefore, it's impossible to set the last version code, because it never enters the if-statement‚Äîthe only place in the code where the last version code is updated.  ### Device info **Device:** HUAWEI MAR-LX3A **Android version:** 10 (10.0.0.277C792, MAR-L03A 10.0.0.277(C792E7R1P3)) **Signal version:** 5.27.1  **Device:** Pixel 5 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.26.11  **Device:** Pixel 3a **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.27.1  Also, on the Pixel 3a with root access (could also access the preferences with a developer, debuggable self-compiled build), I was able to see that the shared preferences XML doesn't contain the `last_version_code` key. The only preference there with `version_code` in it was the last experience version code:  ``` sargo:/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/shared_prefs # grep ""version_code"" org.thoughtcrime.securesms_preferences.xml                                        ```  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/2513b2fbeff28a3fe9de2b7925453decb1db2e05809bff0d7150bd24f2dcc923  This debug log contains an update from 5.26.10 to 5.27.1.   Normally, `VersionTracker` will log out a version upgrade:    https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/a5e5a735800cbdb3afa01a67390b6efa2fc91be6/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/VersionTracker.java#L24-L39  However, `grep VersionTracker 2513b2fbeff28a3fe9de2b7925453decb1db2e05809bff0d7150bd24f2dcc923` on the decompressed log file has no results.  That code path is only run when we have `currentVersionCode != lastVersionCode`. But `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` uses the current version code as the default for when there is no last version code preference stored. Therefore, if the last version code is never stored in the shared preferences, it never enters the if statement.   This section of the code calls `VersionTracker.updateLastSeenVersion`:  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/a5e5a735800cbdb3afa01a67390b6efa2fc91be6/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/migrations/ApplicationMigrations.java#L164-L170  As we can see in the logcat around this section of the code, that ""Upgraded from "" line in `VersionTracker` is never printed  ``` [5.27.1] [main ] 2021-11-18 20:38:04.396 PST D BaseActivity: [ApplicationMigrationAct] onCreate() [5.27.1] [main ] 2021-11-18 20:38:04.409 PST D BaseActivity: [ApplicationMigrationAct] onStart() [5.27.1] [main ] 2021-11-18 20:38:04.411 PST I ApplicationContext: App is now visible.

At around 1`0:28PM` on `February 6 2022` I got it restored and the phone was working fine. I opened Signal. I was **shocked** to see that almost **every message was deleted** that were important to me.

When mobile network is not available then sending message fails (not a Signal issue). After waiting for or searching and finding a network (E, 4G,... ), sending is attempted again and it succeeds. The sent time of the message displays the period of the first attempt. Usually, the sent time is few minutes, whereas it should be few seconds. The difference can be few hours or days, when sending previously failed messages after few hours or days. The issue can be simulated by disallowing mobile network connection on the device.  ### Steps to reproduce - disallow mobile network - attempt to send message - sending message fails - wait few minutes (to allow for larger and significant time difference) - allow mobile networks - resend the message by tapping the red exclamation mark next to the message and `Send`  **Actual result:** Sent time is few minutes just right after the successful sending attempt.

Do a contract refresh by tapping the pencil icon button in the bottom-right and then pulling down to refresh 3. Tap Back, then your contact's profile picture, and notice your contact still doesn't display as being on Signal 4. Go into the app switcher and swipe Signal away to kill it (here I was attempting to force a reload from the system contact database) 5. Notice your contact still doesn't show as being on Signal 6. Have your contact text you on Signal and notice it shows up as a separate conversation and in particular, as a message request from an unknown contact. (Not sure how this interacts with everything else, but this is what happened to me) 7. Tap the three dots menu, then ""Add to contact"" and pick your existing contact for this person 8. Notice the suggested number is the exact same. Delete the suggestion and change the existing phone number entry to match the suggested type - that is, ""Mobile"" instead of ""Other"" 9. Go back into the app home screen. Notice that the Signal conversation now displays your contact's name, and the SMS conversation now simply says ""Unknown"".  **Actual result**/**Expected result:**   See STR - unfortunately there seem to be multiple related behaviors here so it's kind of difficult to separate out exactly when things went wrong.

Normally that wouldn't be a problem but this friend does not check it so it is kind of a problem.  ### Steps to reproduce - Set Signal as your default SMS app - Go to a conversation with a phone number that *does* have a Signal account - Type out a message and long-press the send button and select ""Insecure SMS"". - Press and hold the voice note button, say a message then release it. **Actual result:** The voice message sends over the signal network. **Expected result:** The voice message sends over the cellular network as an MMS.  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 4a **Android version:** 11 I think **Signal version:** 5.28.5  ### Notes  From what I understand the ability to send SMS/MMS messages to Signal users from within the app has been pretty controversial and I can't claim to have any insight one way or the other about whether it's correct behavior to send an insecure message containing data from the microphone with what could be an accidental tap. But what I can say with certainty is that I can't use Signal as a default SMS app anymore because of this issue which is a shame because it's really convenient to have everything inside of Signal :( It doesn't need to be convenient to send voice notes to my SMS-conversation friends but I do need the ability to do it somehow using an external voice recorder app or something.","closed","wontfix,","ellenhp","2021-12-31T16:38:20Z","2022-03-12T15:48:57Z"

This results in a lot of inconsistent state  1. I was removed from every group chat I was previously in, with no way to rejoin (short of getting someone to re-add me) 2. All of my old chats with others transfered correctly and appear unified to me; however: 3. For all my contacts, my messages now come from a new contact *with the same old phone number*, but with an empty chat history. All previous messages are associated with a different contact that has no phone number attached. 4. All my old ""Note to Self"" messages are now listed as a chat with user ""Aditya Mukerjee"", and new notes to myself are listed as a separate chat.   ### Steps to reproduce  Here are the steps I took, and I believe they should reliably reproduce the bug.  - Initiate transfer to new phone - After a while, the old device says that the transfer has completed, but the new device still says ""Transferring Signal to a new phone"" and spins indefinitely. I believe the issue here is because the screen turned off during the transfer. - Set the screen display timeout to 30 minutes - Initiate transfer to new phone (this time, ""Transferring Signal to a new phone"" terminates on the new device) - Begin the registration flow. I have two phone numbers (one which I only use while traveling, and my main one, which is registered to Signal). Signal automatically detects my traveling number, *not* the one which was registered on the old device, so I end up using that to proceed with the transfer - The new device *is* now registered correctly; however, the old device is stuck on the modal which has two options - I forget the exact wording, but something like ""Cancel and keep this device registered"" vs. ""Okay"". Clicking the second one causes the modal to flash, disappear for a split second, and reappear. In other words, the old device is stuck in this state with no way to proceed, while the new device appears to be working correctly. Presumably this is because the phone number differs. - I realize that the devices are registered to different phone numbers, so I attempt to fix this by going to Account >> Change phone number, which appears to be the only way forward (the old device is stuck on the modal, so there's no way to do anything else with it. - This ""works"", except now I have been removed from all my old groups, and also all of my contacts are having issues contacting me.  Weirdly, Signal **does** correctly ask for the PIN associated with the account when reregistering the phone number, so it does know that the old account exists somehow, but it doesn't actually recognize the account that the phone number was attached to.  I tried reregistering the phone number to the old phone to see if that would fix it, but it does not - the old phone, even after reregistering the old phone number, still appears to be using a separate profile from what it used before. I can't figure out any way to transfer that profile, let alone merge the two.  This is problematic because it incorrectly shows me as ""not a Signal user"" in my old chats when other people try to message me, and when I message them, it shows up as a ""message request"", even though I'm already in their contacts.  **Actual result:** Transfer works successfully **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots   #### After registering the number to the old phone:  ![Screenshot_20220527-114231~2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/376414/170734160-46d8d60b-8947-491c-9c4f-2127db41ee6c.png)  #### What it looks like for an established contact to send me a message when the number is registered to the old phone:  ![Screenshot_20220527-115000~3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/376414/170735160-0b4913f2-d510-408d-889a-ed5eb0ce93ad.png) ![Screenshot_20220527-114948](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/376414/170735170-f6ee0add-79d0-4989-b950-b3d8649dd877.png) ![Screenshot_20220527-115523](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/376414/170735382-b0308568-2f50-4074-819e-a5f65fa8e020.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 6 Pro **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.36.3  ### Link to debug log","closed","","ChimeraCoder","2022-05-27T15:40:12Z","2022-05-31T13:25:34Z"

I'm running pixel experience ROM based on Android 12 but it is persistent on stock MIUI and multiple other ROMs as well.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Call somebody - Notice that you can't hear much  **Actual result:** During voice calls, the earpiece speaker is horribly quiet, even on the highest volume. In the city center or even anywhere outdoor it makes talking absolutely not possible. Audio also appears to be really low quality but maybe that's just me. **Expected result:** The volume of it should be the same as on regular phone calls.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Poco X3 NFC **Android version:** 12 (Pixel Experience) **Signal version:** 5.30.2 beta  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/fbdc1a88c0154e1acdfd0df34b0967d0e1f6fb4afef1fd5889ee834a076eca5e","closed","wontfix,","Zipos","2022-01-28T12:21:34Z","2022-04-11T20:02:09Z"

But, if the connection is quickly restored, two-way audio is resumed and, in the case of video calls, one-way video from A to B is also resumed.  At this point, A still sees the ""Network failed!"" screen and thinks the call has ended, but she can actually still hear B and B can still hear (and see, in case of video calls) her. If A tries to click ""Cancel"" and call B once again, this just leads back to the ""Network failed!"" screen. The only way A can hang up the call is using the button in the call notification, which is still there.  On the other side, A's audio (and video) just froze to B and, after some seconds, the call continues just as before with B being able to hear (and see in case of video calls) A just as before.  ### Steps to reproduce  - Use Wi-Fi only in both devices (turn off mobile data). - Establish a video call from A to B. - In A, turn the Wi-Fi off and then immediately on again. - Wait for the connection to be re-establish, and then wait for some seconds.  **Actual result:** A can now hear B once again, and B can now both see and hear A.  **Expected result:** All audio and video should cease and the call should end for B as well.  ### Device info  I reproduced in more devices, but I'm submitting debug logs for 2:  **Device:** moto g(7) plus **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.32.15  **Device:** RealMe 6 RMX2001 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.32.15  ### Link to debug log  - https://debuglogs.org/android/5.32.15/139d307079380d48fa47327ff051a5835996b1cc9355f9545b53bb7bc506c5de - https://debuglogs.org/android/5.32.15/d1e9dcd04e12373281945607e2c678e6dd2c1edaf8e70b5a6a010e285aa6ea24","closed","","drebs","2022-03-22T01:23:28Z","2022-05-26T21:32:12Z"

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: When you try to make a new group with the same people as you've had in a group before, it should automatically detect that, and _use that same group chat_ when you go to send a message, instead of making a new group chat.  DETAILS:  I want to send a message to person1 and person2, so I search for their names in the Android app using the search tool to search prior messages. I can't find our previous group chat where all 3 of us texted (note: I left it NOT named when I made it months ago and messaged them). _This seems to be the first bug! Search doesn't work properly when looking for previous group chats by the names of the members in that group._  So, I make a new group (unnamed still), and send a message. It works. **BUG: But, when they respond, it shows up on the old group chat which now comes to the top.** That's very confusing. My latest message TO them is in the **new** group chat, and their responses back are in the **old** one, breaking up the continuity of the messages.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Create an unnamed group chat with you plus 2 people. Send a message. Ensure one or both of them respond. It works fine. 2. Create _another_ unnamed group chat with the same people. Send a message. When one of them responds, their response will show up in the OTHER group chat above (the _old_ group chat), instead of in the one you just created (the _new_ group chat).  **Actual result:** see above. **Expected result:** There should not be 2 separate group chats with those same people. When you tried to make the 2nd group chat, it should have directed you into the first one with those same people, so that your new message to them and their new responses back are all in the same group chat!  ### Screenshots  None  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.24.14  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/72dc44234d48f58fc61b4cceac487eea0ac0d2be4b1a996517313ac71eb7169c","closed","wontfix,","ElectricRCAircraftGuy","2021-10-17T04:19:50Z","2022-02-02T01:05:43Z"

That previous issue was closed because there is an option to send SMS, but the user can be misled into thinking a new contact is using Signal when they are not. The interface tells the user that the recipient is on Signal, and it's too easy to miss messages going undelivered.   ![signal-bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73763003/181398302-3b5081ce-86e0-4309-80f1-6c87e961703f.png)  Reporting as a bug rather than a feature suggestion because this is a usability issue stemming from lack of error prevention and failing to help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (see Nielsen Norman Group's ""[10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)"").   **Context leading to this problem:** - I switched to a new phone three years ago but didn't download Signal right away. When I finally did, I just texted my contacts as usual without checking what kind of send button I was pressing (secure vs SMS), including to my elderly father. I just now realized that he had not been receiving my messages for over a year. Given the way he texts, plus my failure to differentiate the different Signal icons on my end, I had no idea. I thought it was weird once he didn't receive a picture, but assumed his phone simply failed to receive the MMS and didn't think further, resending over email. I only noticed this when I did because of the next problem just below. - I was establishing contact with someone new and the app notified me *that this person was also on Signal*. After realizing they didn't receive my messages for a few weeks I finally tried reaching out with SMS. Turns out they had used Signal on their last phone, and there was no way for me to know they no longer had it, especially when Signal itself told me the contrary. - Tech savvy users, or users without cognitive difficulties will be more likely to notice something wrong‚Äîperhaps they'll have another way of corresponding with the recipient, a common contact, etc. and recover from this problem. Users with less technological experience, who are coming back to Signal to major UI changes after a long period away (like myself), or who have learning difficulties may not realize this issue for a very long while on their own. Many will assume they're being ignored by the recipient, leading to frustration.  Addressing this issue would make Signal a more accessible, user-friendly app.  ### Steps to reproduce - Download Signal onto three phones - Exchange Signal messages between phone 1 and phone 2 - Delete the app on phone 2 - Wait as long as you like - Attempt to send a message from phone 3 to phone 2 using the Signal app  **Actual result:** It is unclear from the UI that the message has not been delivered and never will be. The UI also claims that the recipient is on Signal when they are not.  **Expected result:**  - **Signal could prevent the issue by notifying the user when a message has not been delivered to a recipient after a certain period of time.** Signal can then suggest resending as an SMS, and remind the user on how to long press the send button to do so. This will help with error prevention. - **Signal can also better differentiate their icon set (sent, delivered, and read), so that users are more likely to realize when a message has not been received.** All of those icons are some variation of a checkmark, which can be misleading for new users since a checkmark implies success. Users may also confuse sent/potentially delivered SMS messages (single checkmark plus an open padlock) with non-delivered Signal messages (single checkmark). More strongly distinguishing the three (such as by changing the sent icon from a single checkmark to something else) would also aid users in recognizing an undelivered message.  - **Signal should not tell the user that a recipient is ""on Signal"" when that recipient has been inactive from Signal for an extended period of time.**   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.43.7","open","","ajmpapin","2022-07-28T01:27:13Z","2022-07-30T12:44:40Z"

At some point, the option to change a contact's color stopped changing the contact's message bubbles and started changing mine.  This is backwards.  I can now no longer identify my conversations by color.  I have sent several emails over the last few months trying to indicate this bug, but have not received any responses.  Maybe submitting here will get this resolved faster?  This issue has been unbelievably frustrating and just a constant pain. I really like signal, but this is getting to be a deal-killer since I am constantly having to figure out who I'm conversing with or who said what, since my brain is instantly drawn to the colored text which I assume would be the person I'm conversing with.  And far from being something I'm starting to acclimate to, it's making me more frustrated as time goes on because it seems like such an obvious oversight and a simple fix.  Obviously I don't need *my* text highlighted in a color, as I know what I just wrote. But I do need the ability to quickly see the text of the person I'm conversing with.   ### Steps to reproduce  Happens in any chat.  Seems like someone literally coded a setting for the wrong thing?  Should be easy enough to fix.   At first I thought it was just my machine, so I un-installed signal and then re-installed it.   That didn't fix the issue.  I then started encountering the issue on desktop as well (or maybe it was Desktop first, it's been so long I can't remember) and it seemed that the issue was impacting multiple platforms.  I've since done a phone wipe and a PC format and the issue persists.  I've experienced the same thing on multiple machines, so it does seem that it's an issue with the app itself.   **Actual result:**  My chat messaged get the color that should be for my contact  **Expected result:** Changing chat color should change my contact's messages so I can quickly identify and read them.   ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Manufacturer Model XVI **Android version:** 0.0.0 **Signal version:** 0.0.0  ### Link to debug log","closed","","cavemank1","2022-01-13T02:40:28Z","2022-01-15T20:28:53Z"

I just don't understand what motivated this change.  it just doesn't seem to make any sense, like it was a mistake or something.

This behavior was not present before and does disappear when i switch from my Wifi to LTE. This is very weird, because my Wifi is very stable and fast (200/20 Mbit)  with 20 ms ping and almost no jitter and packet loss according to Speedtest.net.  I already tried connecting to different APs, including the router itself, which did not change much. I also tested it with different contacts and it always resulted in the same stutter/ lag.  This bug makes calling with Signal nearly impossible for me, which is very unfortunate... In fact i really liked the call quality from Signal and recommended it to my friends. WhatsApp calls work just fine btw...  I know that this might be not enough information to debug this problem, but don't know of anything else that i could do. But feel free to tell me what i could do, this happens with any call right from the beginning anyway...  ### Steps to reproduce - Connect to my home wifi - Start a call with any person  **Actual result:** Call is very distorted with lag/ dropped sections/ stutter **Expected result:** Call should not be distorted  ### Screenshots ---   ### Device info  **Device:** Poco F3 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.27.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/f30e69935bb2d876bef4ab6d1d377d4e19f00015c193cdbfc6c0a72188676aa6","closed","wontfix,","major-mayer","2021-11-24T20:43:17Z","2022-07-09T04:46:45Z"

This has been going on for at least 1.5 years.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive either a notification of messages with images in any conversation of any length (either straight uploaded images or images attached to previews), OR be using the ""attached"" desktop client for a period of time conversing and receive said images - Finally open the Android client scroll backward in the message history - See random ""swaths"" of messages (sometimes just one, sometimes dozens) where the images have not loaded - Click on the little image download icon to instruct client to load images - In shorter conversations this occurs quickly, right away - On longer lengthy conversations (10's or 100's of thousands of messages), it can take minutes for the image to finally load. You often have to select over and over to finally get the image loaded  **Actual result:** Images eventually load, 99% of the time. Occasionally, they refuse to load at all (if it is too old, say more than two weeks, or rarely, one will just not load)  **Expected result:** Images should be loaded when the message is received  ### Screenshots  ![UnloadedIMGs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40615139/126559325-1bf7cb85-feb3-48c1-a28d-688ba22e0f06.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Essential PH1 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.16.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/fd0284900a47aa2506c6aaede0d64507af3bab5e4f466114cb4a4764fcbc85aa","closed","wontfix,","ultrajae","2021-07-21T20:58:51Z","2022-02-02T06:09:38Z"

The message shows having not been delivered with the little red circle with an exclamation point in it.  ### Steps to reproduce This condition is persistent.  I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, but I *think* it may be the result of doing this: 1. Use Signal to handle SMS messages. 2. Find an area where you don't have a connection to the cellular network. 3. Compose a message that requires at least TWO SMS messages because of the standard size limit for SMS text messages, so over 160 characters long. 4. Send it at the edge of the area where the cellular network signal goes out.  You may have to do this a few times to observe the result.  Why I think this might demonstrate the problem I experienced: The app probably got into the loop for sending a message of length > 160, succeeded in sending the first 160 characters, and thus passed the test that exit with error if the message could not be sent"" (because ""it"" was sent, meaning only the first 160 characters), but then enters a loop to send the rest, which doesn't have the logic of recognizing that (part of) a message can't be sent and to therefore exit because it's in the logic at the point where the code __starts__ sending a message, but not included in the inner loop to handle long messages.  In fact, this might be an unsolvable bug of the mechanism of handling SMS messages is still required by the OS to use some code inside the native SMS handler to handle long messages.  Well, not unsolvable, but requiring collaboration between the app devs and the OS devs.  After uninstalling Signal, the long message I wanted to send was sent in its entirety without any intervention from me, by the native Android SMS system, and obviously when I was connected to the cellular (or Wifi?) network.  This all happened at my house where I have both cellular and wifi, but where both are weak signals.  Does Signal use WiFi to send SMS?  If not, then the Wifi is immaterial, obviously.  **Actual result:** Repetitive notifications of a message that failed to send which don't stop even after closing the app (I may not have waited long enough for Android OS to unload it) and restarting.  Closing the app would stop the notifications for about a minute and then they'd start up again.  **Expected result:** One notification would be sufficient.  A different message would also be appropriate (if I'm right about what happened), that says ""Message only partially sent.""  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy 7 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** Since I re-installed the latest, this is only correct if my phone recently (automatically, because I've never upgraded manually) upgraded itself: 5.14.5  ### Link to debug log Sorry, I uninstalled and reinstalled before I could grab it.","closed","","dscotese","2021-06-28T19:59:45Z","2022-01-26T18:54:53Z"

Eg:  `{smsNum}?body={body} : {realPhoneNumHere}{messageHere}`  The actual message has 0 prefilled.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Scan a QR code that has ?parameters to send a prefilled text message. 2. Watch the ""to"" field containing the entire API line. 3. Even if you filled the body and sent, it's still broken due to the to field being messed up.  **Actual result:** Prefill params are all in the ""to"" area: Need to change default app to anything _except_ Signal to work (it's just you guys that don't follow these standards, it appears).  **Expected result:** Message should be prefilled as standardized.  ### Screenshots TODO  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S20+ **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log  n/a","open","acknowledged,","dylanh724","2021-07-07T14:26:29Z","2022-04-27T15:30:56Z"

Using phone to message. Messaged a contact who was previously on signal but isn't now and shows up as normal sms contact. Last night all the messages were still there with this contact. Now they are gone! The following steps are what was going on when this happened as I don't want to try to reproduce!  ### Steps to reproduce - messaging former signal contact with sms messages (signal shows them as sms contact)  - tried to send sms message. - popped up a box that said a lot of messages were getting sent and asked if I should allow or deny this, tried to tap allow, but there was no response... same with deny - then dinging (notifications) started and went so fast it sounded almost like a continuous sound which lasted maybe 30 seconds. - Finally when I tapped the home button several times, it went to the home screen and the dinging stopped. - Opening signal to send the same contact a message and all message history with the contact is gone!    ### Device info  **Device:** stock Verizon galaxy s21 **Android version:** 11.0 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/0597e0bd8af1f5d27948b9678c4cf077a7ebcc61c8220cc76a8953b29b28b445","closed","wontfix,","jeremymasters","2021-07-02T16:27:29Z","2022-02-02T08:59:14Z"

(Dual SIM with UK in second slot)  ### Steps to reproduce - call number from dialer  - open number and select send message - number is stuck on without preceding zero  - local numbers that are selected to message are also pulled across without preceding zero, UNLESS country code manually added in contact field  **Actual result:**  Message seems to fail.  Doesn't occur with UK numbers. **Expected result:** just seems to suggest message was sent but no   ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S20 ultra 5g One UI 3,1 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5,27.9  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","qasteroid","2021-12-02T20:05:24Z","2022-04-09T12:00:53Z"

A real  example of this links i get regularly from fedex. The link text format looks like this fedex.com/t//en_US  Signal recognizes that fedex.com is a URL and underlines the text and makes it clickable. Clicking this URL does nothing   This only seems to happen when signal is acting as the default SMS app and only only with links send via SMS.   ### Steps to reproduce - Receive a link formatted as described above over SMS (signal is the default messaging app - click the link - ??? - profit   **Actual result:** Clicking the link does nothing other than visually showing the link was clicked (the underline disappears momentarily)  **Expected result:** Clicking the link should open the link in a browser window  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S22 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.42.8  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/android/5.42.8/baa768267d1160935f5bf2690434f1a1d9f957504cb86028da0062216f447372","closed","","adiastra","2022-07-19T14:03:47Z","2022-07-22T15:11:04Z"

Everything went quite smooth, I have GooglePlayServices installed and it works for all apps using it, I'm not rooted.  Signal worked for a day without issue, I could register, send/receive message and notification, and then after a day, Signal started complaining that Google Play Services was missing.  Now the notification: ""Permanent Signal communication faillure!, Signal was unable to register with Google Play Services."" If I click the notification I got a popup saying: "" Signal won't run without Google Play services, which are not supported by your device.""  This last sentence triggered me as it's twice false. Signal is supposed to working without Google (with WebSocket) and my device do have Google Play services installed and updated to the latest version, I'm logged to a Google account (thus I disable all sync as I don't use my account for other than Play Store).  On top of that, if I ignore the notification, Signal is working perfectly, without any delay in notification or whatever.  Any idea why it's doing that? I have used Signal since it was TextSecure and I was using it on CyanogenMod at the time, I have always used CM and then LineageOS (thus always rooted, it's no more the case) with Google Play Services and Signal has always worked without any single issue (like any other app). Now Signal is the only one have trouble so I don't think it's an issue on the ROM side or Play services side.  Any clue how to solve that, beside disabling the failure notification from Signal (that will prevent me to know when there will be a real failure then)?  ### Steps to reproduce Just wait that Signal complain.   ### Screenshots None   ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 **Android version:** Lineage OS 18.1, Android 11 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/faa5dd73a8446293d84bb9a1d8c6bb6e700b821a4417f7b75bb61357d4f64d68","closed","","ElucGeek","2021-07-06T21:16:32Z","2022-01-04T19:10:04Z"

However, if a [work profile](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en) is enabled, only the personal profile contacts are listed. Also, when an SMS message is received from a work profile contact, it's treated as a message from an unknown contact (i.e. no profile picture or name is shown, just the number).  ### Steps to reproduce - Make Signal the SMS app - Enable a work profile, with contacts - Add a new contact to both the work profile and the personal profile, with similar names. In my screenshots, these contacts are named ""Test Account - Work"" and ""Test Account - Personal"", respectively. - Tap the ""New Message"" pencil icon - Search the newly-created contacts.  **Actual result:** Only the contact created in the personal profile, ""Test Account - Personal"", appears. **Expected result:** Both accounts appear in the search list.  ### Screenshots  After creating the accounts, in Android's ""Contacts"" app: ![Screenshot_20210723-100308_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/676184/126794653-f1c7e990-aad4-4d5a-8efd-bb1fa0af1fcb.png) Searching for the contacts when writing a new message in Signal: ![Screenshot_20210723-100805](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/676184/126794625-8f9aab33-22fc-4085-bccd-b32c77994601.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** Android 12 Beta 3 **Signal version:** 5.17.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/df1c8155b3b9a0c069117822eaa1d24a3c26cc069fb0303de660e341b8ae80c3","closed","wontfix,","tkterris","2021-07-23T14:15:07Z","2022-02-02T06:09:40Z"

In `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.sharing.ShareActivity`, before initiating the search/chooser interface, check for the following extra intent field and handle a direct share immediately if it is present: `EXTRA_SHORTCUT_ID`.

The contacts are linked and aggregated from these raw contacts. Names are stored in the data table with the fields described [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName), both in ‚Äúunstructured‚Äù (field [DISPLAY_NAME](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#DISPLAY_NAME)) and ‚Äústructured‚Äù form (fields [PREFIX](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#PREFIX), [GIVEN_NAME](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#GIVEN_NAME), [MIDDLE_NAME](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#MIDDLE_NAME), [FAMILY_NAME](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#FAMILY_NAME), [SUFFIX](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#SUFFIX)). When synchronizing the contact, Signal adds a new raw contact and a name data row, setting the unstructured name but not the structured name fields. In this case, the system‚Äôs contacts provider tries to guess the structured name fields. ‚ÄúGiven, Suffix‚Äù looks as if it was in ‚Äú\, \‚Äù format, so it sets GIVEN_NAME to ‚ÄúSuffix‚Äù and FAMILY_NAME to ‚ÄúGiven‚Äù. Raw contacts have both a primary and alternative display name field. As they have both, the name data row‚Äôs [DISPLAY_NAME](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.StructuredName#DISPLAY_NAME) can‚Äôt taken (as it‚Äôs unknown whether it‚Äôs in primary or alternative format). Instead it synthesizes them from the structured name fields. The generated primary display name is ‚ÄúSuffix Given‚Äù and the generated alternative display name is ‚ÄúGiven, Suffix‚Äù. The contact‚Äôs names are taken from the raw contact with the ‚Äúbest‚Äù names. In the example, Signal‚Äôs raw contact happens to be selected as having the ‚Äúbest‚Äù names (note that this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if the existing name data row had the [IS_SUPER_PRIMARY](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.DataColumns#IS_SUPER_PRIMARY) flag, set if the contact was manually created by the user but not if imported from a VCard). Because I set my phone to show names in primary format, the wrong name ‚ÄúSuffix Given‚Äù is shown in various places (contact book, dialer and Signal).  ### Possible solution  Currently, the system has only limited information (unstructured name but not structured name) when the raw contact is inserted by Signal, so it can‚Äôt really do any better. If Signal set the structured name fields, the name would stay correct.","open","","manueljacob","2022-06-23T00:00:44Z","2022-06-23T00:00:44Z"

Sometimes, when the phone is plugged in and on LTE with USB tethering, `org.thoughtcrime.securesms` starts using 20-30% CPU in the background. This happens randomly and does not coincide with receiving messages. The high CPU usage continues indefinitely (once my phone ran out of battery and shut down) if left untouched. Unplugging from the charger does not stop it. The only way to stop it is to either open Signal, rebooting or force stop Signal. Doing any of these stops the high CPU usage immediately.  Output from `adb shell top` (probably not helpful, but this is how I found out it was Signal) ``` User 26%, System 10%, IOW 0%, IRQ 1% User 318 + Nice 0 + Sys 124 + Idle 734 + IOW 3 + IRQ 12 + SIRQ 10 = 1201  PID  USER     PR  NI CPU% S  #THR     VSS     RSS PCY Name 8596 u0_a324  20   0  25% R    89 4130916K 240436K  bg org.thoughtcrime.securesms 1485 system   18  -2   2% R   218 2704476K 296628K  fg system_server 679  system   -2  -8   1% S    15 258936K   8544K  fg /system/bin/surfaceflinger 1871 u0_a80   20   0   1% S    39 1861412K 152232K  fg com.android.systemui  ```  Because the phone is plugged in, Android battery monitoring doesn't seem to measure its usage and it actually took me a while to realize it was Signal. I have had Signal for over a year now and this only started happening around 1.5 months ago. I didn't update Signal until it said it would expire so the last working version would've been around 4 months ago.  ### Things I have tried - Scratch head - No change - Reboot phone - Issue returns after a few days - Reinstall Signal (twice) - No change  Looked through debug logs and bug report to find any correlation. In the latest occurrence (02:44 AM today, screenshot below), it coincided with a `RESET:TIME` event and the battery dropped from 100% to 95%. Then it plummets from there and Signal goes crazy. Looking at the Signal logs at that time, however shows nothing.  I am not super familiar with Android but in many devices, the battery stops charging when it reaches 100% and allows it to drop to around 95% before recommencing charging to reduce wear to the battery from constantly keeping it at 100%. Is it possible that the event triggers something in Signal that causes it to get stuck in a loop? I know it monitors the charging state to determine when it should do a backup so maybe that's a lead.  ```          +23m59s020ms (2) 100 d2080020 stats=0:""write""          +27m32s088ms (2) 100 d2080020 temp=255          +31m12s192ms (2) 100 d2080020 stats=0:""get-stats""          +31m55s540ms (2) 100 d2080020 status=full        +6h18m41s076ms (50) RESET:TIME: 2021-09-09-02-44-26        +6h18m41s076ms (3) 096 d2080020 status=charging health=good plug=usb temp=315 volt=4129 charge=0 +running +wake_lock +wifi_full_lock +mobile_radio +plugged phone_signal_strength=great +wifi_running +charging wifi_suppl=disconn fg=u0a254:""com.digibites.accubattery""                  Details: cpu=9310u+10120s                           /proc/stat=9820 usr, 9590 sys, 1210 io, 970 irq, 640 sirq, 67900 idle (24.7% of 15m 1s 300ms), PlatformIdleStat null        +6h18m41s076ms (2) 096 d2080020 fg=u0a285:""com.mc.miband1""        +6h18m41s076ms (2) 096 d2080020 fg=u0a271:""com.gsamlabs.bbm""        +6h18m41s076ms (2) 096 d2080020 top=u0a91:""com.sonymobile.home""        +6h18m41s076ms (2) 096 d2080020 user=0:""0""        +6h18m41s076ms (2) 096 d2080020 userfg=0:""0""        +6h18m41s076ms (2) 096 d2080020 longwake=u0a254:""Charging"" ```  I can't think of anything else but to install Android Studio and install Signal with debug symbols so I can profile it the next time this happens. Any tips would be appreciated as I am not super familiar with the Android ecosystem.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Signal - Plug into a router/laptop and turn on USB tethering (don't know if this is relevant) - Wait for phone to get hot and battery to drain faster than it can charge (500mA source) (may take a day or two)  **Actual result:** CPU usage increases, phone gets hot **Expected result:** Not the above  ### Device info **Device:** Sony Xperia XZs Dual G8232 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 5.21.6  Extra info: - **Google Play Services installed and enabled** and I am getting FCM messages so it's not [this](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9729) - Battery optimizations for Signal is disabled - Background data unrestricted - I am not in any large groups (2 groups with ~20 people each)  ### Screenshot ![0-02-07-fe58704a89f939c590f5bd4cb37f6e57a575ecdf98069b32b9868e6cb7872dc4_953aac312d0aa73c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85420642/132643498-91006e35-7fda-472e-b226-6c808783854a.jpg)   ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1e3fc3ea0e4cfcf5eeec04b67aab547341662ae04fac5b56a87ebe2ee0ab7f49  Bug reports also available.

When this message is within the visible messages on screen, it is obvious. When this message is off screen, it is more difficult to judge which message you have jumped to as the highlighted message is often not placed in the same position each time. This is especially difficult when replying to audio messages, as there is no text to use as reference.  It may also be the case that sometimes the white highlight (I am in dark mode) is not displayed, or it is extremely easy to miss as it is displayed quickly. I imagine this is also the case on iOS devices. (does this want a duplicate bug report?) Comparatively, on desktop the indicator is blue and larger.  ### Steps to reproduce - reply to a message directly (e.g. quoted) - send more messages until it is off screen - tap the quoted message to jump to it - try to decide which message are you meant to be looking at  **Actual result:**  No visible highlight, or highlight is displayed too quickly to see and the message location on screen is inconsistent.  **Expected result:**  Large obvious highlight, which remains on screen for a longer period.

Might be similar to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/12235#issuecomment-1158917837 but report contained only minimal info and didn't seem to relate to app state.  ### Steps to reproduce - Default Android notification sounds enabled for Signal - Set conversation specific Messages *sound* to Silent, not entire conversation/notification - Have conversation open - Receive message  **Actual result:** Default notification sound plays **Expected result:** No sound is played  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S22 Ultra **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.40.4.1 & 5.41.10  ### Link to debug log","closed","","Infraded","2022-06-28T19:11:16Z","2022-07-11T21:03:58Z"

Specifically on horizontal mode, the picture is quite narrow. Problems:  - This is in generally inconvenient, unnecessarily cropped images = lost information. - This might leak information about the device aspect ratio.  ### Steps to reproduce - In a chat conversation I start the add picture from camera function  1. - I hold the phone horizontally **Actual result:**  - The preview is over the whole phone screen, the aspect ratio is quite narrow  2.  - I hold the phone is vertically **Actual result:**  - The preview is not over the whole phone screen, there is a black bar on the right (=bottom of the phone if held vertically), but still not the actual aspect ratio of the camera (4:3)  **Expected result:**  - The preview is exactly the size of the camera aspect ratio, with a black bar to fill the rest.     ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 6 Pro **Android version:** 12 (SQ1D.220205.004) **Signal version:** 5.32.7     Maybe somewhat related to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8292 and it's many ""reopen"" issues...","open","acknowledged,","blaueente","2022-02-20T21:42:18Z","2022-07-01T14:25:38Z"

None of the controls or screen functions are available until about 5 seconds after the call is established or dropped. This is happening with Signal only, no other messanger is behaving like this. This causes some of the calls to go unanswered, and in other cases the call can't be dropped.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open signal for Android - Select contact - Tap call button on top - Screen gets locked, and disabled. Power button, volume controls or screen taps are all disabled. or - Get somebody to call you - Wait for a call - As soon as the call is coming screen gets locked, and disabled. Power button, volume controls or screen taps are all disabled, there's no way to answer the call. - On second attempt, the screen is still disabled, but the controls to anwer or decline are showing on the screen.  **Actual result:** Screen is locked and disabled and there's no way to answer the call or when calling to enable/disable mic or speaker or drop the call. **Expected result:** Screen should be left exactly as it was when starting a call, or receiving a call. There should be no change to the phone state. The controls to answer/reject call should always be visible on the screen during a call in progress.  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus Nord N10 5G **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.28.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/ba9874798cada230071c183765d0c7532217b7aa31c4c737cf21b476406c1ff6","closed","wontfix,","dr3adl0rd","2021-12-24T12:24:39Z","2022-03-12T14:48:57Z"

However, if I name the group ""John and Jane"" and do a search for ""John,"" the conversation is listed in the results. Additionally, searching for John's phone number only shows the one on one conversations, not the group conversation.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start at the list of conversations. - Tap the magnifying glass. - Enter name or number (any search criteria) which would identify a member of a group conversation. - Unnamed group conversations are not included in the conversation list (matching messages are still listed).  Named groups are also omitted unless the search criteria matches the name of the group.  **Actual result:** Unnamed groups are not listed.  Named groups are omitted unless the search criteria matches the name of the group.  **Expected result:** Groups conversations are listed based on search criteria for one individual member of the group (name or phone #).  ### Screenshots NA  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung SM-A516U1 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.19.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/df416a5ba065a6482090f6f69676542ee851a43ce06af236bf8cfa0a825fef06","closed","","fleapower","2021-08-10T15:11:20Z","2022-04-12T17:03:41Z"

You can for example jump to a quoted message, a search result in a conversation etc.  The highlight functionality does work for jumps to messages that are already visible before the jump.

Apart from being annoying for developers, I suspect that the observed log spam could even be a performance problem. **Expected result:** This error message is not an actual problem and should be silently ignored.  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 3T **Android version:** LineageOS 18.1 **Signal version:** 5.22.8  ### Debug log  ``` 09-14 19:30:00.957 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.958 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.958 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.958 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.959 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.959 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.960 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.961 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.961 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.961 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.962 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.962 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.963 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.963 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.963 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.964 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.964 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.965 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.965 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent 09-14 19:30:00.966 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupBase$BackupEvent 09-14 19:30:00.966 19225 19273 D EventBus: No subscribers registered for event class org.greenrobot.eventbus.NoSubscriberEvent ```","closed","","ByteHamster","2021-09-14T17:49:49Z","2021-09-16T17:20:30Z"

They can be vastly bigger than the actual data used by the Signal app. Forwarding messages inflates backup size while Signal App Data Size does not change.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a large-ish file or media (a couple megabytes) - Create a backup and note down: Backup size & Signal app data usage - Forward the file one or more times - Create another backup, then compare backup sizes & Signap app data usage  **Actual result:** The Backup file size increases by the size of the forwarded file while Signal App usage does not. For example, in the case of another persons Signal i observed 400MB of app data usage while the backup file size was about 1GB. **Expected result:** If Signal deduplicates forwarded messages internally they should also be deduplicated in backup files. The backup file should not be considerably larger than Signals app data.  ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Redmi 4X **Android version:** LineageOS 15.1 based on AOSP 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 5.18.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/bb268c5fb8102c6c3430235813b64721c100dec8c3ac8dfe71885073a2133fc1","open","acknowledged,","SebiderSushi","2021-08-01T16:15:39Z","2022-04-12T19:42:14Z"

I just upgraded from a Pixel XL to this S21 and no longer see where I can disable invite prompts to contacts that are not using Signal; contacts I am only interacting with using SMS. If this was intentional (re: a marketing tactic) I would ask that you reverse this decision; adding an extra action per interaction for a feature I'm not interested in can be frustrating for a user.  ### Steps to reproduce - Navigate to the latest version of Signal as of issue creation. - Interact with a non-Signal user. - Be prompted to view insights and invite the user to Signal. (The prompt is blue and lives at the top of the 1:1 chat with a dark theme). - Navigate to Insights and Settings. There used to be an option in Chat, or elsewhere, that allows you to disable invite prompts.  **Actual result:** Invite prompts persist because there is no Boolean option anymore. **Expected result:** I should be able to disable these invite prompts. Ultimately, some of the people I message are not going to use Signal (older family, etc.) so the extra action per conversation creates a pain point that didn't exist before.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S21 5G **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.13.18","closed","wontfix,","bknie1","2021-06-22T01:45:34Z","2022-02-02T08:59:05Z"

If I had sent the picture from the Desktop version, the problem would have been obvious.  ### Steps to reproduce - have two contacts for a friend (i.e. a friend w/ two phone numbers, one possibly in disuse / from a different country) - open signal app on Android - switch to the main screen (conversations list?) if necessary - tap a conversation w/ the contact - tap the title line (contact name) to get the contact card - tap üõ°Ô∏è View safety number - wait for the cute animation to settle - tap and hold the numbers under the QR code - select Copy to clipboard - share them w/ contact via a trusted mechanism - they check (also on android) the safety number and get a different number - they send back the different number and are very confused - they send a picture of their contact for me which is correct - we scratch our heads - had I sent a picture of the screen instead of just the safety number, nothing would have improved.  **Actual result:** The contact's phone number isn't included in the Android version of the Safety number screen, but is on the desktop version **Expected result:** The desktop version's inclusion of the contact's number would have enabled me to more easily recognize what was going wrong (and certainly them had i sent a picture of the screen).  ### Screenshots ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119212/166612894-bed836e6-dfe7-4e79-9ffe-caaaef13442d.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119212/166613018-eee43a4e-30fa-4751-9fee-a49363db3f5d.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.36.3  ### Link to debug log  I think this is the bits for the Desktop version https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/blob/f80b3b22e8e4e1d46280a2f769ad7b2276547fbd/_locales/en/messages.json#L530  ```json   ""verifyHelp"": {     ""message"": ""To verify the security of your end-to-end encryption with $name$, compare the numbers above with their device."",     ""placeholders"": {       ""name"": {         ""content"": ""$1"",         ""example"": ""John""       }     }   }, ```  There isn't any particular indication that `$name$` would include a phone number, but it appears to (version 5.41.0 running on macOS Big Sur / amd64)  I think this is the corresponding Android code: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/5d5063ef5f371bc201f11a5e4522bf7fd3090f32/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L2159","open","","jsoref","2022-05-04T01:59:37Z","2022-07-03T02:21:09Z"

From #10951 I've learned that I can start the app, when I set the phone to airplane mode. Then, I can also *see* the debug logs, but I can't submit them, because I would need internet access for that. Connecting the phone to the internet again, directly crashes the app again.  ### Steps to reproduce - I just start the app. - Unfortunately I have no clue what previous actions could have caused this issue.  **Actual result:** App crashes with ""java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Must provide a UUID for E164!"" **Expected result:** App should start without crash.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 6 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.27.13  ### Link to debug log Unfortunately, I don't know how to provide the debug logs, but I can see them, so I can at least retype some things, I see there:  `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Must provide a UUID for E164!` `at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.RecipientDatabase.getAndPossiblyMerge(RecipientDatabase.java:437)`","closed","","KommX","2021-12-06T08:26:12Z","2021-12-09T06:58:06Z"

If the mp4 is directly from giphy, then the user should maybe have the possibility to post an mp4 similarly with auto-play?

If I try to delete the messages in the process of sending, the app stalls. I figured this was related to the large amount of media on my Signal account (~3.8GB), so I exported it all and backed it up. My storage is now listed as ""0 B"", and when I try to generate a backup, the messages count up to ~11000 and then displays a message ""Last backup: Never."" It also fails to generate a backup file under /Signal/Backups. I've reset storage permissions multiple times then re-started this backup to no avail. I later retried this with the beta version 5.22.3 only to receive the same result. Android OS constantly prompts me that ""Signal isn't responding"", with an option to terminate the program.  Even creating a bug report is futile, it simply stalls. At this point I just want to find a way to get my chats exported off this app. Please advise if you have any idea of what is going on. It feels as though all functionality of the app has broken completely.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use 5.21.6 or beta 5.22.3 - Have a chat archive from 3-4GB large - Try creating an export  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy A20 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.21.6 and 5.22.3  ### Link to debug log Cannot produce debug log.","closed","wontfix,","crudlover","2021-08-30T20:16:10Z","2022-02-21T15:09:26Z"

They expect the messages to still exist, only with some ""missing media file"" icon. Mabe it would even make sense to replace ""media only"" messages with that same icon.

Which works fine for giphy. But giphy requires not only an account, but a special approved account. Which of course makes it completely useless for sending your own self-made ones, as it leaks all private information to that dubious third-party site.  So naturally, one wants to do the most simple, normal thing, and just send that short, (usually audioless and small) mp4 file as a ‚Äúgif‚Äù directly via Signal, without going through any useless centralized privacy-selling (aka ad-based) web site.  But trying to do that always ends up sending a video. Which is not shown directly in the chat. Also, there is no way to decide whether to loop it. Despite there being a button seemingly for it, but that does something else that is literally not possibly in physics (prevent the recipient from watching it more than once).  But when I choose to save a ‚Äúgif‚Äù that I received and that *is* shown right in the chat window, it ends up as a short, audioless MP4 file in my file system too!     So it clearly is already designed to do that. The code path to do it when picking one‚Äôs own gif-like video is just currently inconsistent with the code path for giphy-originating gif-like videos.  ### Steps to reproduce - Get somebody to send you a giphy. It should just show in your chat, and animate by itself. - Save that giphy to your file system. (E.g. your meme collection.) - Send the MP4 that that resulted in back to that user.  **Actual result:** That user gets a video, with a play button, that opens a player. it does not animate in the chat. **Expected result:** It should be exactly as if when you received that same file. Animating in the chat. (Or, alternatively, giphy videos should be treated like normal videos too.

Clicked to enter PIN and app crashed. - App continually crashed from then on when loading, was never able to unlock in this state. - Tried force stopping and reloading app - same issue: app crashes, cannot get into Signal. - Tried clearing cache, force stopping and reloading - same issue: app crashes, cannot get into Signal. - Submitted an app crash debug 2-3x on Saturday, November 27th when prompted. - Noticed that when entering another app that required biometrics to unlock - it fell back to password authentication and gave me no option for fingerprint unlock. - This is when I realized the reason Signal was crashing was because biometrics unlock was unavailable.  This seemed to be the root cause of app crash. - Changed scaling back to defaults, disabled Developer Options, rebooted phone and fingerprint unlock became available again - and Signal was able to be unlocked with no crash.  **Actual result:** Signal crashes when biometrics were set for unlocking the app, but became unavailable in the system. **Expected result:** Signal should fall back to prompting to unlock with PIN.  Other apps fell back to alphanumeric input as authentication, whereas Signal did not handle the scenario and instead continually crashed.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 6 Pro **Android version:** 12 (build SD1A.210817.037), Android Security Update: November 5, 2021 **Signal version:** 5.26.11 **Links regarding issues of fingerprint scanner on Pixel 6:** [0] https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qk7bel/psa_aod_fingerprint_icon_broken_by_animation/ [1] https://www.tomsguide.com/news/google-pixel-6-fingerprint-sensor-can-stop-working-if-you-run-out-of-battery  ### Final Notes Have provided a workaround for Signal crashing, specifically for the Google Pixel 6.  However it seems that the fingerprint security system may have other issues (link [1] above) that may inhibit the fingerprint sensor from working.  If Signal is setup to use biometrics for unlock it seems others may run into this issue but hopefully this is enough information to find how to gracefully handle this situation in Android if and when it occurs again.  ### Link to debug log No debug available, however submitted app crash debug via Android system on the afternoon (US Central Time) of Saturday, November 27th.

The bug appears to be present only when receiving messages, while calls follow phone's notification state as they should. This has serious implications when in meetings or concerts.  ### Steps to reproduce - set all Signal notification options to default - set phone on silent - receive a message  **Actual result:** Besides having Signal set to follow phone's state for notifications, loud notification sound comes trough even when the phone is on silent. **Expected result:** Signal notifications stay silent when the phone is set to silent.  ### Screenshots ![signal-2022-07-22-085854](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46635826/180382174-9ffde564-fab7-4027-95ce-eb5f1e8f7088.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Nokia G21 **Android version:** 11 (4.14.199+ Kernel) **Signal version:** 5.43.7  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.43.7/129656cddf0af8bcdc199f6263286081a8f37548ddba02a2ecc2ed0b86d24c25  Needles to say that I have tried reinstalling the app and cleaning the cache and data.  It seems this problem was introduced when Signal implemented its own notification profiles which somehow messed up simple following of the phone notification settings. The bug has been here for a while, but at this point it started to be really annoying.","open","","skopjanecot","2022-07-22T07:28:06Z","2022-07-25T20:13:41Z"

Most of the time it happens immediately or within 1s. 10% of the time there is a ""loading screen"" displaying something like (*) ""Signal is updating‚Ä¶"" which can be displayed for up to tens of minutes, but which does eventually result in same crash behavior.  The app does not start.  Possibly related to bug reports https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11160, https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10868.  _\* I cannot capture screenshots due to app permissions_  #### Important note: only seeking to create backup  Though it is perhaps outside the scope of this report I nonetheless want to mention that my sole personal goal for my Signal installation on this device is to create a backup prior to factory reset. Although the behavior I am describing is indeed a bug and I hope this report is broadly helpful to many, I am not personally interested in using the continued use of Signal on this device, only the preservation of my correspondences.  Regardless, I am very interested in helping to diagnose this errant behavior, so request freely from me any additional details or tests to perform and expect rapid turn-around from me!  ### Steps to reproduce - Update the app directly from a version circa August 6, 2017, to a version circa January 16, 2021 - Tap the app icon to enter main Activity - Sometimes see app-originated fullscreen loading display with text like ""Signal is updating‚Ä¶"" - Confirm seeing OS-originated modal dialog like ""Signal has crashed. What would you like to do?"" - Tap option like ""Try to re-open"" - Confirm seeing OS-originated modal dialog like ""Signal keeps crashing""  ### Device info **Device:** LG Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.1.0, patchlevel June 5, 2018 **Signal version:** 5.28.10; 5.29.2 beta **Funding status:** Signal Sustainer 1 **Rooted status:** non-rooted **Storage usage by app:** 200MB (approx.)

That way, the receiver would be able to save the file and use it for an import in the contacts app. As is, Signal cannot be used to share contact lists.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung SM-J330F **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.41.11","open","","knarrff","2022-06-30T15:56:12Z","2022-06-30T15:56:12Z"

After the update, Signal can no longer download MMS messages.  It can _send_ MMS messages just fine, and regular SMS messages work normally.  Of note, the message download failure takes about a minute.  Interestingly, in one debug log, the error appears to be a connection timeout, as if Signal is using the wrong address (e.g. APN issue) or port (e.g. HTTP vs HTTPS) to reach the MMS server.  In another debug log, the error is HTTP 404.  In both cases, I am not seeing a message ID specified in the retrieval URL.  Not sure if this is the problem or if it was simply censored for privacy purposes. When individually set as default, both the Samsung factory Messages app and the Textra SMS app can receive new MMS messages without any issues; but I wish to use Signal to have all messages in one place.  I have not tried any other texting apps but would expect them to work similarly.  ### Steps to reproduce - Be running Android 12 using Visible cellular carrier and Signal as default messaging app - Receive an MMS message from anyone, including group texts - Message appears (as a blank photo) but its contents fail to automatically download - Open the Signal app and tap the ""Download MMS"" button on any MMS message that previously failed to download  **Actual result:** The circle spins for about a minute and then stops. **Expected result:** Message contents appear within one second.  ### Screenshots ![signal-2021-12-10-170101](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84245450/145647621-4acfb39c-9d81-42fd-be7d-86671850a4e6.png) ![signal-2021-12-10-170104](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84245450/145647636-9f8d9aab-11aa-4617-89d3-8172521b4292.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G (SM-G998U1) **Android version:** 12 (worked fine on 11) **Signal version:** 5.28.3 - 5.36.3  ### Link to debug log [expired] https://debuglogs.org/ec3a3c2c5b0540da47597d1e18fec9cedce1413cd63f10cfe701b91463fd68c6 [expired] https://debuglogs.org/6c513ac3258682a0e5713578ad3daaf908228dca3862d1e9cd73c412b37adfc2 [expired] https://debuglogs.org/android/5.36.3/34c31cfa4b02379c235e8fe1edda3a034282f8e7eaaa8a42cede67ed64d07299 [7/15/22] https://debuglogs.org/android/5.43.3/e6af98dc3b779e5bcee8bb22f01139be71c40b3e1db2edc5ce5752b9a69dcdb7  ### What I have tried - Updating Signal _(no change)_ - Checking my APN settings _(no change)_ - Performing a Network Reset _(hate those, no change)_ - Switching my default messaging app to Samsung Messages and then back _(Samsung Messages works with new messages, Signal still no change)_ - Switching WiFi calling on, and then back off _(no change either way)_ - Switching Signal's WiFi calling compatibility mode on, and back off _(no change either way)_ - Turning WiFi off, and back on _(no change either way)_ - Ejecting and reinserting the SIM card _(no change)_ - Rebooting _(many times; no change)_ - Installing Textra SMS and trying it as default messaging app _(it can also download MMS messages just fine; Singal still no change)_ - After all is said and done, initiating another MMS message to make sure the issue still persists and isn't just limited to old, previously failed messages _(no change)_  ### What I have not tried - Uninstalling and reinstalling Signal - Factory resetting the phone and reloading everything","open","","Techie007L","2021-12-10T22:09:44Z","2022-07-16T02:58:11Z"

Instead the file is directly opened in an app that cannot read the file. In this groupchat this only the case for messages sent from other Android clients the message send from an Iphone gives the desired result. The document I sent is posible to open on the other phones.  This behavior was reproducible with all members of the group. People with less apps on their phone had a toast message no app to open this file is found. The iphone user had no problems to view the documents.  It is possible to first save the document and then open it with an app to your liking, but not directly from within Signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - Sent pdf in groupchat - Open the document from whitin Signal - The document is opened in an app that cannot read the file.  **Actual result:** The document is opened in an app that cannot read the file. **Expected result:** The app gives a suggestion to open the app with a pdf reader or opens it immeadiately in the app that is chosen as standard.  ### Screenshots Message overview: ![signal-2021-07-20-141453](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76212814/126322182-8265fe3b-fd27-408a-b472-d9c7ae52dd67.jpg) Error toast message from other app after trying to open pdf: ![signal-2021-07-20-141453 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76212814/126322284-45c2e6ee-afbc-43dc-a499-78e29f59b3df.jpg)   ### Device info **Device:**  Onplus 3T **Android version:** Lineage OS 18.1 **Signal version:** 5.16.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/ccbc0e12df303cbd26df5c02b09993229b8180c188e72fcd8db1b59e2e293be5","closed","wontfix,","CJam25","2021-07-20T12:22:25Z","2022-02-02T06:09:44Z"

While we can continue our private chat without issue,  he can not receive or send messages in the groups he is in, being informed that he is no longer a member. As a group admin, if I try to re-add him to the group,  I am instead always adding his ""old ID "". However,  this ID seems just to be an artifact local to my device that can not receive any more messages. This also applies to newly created groups!  I have first opened this as a community question [here](https://community.signalusers.org/t/re-registered-with-same-number-can-not-use-groups-any-more/34929) as well, but since it just seems like there are some remnants of the old ID that are not properly updated locally, this appears like a bug to me, especially since everything else is working. Thus, I hope the double post is justified in this case.  ### Steps to reproduce - contact deletes his account - contact re-registers account using the same phone number and PIN - trying to re-add contact to existing or new groups  **Actual result:** Instead of properly re-adding the contact to the group, some dysfunctional remnants of his old account is added. **Expected result:** Adding the contact to the group should replace the old ID with the new, as it works in private chats.   ### Device info  **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 5.15.6  ### Link to debug log [debug log](https://debuglogs.org/32f457308a5e3cb1aadebc715a0b4cb670023acac52809b801726d1cef69d42e)  The important part is probably ""local recipient doesn't match.""","closed","wontfix,","daharn","2021-07-14T07:32:47Z","2022-02-02T01:05:16Z"

We've fixed this by doing a complete uninstall and restore from backup and everything is fine for some time.  But then the app launch instant crash (sometimes you can see the message list screen, sometimes not) returns. Just now I rebooted the phone and without opening Signal, there was an Android popup saying that ""Signal keeps stopping"".  This device was fine up until a few weeks to two months ago.  We thought it might be space related but we've cleared away a ton of space. There is a group in this account between two individuals - one also a Signal user and the other one is not (Apple user in case it matters). We think it might be related to that group but really no evidence other than our other three devices don't have a group like that and have had no issues on those devices (they're also Samsung S20 Ultras in case that matters).  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal Android - See crash - Be very sad  **Actual result:** Instant crashing once it starts this behavior - no apparent way to make it stop. **Expected result:** No insta-crashing.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10+ **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.34.5  ### Link to debug log Can't get to this menu because the app crashes every single time I try to open it.","closed","wontfix,","sanjay","2022-04-07T21:24:17Z","2022-06-26T09:56:13Z"

Then it returns to the start / message page. The other settings-options work alright, signal in general is a bit slow and sometimes crashes, but in no way as consistently. I already cleared cache, cleared google play services cache, restarted phone, checked if version is latest, deleted all data and restored from backup, all makes no change. It is (probably) rather likely that this bug is due to my very old phone/android version (also because i found no other hits for the same problem). but nonetheless it is strange, because signal otherwise works (more or less) fine.  ### Steps to reproduce - start signal - go to settings - tap on ""linked devices""  **Actual result:**  Signal crashes and does not open ""linked devices""-menu. instead after some time it returns to message view or has to be restarted altogether. **Expected result:**  Linked devices menu should be shown so that i be able to scan a QR code and link a device.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung GT-i9195 (don't laugh) **Android version:** 4.4.2 (dito) **Signal version:** 5.42.7  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.42.7/cf78b418b9290b9fd8b75f39d9dbe0a6b7474e1352973832bf3314f1989299c5  I am really not very competent with this android stuff, or rather: not at all.

With this I lost all attachments from before the switch.  ### Steps to reproduce - insert micro SD card into phone - format it as [adoptable storage](https://source.android.com/devices/storage/adoptable) - activate [full-disk encryption (FDE)](https://source.android.com/security/encryption/full-disk) - install Signal (app and its data are automatically stored on the memory card) - use it like this for years without any trouble - in Settings -> Apps, move Signal to the internal storage  **Actual result:** * All attachments sent/received before the switch went missing. Images, videos, files, link previews, both sent and received. In their place, I see the below icon. For images/videos the background behind the icon is a heavily blurred image/thumbnail from the original media. If I try to save such an attachment, I get ‚ÄúError while saving attachment to storage!‚Äù I suspect the data is still there because the storage used by the app is still in the gigabytes. * After the switch, someone sent me a message and it doesn‚Äôt show up on my desktop. Later I sent a message to someone else from my desktop and this message doesn‚Äôt show up on my phone. I *think* it was at this point that I got a ‚ÄúChat session refreshed‚Äù entry in my Note to Self chat (but only on my phone). Since then receiving messages and syncing between the phone and the computer seems to have returned.  **Expected result:** Attachments are still available as before, no messages get dropped.  ### Screenshots ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54036399/153118737-87715942-2879-440a-a2d3-bf76ff76e820.png) ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54036399/153118761-0b77ccaa-5366-488e-b089-dd0ef3a9d6ce.png) ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54036399/153118780-ec8c1f79-aae9-467b-a2d8-e4dbd7e8fc51.png)  ### Device info **Android version:** LineageOS 9.0 **Signal version:** 5.28.10 (website APK)  ### Link to debug log  [Link](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/JWT0EwLJ1XbyAOw-rGfDaHCwXUUX35MQJI-fUnS9AQ8/) (you can turn the preview pane off for more screen space)  The above is an `adb logcat` output in which I open Signal (it was previously forced shut down), unlock it, go into a group chat, open (the black placeholder of) a media attachment and try to save it to my phone‚Äôs storage. I apologize if the log is too heavily redacted, but this is raw adb output so I was careful. I guess the most interesting parts are in the second half, in the lines containing ‚ÄúW AttachmentDatabase‚Äù, ‚ÄúW ZoomingImageView‚Äù and ‚ÄúW SaveAttachmentTask‚Äù.  ### Miscellaneous  Please tell me how do I fix this without losing my chat histories either on my phone or my desktop.  This bug report is a shorter, updated version of my [forum post](https://community.signalusers.org/t/all-attachments-missing-messages-dropped-after-moving-signal-from-sd-card-to-internal-storage/41605).","closed","wontfix,","womanlike","2022-02-09T04:17:47Z","2022-04-21T00:26:01Z"

Today when I booted it up and started Signal, as it was downloading all the older messages, the Android client was spamming me with notifications -- specifically, I got repeat notifications for all reactions that I had received on messages that I sent during the time that the Desktop client was offline. I also had one contact whose safety number had changed during that time and I had *not* re-marked it as verified; in the chat they were part of, I received a series of messages saying first that I had marked their safety number as verified from another device, then that my safety number with them had changed, then that I had marked it as unverified from another device, and finally that my safety number with them had change (again).  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Link a desktop client 2. Exit the desktop client 3. Send messages, receive reactions, have contact change safety number, etc 4. Open chats in which notifications and safety number changes have been received to mark them as read and clear notifications 5. Close Android client 6. Open desktop client  **Actual result:** Notification spam on the Android device and duplicate/unexpected safety number change messages **Expected result:** Nothing visible should happen on the Android device when a linked client is opened after being offline for a while  ### Screenshots ![signal-2021-10-06-205410_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10427164/136309054-27d5fa2a-6449-43c0-be96-8de85f4bf11b.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.24.7.1  ### Link to debug log Android debug log: https://debuglogs.org/f72d0a36b37663475e4dfed3c379113a62786a6d58a5e2b2cc5c5f592bb3b2ae Desktop debug log: https://debuglogs.org/a505342c12eb1647dce8dc8e79c6423c50784df9cf9b68574716a51d985f9eac.gz","open","","Herohtar","2021-10-07T02:07:28Z","2021-10-07T02:07:28Z"

If I unpin the second chat and re-pin it, it is inserted between the second and third chats that were already pinned -- becoming the third chat instead of being appended as the fourth chat. If I instead pin another chat that was *not* previously pinned, it is correctly added to the bottom (fourth position).  If I unpin all but the first chat and attempt to re-pin the others in the original order, the issue still persists and chats are pinned in incorrect positions. The only way to restore the original order is to completely unpin *all* chats and re-pin them in the correct order.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Pin 4 chats 2. Unpin the second chat 3. Re-pin the same chat  **Actual result:** The chat you just re-pinned will become the third chat **Expected result:** The chat you just re-pinned should become the fourth chat  ### Screenshots Not a screenshot, but here's an example:  #### Starting configuration: 1. Chat A 2. Chat B 3. Chat C 4. Chat D  #### Unpin Chat B: 1. Chat A 2. Chat C 3. Chat D  #### Re-pin Chat B (expected result): 1. Chat A 2. Chat C 3. Chat D 4.

Note: I am living in China, using a [China Unicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Unicom) phone number. When I signed up for the first time, Signal wasn't yet blocked. I am using a VPN service from ExpressVPN, the same have been using without issues with Signal since it was put behind the Great Firewall. To confirm this isn't an issue with my phone, I tried to log into Google (which is also blocked in China) from a VPN server I never used before so it would ask to send a verification code. It did and I received it and logged into my Google account without issue. I have never had any similar issues with any other app.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install the app from APK or from the Aurora store (tried both sources); - Tap ""Continue""; - Confirm that the automatically filled out number is correct; - Tap ""OK""; - Tap ""I understand"" (o the missing Google services warning); - Solve captcha; - Repeat two steps before solving captcha; - Wait forever (Optionally) - Tap ""Call me instead"" (once available) - Wait forever  **Actual result:** Verification code is never received and I'm unable to log in **Expected result:** Verification code is received and entering it allows me to log in  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20210823-034107_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40713728/130367956-bc6b96fd-bcfe-47ee-96fc-0cd4268ea019.png) ![Screenshot_20210823-030851_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40713728/130368070-34031ba3-bac8-4b56-920a-0148cda1fcac.png) ![Screenshot_20210823-030900_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40713728/130368105-f7fa4cf3-0fb7-4907-a1a0-48e33b106222.png) ![Screenshot_20210823-030922_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40713728/130368111-ca38a2ea-a252-4d16-b008-7d94ee040789.png) ![Screenshot_20210823-030932_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40713728/130368124-11e3f2d4-3afd-4393-a91e-260599823285.png) ![Screenshot_20210823-031017_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40713728/130368149-e2b1dc79-596d-49e8-ace1-87352408590f.png)    ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 3 **Android version:** 11 (lineage-18.1-20210817-nightly) **Signal version:** 5.20.4  ### Link to debug log [I don't think I can get a Signal log without logging in first, but let me know if I can.]","closed","","ksl1989","2021-08-22T20:00:03Z","2022-02-06T19:20:23Z"

Many of them were simply ""[Name] is on Signal!"" chats with people that I don't actively talk with, but at least one of them was a chat that *did* have some history, but was no longer active, and the last message was a safety number change message from September 2021. There were other archived chats that did *not* become unarchived, so it wasn't an ""all or nothing"" kind of thing. I'm not exactly sure how recently it happened because they were all further down on my chat list and I didn't notice them until I scrolled down looking for something, so I'm not sure if the log will have any useful info. I did re-archive the chats before capturing the log, so if the info is there, you might be able to see which chats were affected (not sure if that is tracked in the logs).  I found https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11690, which seems similar, but was apparently only for the desktop client.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Archive chats 2. Wait 3. ??? 4. Profit!  **Actual result:** Maybe your chats will become unarchived? Actually, I don't know what caused this, so I'm not really sure how to reproduce it. **Expected result:** Chats don't become unarchived unless they receive a new message, per design.  ### Screenshots N/A  ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 5 **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** 5.37.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.37.4/bf6fc6c0fcaab1f6b133706f05619e89b057d0885825de4ac31063cb50ea1d93","open","","Herohtar","2022-05-18T14:06:30Z","2022-06-16T12:53:52Z"

Signal used 2.5GB of mobile data, without any apparent reason for it.  I found a [reddit user with the same complaint](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/okr8b5/how_did_signal_waste_my_entire_data_in_just_1_day/), but nothing in the support forums or github issues.  Unfortunately I don't have a way to reproduce the issue. I did leave the phone overnight charging and with wifi turned off (and mobile data turned on), and got the data usage warning from my provider at 08:06 (25.07.2021), so I expect that the excess data usage was shortly before that. I did not receive any message during this night, so I'm quite confused as to how this could have happened.

This used to work, but now I cannot even open Signal anymore on my phone after attempting it today. (After latest CalyxOS and Signal updates; version numbers given below.)   For the record, I only use MMS with my family; most of my friends use Signal, so this has never something I've tried until recently. SMS works totally fine with photos/etc.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Have an MMS group text and a Signal group text ready in the app. - Take an image from the Signal group text and forward it to the MMS group text - The app will flash/flicker a few times potentially before saying it failed. While this is happening, try to delete the MMS message that has the photo. This will be to attempt to stop it from flickering. - The app will crash. - Go to Settings and Force Stop the app. Clear cache.  - Try again; this might allow you to have the app open for a few seconds before it will fail. - Restart phone and try to open app. - App will open for a few more seconds, but then crash again.  **Actual result:** Completely crashed app; unable to open for more than a few seconds at a time before it crashes again. **Expected result:** I expect the MMS message to be able to send the photo. Absent that, I expect it to gracefully handle a failed attempt and allow me to delete it, so I can view the MMS message without seeing failed messages in the thread.  ### Screenshots I cannot open the app to take screenshots. üòø   ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 3a **Android version:** 12 / **CalyxOS Version**: 3.4.0 **Signal version:** 5.34.10  ### Link to debug log I can't really open Signal right now to grab that. üòÖ","closed","wontfix,","ej-mitchell","2022-04-09T15:58:59Z","2022-07-03T10:47:45Z"

However, when I look at the chat, I could not send a Signal message only text messages. So, I refreshed my contact list in which there was no sign of the person in blue and the person came back and I received the notification again. Thus, now going back to my conversation I tried to change from text to Signal and succeeded however after some time it became back grey. Thus, now I wondering is the person back on Signal or is the person due to long inactivity removed from Signal and unreachable, but is this wrong processed?   ### Steps to reproduce - Have a contact that has probably did not use Signal for a long time. - Receive a notification he is available on Signal - Don't have the possibility to send Signal messages - Refresh your contact list - Get the notification - After some time, the ability to send Signal messages disappears (couple of seconds)  **Actual result:** Notification person is reachable via Signal. You now can send Signal messages but after a couple seconds this ability disappears and only text messages are possible. The person is also not show in the contact page anymore. **Expected result:** Get a notification the person is available on Signal and be able to send Signal messages or get a notification the person is not reachable anymore via Signal and is than shown or not in the contact list in blue respectively.  ### Screenshots In this case I the send button was still blue. You can also see by refreshing the notification comes back, what you don't expect if the person was already reachable thus he was not reachable before.

This issue intends to address the accessibility issue.  After suffering a serious traumatic brain injury (TBI) a handful of years ago, I have had significantly reduced cognitive capacity. Any kind of cognitive load is a strain, and I have a very limited daily ""budget"". This means I am virtually completely socially isolated, with seeing other people roughly 10 minutes a week on average. Signal is my only lifeline to friends and family. Fortunately, because of the head injury, I have had much sympathy and luck in converting my friends to Signal users, and literally everyone I know except my grandmother is on Signal. Needless to say, this small sliver of ""social"" contact is paramount to me in an already extremely poor quality of life.  However, after the color changes, I am literally unable to use Signal. One important aspect of my brain injury is that well-trained tasks are easier on my head. Having used Signal since it was renamed Signal, the existing color patterns and color identities were well established. I tried adapting after the change, but my brain working excessively to make sense of the changes wore me out in seconds. Extra cognitive load that is unnoticeable to healthy people is detrimental and very painful to me.  I have tried setting my color to the old contact colors, and I even tried switching my monitors to monochrome, but to no avail. Signal is unusable to me now.  I beg you. I have been completely out of touch from friends and family since this change made its way to my computer, and I'm not sure how longer I can hang on.  *Please* change the colors back, or add an option to do so.  ### Steps to reproduce - Get head injury - Be isolated from friends and family - Rely on Signal for communication - Get completely isolated by Signal color change  **Actual result:** Unable to use Signal due to color changes. **Expected result:** Can happily use Signal because of old color scheme.  ### Device info **Device:** PC **Signal version:** Latest","closed","","lstor","2021-06-16T00:52:30Z","2021-07-01T03:01:14Z"

"","11753","Corrupted message from a user broke Signal for everyone on the chat group!","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Around 6AM IST (00:30 UTC) on 8th Nov, there was an error message on one of our chat groups which has 94 members. The error message kept flooding the group and every time we open the mobile app, there would be a few more of the same error. Refer Image 1.  The same error came as DM from the user to each of us as well.   After some time we realized that Signal Desktop broke as well, and was showing up as 'Not connected' for some time. After restarting the application on the desktop, it got stuck on ""Loading messages"" which is painfully slow (10 messages every few minutes), it has done around 20000 messages in 2 days and is still going on. Refer Image 2.  I took a debug log from the desktop app and it ran into 1.3M lines and 220MB in size. Filtering for errors, it seems it all started at the time I mentioned above. Refer Image 3.   If I filter for Errors in the log, it is a repeat of the same messages over and over. Refer Image 4. Looks like encryption/decryption got bugged somewhere and now Signal is broken for all 94 of us!!!   None of us can receive any messages from anyone, including in other chat groups or DMs. If we send messages, it goes through, but shows as pending on our mobile apps.   Breaking Signal for everyone else should not be as easy as this üò¢     ### Steps to reproduce - Open mobile app - Send message - Alternatively open Desktop app  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) Mobile App - Shows as pending, but goes through to people not on the specific group. - Those 94 people cannot receive any messages.  Desktop App - It stays stuck on Loading messages and that is too slow to inspire confidence that it will complete any time soon, or that there will be any improvement.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) - Signal should start working despite error messages like these and should not break for everyone on a chat group.  ### Screenshots Image 1: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11489601/141168677-2ae3be69-1282-4e1f-8834-9ad1c270f97e.png)  Image 2: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11489601/141169182-28050cf6-4327-4e7a-b408-beef6ca8720a.png)  Image 3: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11489601/141169389-29967f17-d5cc-4488-bb66-6180a3f86fc7.png)  Image 4: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11489601/141169791-e84f7151-45f4-48b3-a0a5-d649e871c379.png)   ### Device info Device info: samsung SM-M515F (m51nsxx) Android version: 11 (M515FXXS3CUI1, RP1A.200720.012.M515FXXS3CUI1) Signal version: 5.25.7 Signal package: org.thoughtcrime.securesms (doDiFGKPO1r) Registration lock: true Locale: en_GB  ### Link to debug log Desktop app: https://debuglogs.org/8e8c658c67727eca6dd8d12b9299344a3f5b774188a6a749473160261d9033ea.gz   Mobile app: https://debuglogs.org/71dbbcebe91e8517faaec41119ae96b4916eabf86e1b7eaa653580c5272d716e","closed","","rahulraj80","2021-11-10T18:29:15Z","2021-11-11T03:28:01Z"

Strangely, some initial messages (first ones sent after setup) do appear. On a synced signal desktop all messages do 'stay'.  This started to happen after upgrading to v5.23.8, but even downgrading to v5.20.3 kept the same behavior.  Clearing all signal data (effectively a re-install) full re-install of the app, and even a full factory reset (including storage) did not resolve the issue.  ### Steps to reproduce - install signal - set dark theme and 'disable' pin - restart signal (force-kill, reboot, etc)  ** Actual result. ** theme is white again, pin entry is asked again, message history is gone  **Expected result:** signal remembers everything  ### Screenshots N/A  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (n7100) **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 5.23.8  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1dfb1e10ba0c3de47daf7f81dc89053d89e363f3c3c6e7ad28c118f9b83a5198      The log is logcat from when the application would start  ```log 09-22 14:17:18.827  2905  4901 I ActivityManager: START u0 {act=android.intent.action.MAIN cat=[android.intent.category.LAUNCHER] flg=0x10200000 cmp=org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity bnds=[432,1134][566,1286] (has extras)} from uid 10030 on display 0 09-22 14:17:18.863  2905  3146 I ActivityManager: Start proc 4966:org.thoughtcrime.securesms/u0a74 for activity org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: setLatestEventInfo() is deprecated and you should feel deprecated. 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: java.lang.Throwable 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: 	at android.app.Notification.setLatestEventInfo(Notification.java:2084) 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: 	at com.android.server.am.ActivityManagerService$MainHandler.handleMessage(ActivityManagerService.java:2364) 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: 	at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102) 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: 	at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154) 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: 	at android.os.HandlerThread.run(HandlerThread.java:61) 09-22 14:17:18.934  2905  2930 E Notification: 	at com.android.server.ServiceThread.run(ServiceThread.java:46) 09-22 14:17:18.938  2905  2905 D ZenLog  : intercepted: 0|android|17039402|null|1000,alarmsOnly 09-22 14:17:18.940  2905  2905 V NotificationService: pkg=android canInterrupt=false intercept=true 09-22 14:17:19.018  4966  4966 I MultiDex: VM with version 2.1.0 has multidex support 09-22 14:17:19.018  4966  4966 I MultiDex: Installing application 09-22 14:17:19.018  4966  4966 I MultiDex: VM has multidex support, MultiDex support library is disabled. 09-22 14:17:19.021  4966  4983 D libEGL  : loaded /system/lib/egl/libEGL_mali.so 09-22 14:17:19.051  4966  4983 D libEGL  : loaded /system/lib/egl/libGLESv1_CM_mali.so 09-22 14:17:19.061  4966  4966 I FirebaseApp: Device unlocked: initializing all Firebase APIs for app [DEFAULT] 09-22 14:17:19.091  4966  4966 I FirebaseInitProvider: FirebaseApp initialization successful 09-22 14:17:19.106  4966  4983 D libEGL  : loaded /system/lib/egl/libGLESv2_mali.so 09-22 14:17:19.129  4966  4966 I BlobContentProvider: onCreate() 09-22 14:17:19.130  4966  4966 I PartProvider: onCreate() 09-22 14:17:19.176  4966  4966 I ApplicationContext: Installed AesGcmProvider: 1 09-22 14:17:19.441  4966  4966 V NativeCrypto: Registering org/conscrypt/NativeCrypto's 284 native methods... 09-22 14:17:19.455  4966  4966 I ApplicationContext: Installed Conscrypt provider: 2 09-22 14:17:19.540  4966  4966 I ApplicationContext: onCreate() 09-22 14:17:19.547  4966  4995 I SQLiteConnection: Database keying operation returned:0 09-22 14:17:19.608  4966  4995 I SQLiteConnection: Database keying operation returned:0 09-22 14:17:19.634  4966  4995 I SQLiteConnection: Database keying operation returned:0 09-22 14:17:19.684  4966  4966 D ApplicationMigrations: Not an update.

The only thing that fixes it is a Force Stop, but the issue returns after a couple of days. The attached screenshot and debug log were taken at the time this issue was present.   Could this be related to [Issue #9220](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9220) for which there has been a pull request for some time now? If so, what is stopping it from being merged? I would be happy to contribute.   ### Steps to reproduce - Use Signal on a device without Google Play Services for a couple of days (possibly open ConversationActivity repeatedly to cause a memory leak as described in linked issue)  **Actual result:** Application becomes unresponsive and janky when opening the conversation list and individual conversations.   **Expected result:** Application stays as responsive and smooth as the first time it was started after installation or a Force Stop.   ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20211107-001353](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35954251/140639739-38a891ba-08da-4208-adef-b9e01f1578f9.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 4a 5G **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.25.7 **Other info:** CalyxOS without Google Play Services  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/116e5b8e7b65938c641a5bbddad71924e35fcb4b4e8ec8f62094c61c1522966c","closed","","davidtakac","2021-11-07T09:38:56Z","2021-11-15T21:07:05Z"

A message pops up that says a failure has occured. After it has done so, it will still run in background, but when i try to enter the program again, i can't. It will usually fail again. - This whole process happens OFTEN, but NOT EVERYTIME. - I can then close the program (that was still running in background) manually. I then usually wait a few seconds for my phone to process it and then try to open it again. Sometimes it fails again and i repeat the process, but often after one, two or three iterations, Signal actually opens normally and works just fine.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start Signal  **Actual result:** Signal closes itself **Expected result:** Signal should not close itself and remain in the starting screen   ### Device info  **Device:** OUKITEL C3 **Android version:** 6.0 (1470125231, OUKITEL-C3-V2.7-20160802) **Signal version:** Signal 5.14.5 (866, 86601) (1c80e65)   ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/d50ff8965df134dc2162afc6c0b3130c7a0197a85c87a4ee1d391eab3ef1eb88  The debuglog was taken immediately after one of the crashes (today 30.06.2021 roughly 8:30 or something.)  If this has something to do with the old android version ... unfortunately my manufacturer doesn't support update to a newer version. I will have to buy myself a new phone for other reasons this year, but alas it will have to do its job for at least another 5 months or so, so yeah maybe this report helps in doing that and maybe it also helps others with such an old device.

Just call the person!  ### Steps to reproduce - open chat on signal with someone who doesn't have signal - press call  **Actual result:** I get a popup that can't be disabled and agreeing to the popup does not call the person, only auto fills the phone app **Expected result:** Ability to disable future popups and the actual call starting rather than requiring more user input.  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20220328-172007__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/160489815-43c4e0e6-f6cd-404d-a22f-f06d979d40d7.jpg) ![Screenshot_20220328-172112__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21298211/160489817-97946498-b122-4f3f-a359-b78cda4c93ce.jpg)   ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus 6T **Android version:** 12 **Signal version:** Latest","closed","","elibroftw","2022-03-28T21:19:59Z","2022-04-11T18:17:14Z"

My bug might be similar to this one https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11639 But I'm not aware that there was any rotation of the phone prior to this behaviour in my case. So I think my bug might be a slighly different case.  Then there's also this bug https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11367 But again, it's slighly different in my case. The video does not change, it stays like this for the duration of the call.  ### Steps to reproduce  - call someone or receive a call   - the setup was always this one: I was using the desktop app on Linux, the other person was using the Android app   - I used various webcams, e.g. Logitech C980 StreamCam, or an integrated webcam on a ThinkPad T470 laptop   - I did not have the camera rotated, it simply sat on my monitor like it always does and no one sees me rotated when I use a different app like Telegram, Webex, ...  **Actual result:**  My video is rotated, this is how it looked like to the other person on the call. Notice that her phone is not in a landscape mode.  ![2022-03-21_20-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24702416/159349498-776ac31e-c14d-4a4d-a980-82f8ce80b993.png)  But before I started the call, I could see myself ""normally"", that is I was not rotated:  ![2022-03-21_20-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24702416/159350420-cc6c1808-eb81-404d-ba2a-92c91731f114.png)  **Expected result:**  Signal does not rotate my video.  ### Device info  **Linux desktop app:**  **Device:** ThinkPad T470 **Linux info:** Linux base 5.16.14-artix1-1 **Signal version:** 5.35.0-1  **Android app:**  **Device:** Redmi Note 9 Pro **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.32.15","open","","pavelsaman","2022-03-21T19:50:56Z","2022-06-14T19:04:37Z"

This is also noted in `5.40.4.1` as well  ### Steps to reproduce  - Find an item you want to share to Signal's Notes to Self, e.g. a website link from Firefox or a tweet content from Fritter - Select the ""share"" option from the relevant program - Android shows a list of apps you can share with,  select Signal - Signal shows a list of your contacts with the recent active chats grouped at the top  **Actual result:**   From the steps above, you now need to manually search for `Notes to Self` as it is not grouped with the recent chats even when it has been recently used  **Expected result:**   At the final step above, the `Notes to self` should show up as recently used chat and can touched to select and quickly send what you want to share    ### Screenshots  N/A  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S9 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.40.4.1","closed","","grrrrr","2022-06-21T14:41:06Z","2022-06-27T22:14:49Z"

I received a text message with an postal address or login credentials in it. This text (no url) i want to copy to use it inside some other apps. (lets say google maps or password manager or browser login page or some other apps or ...). Some time ago it was easily possible to copy text from received message by long pressing on the text and select the text to copy with the boundary markers. Afterwards the selected text was copied to the clipboard and could be used inside other apps.  With current versions of Signal it is not possible anymore to select text from message - it is only possible to answer/forward/copy an entire message within signal.  ### Steps to reproduce  - select a message with text in it e.g. ""lets meet at Osteria San Marino. We will meet Adam and Eve there too. And remember to bring all the other suff we need and blah blub yummy yadda other long text here..."" - long press on ""Marino"" to select text ""Osteria San Marino"" - Text is not selected, only entire message can be answered and so on... This is not helpful when putting text into other apps input fields...  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Long pressing text of a message selects the entire message and action possible on full message only.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  after a long press (or some similar self-explaining action) it is possible to select single words from an long message and copy them to use in other apps.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** 11 (LineageOS 18.1) **Signal version:** 5.32.7  ### Link to debug log  Not relevant","closed","","sseide","2022-02-22T11:13:28Z","2022-08-02T14:54:58Z"

This is then not cleared on subsequent restore attempts, meaning that that space will never(?) be reclaimed.  ### Steps to reproduce  1. Clear the app's data 2. Find some way to cause Signal backup restores to crash midway through (e.g. #8355) 3. Run the restore (i.e. tap ""Transfer or restore account"", then ""Restore from backup"", then find your crash-causing backup file, then tap ""Restore backup"") 4. Wait until the app crashes 5. Repeat a few more times 6. Check how much storage Signal is using in Settings  **Actual result:** the amount of storage used is several times the size of the backup being restored **Expected result:** the app should be using at most the amount of storage that the backup took up, or even better 0 bytes  ### Screenshots  N/A  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a XL **Android version:** LineageOS July 24, 2021, based on Android 11 **Signal version:** 5.18.3 beta  ### Link to debug log  Will upload a debug log as soon as I'm in front of a real computer.","closed","wontfix,","strugee","2021-07-26T22:50:01Z","2022-04-12T14:58:12Z"

Device pairing seems to work fine. The pairing code is identical and the transfer could start. But as soon as a progress indicator should appear, the transfer fails. I'm even seeing ""0.1%"" for split second.  ### Steps to reproduce - follow instructions on how to transfer data in Signals knowledge base  - I enabled wifi, Bluetooth, location.  - both devices have been restarted - both devices received new wifi direct identifiers.   ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20220309-183352](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/206281/157498295-5582086d-207f-454f-b612-1f66fdb5602e.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 1 and Google Pixel 4a **Android version:** 10 and 12 **Signal version:** 5.33.1 and 5.33.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/android/5.33.1/e43db0f05582bb1608393adb11a482e173e3e20d2c7bfa54d2faf5923885f3df","closed","","jnns","2022-03-09T17:28:12Z","2022-03-14T14:34:40Z"

Name if fictitious in this example).  Note that this flag (and all flags, actually) is actually a two-part unicode glyph, which is `üá®` and `üá≥` one after the other.  ### Steps to reproduce - Name a contact with a second name starting with a flag emoji, or another emoji which is multiple characters. - Click new message.  Make sure you pick a contact with no _actual_ profile picture.  **Actual result:** Signal renders profile pictures for contacts based on the first letter of their first and last name, which in this case, should be considered `Büá®üáø`.  **Expected result:** It seems signal doesn't parse unicode correctly somehow, but the contact's profile pic actually contains `Büá®`, which is incorrect (and confusing).   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 9 **Android version:** LineageOS 18 **Signal version:** 5.35.3","closed","acknowledged,","WhyNotHugo","2022-04-29T11:59:08Z","2022-05-19T07:01:11Z"

I can receive messages from him when he texts me individually, but not when he sends messages to a group. The group in question is a New Group. We haven't tried this in any other groups. He can receive my messages in the group, and I can receive everyone else's messages. On my phone, a little while after he sends a message, I get a notification that a message from him was not delivered. I also have the Signal app on my computer, and I can see his messages in the group just fine on my computer.  I tried clearing Signal's cache on my phone and resetting the encryption session with this contact. After resetting the session, I verified our safety number.  I have looked at Signal on his phone, and the messages to me are listed only as ""sent"" (with one outlined checkmark).  ### Steps to reproduce - ask him to send me a message - look for it on my phone - look for it on my computer  **Actual result:** The message only appears on my computer, not my phone. After some time my phone says ""A message from XYZ couldn't be delivered."" **Expected result:** The message appears on my phone and my computer.  ### Screenshots  How messages appear on my computer: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7763597/137372802-83f6eb65-0e30-4d96-ac57-7598a2cbdeb4.png)  On my phone: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7763597/137372850-b038b375-a5d7-4fde-bd64-a0f4e7d81026.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 6 **Android version:** OxygenOS 11.1.1.1 **Signal version:** 5.24.14 installed from Google Play  ### Link to debug log  This log was taken from my phone right after he tried to send me a message in the group.  https://debuglogs.org/b30d447c5973510c1f6747d9d47ac0f49628d82832295408953e5b8b3063b720","closed","wontfix,","190n","2021-10-14T18:15:06Z","2022-02-01T23:32:16Z"

See https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/8c9eb880cf9cd9c5cac0364f4f0ff47702fca091/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/recipients/ui/bottomsheet/RecipientBottomSheetDialogFragment.java#L181 and https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/8c9eb880cf9cd9c5cac0364f4f0ff47702fca091/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/settings/conversation/preferences/BioTextPreference.kt#L99 for the actual code involved.  ### Steps to reproduce  - select a contact to pull up their ""bottom sheet"" information - long-press on their phone number until the `RecipientBottomSheet_copied_to_clipboard` (""Copied to clipboard"") toast appears - Paste into, e.g., termux `od -ha` to see the additional codepoints in UTF-8.  **Actual result:**  The phone number copied begins with `\xe2\x81\xa8` (`FIRST STRONG ISOLATE`) and ends with `\xe2\x81\xa9` (`POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE`).  **Expected result:**  The formatting control codes are not part of the phone number and should not be copied.  ### Device info **Device:** LG V20 (h990ds) **Android version:** LineageOS 17.1 (Android 10), build from March 14, 2021. **Signal version:** 5.23.8","closed","","nwf","2021-09-19T15:21:51Z","2022-03-29T18:05:03Z"

I am going to talk about the ""chat colour"", which is the setting of the same name in ""conversation settings"".  These circles used to be colourful: they were coloured according to the chat colour,  Now they are off-white with letters coloured according to the chat colur.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open the main conversations front page  **Actual result:**  The circle to the left of each contact name is an off-white colour, with coloured letters in.  **Expected result:**  The circle to the left of each contact name is a circle filled in with the chat colour.  The initials of the contact are displayed in a contrasting colour.  ### Discussion ###  The new display is a serious useability regression.  The colours were instantly visible.  Now they are hard to spot.  I suspect that this change is a side-effect of the support for profile pics; after the update my Signal offered to set a profile pic.  Also, I am concerned that if other users set profile pics, I will not be able to suppress their display.  I want to control what I see on my screen, so I would want Signal to never do that.  The settings has a ""Use address book photos"" option but AFAICT nothing to turn off display of profile pictures.  ### Screenshots  Unfortunately the main chat screen contains sensitive information which I do not want to share.  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 5.18.5  ### Link to debug log  I doubt the debug log is needed.

""Message could not be sent. Check your connection and try again"". Connection and network coverage is OK. SMS via WiFi is turned off. Sending SMS via SIM2 (same provider) still works. Receiving SMS works fine either. The workaround to get it back working is to reboot the phone. Switching back to the built-in SMS functionality is another workaround, but I prefer to use Signal for SMS.  New SIM card, flight mode toggle and forcing app to stop, do not work as a solution. I'm experiencing this problem for 6 weeks now, since I switched phones. My previous phone (Huawei P10) didn't have the problem with the same SIM cards.

The video preview opens. - Use the slider at the top of the screen to trim out the first 10 seconds of the video. - Send the video.  **Actual result:** On the sender's phone, the video thumbnail is a image taken from the first 10 seconds of the video. As a user, I am afraid that the recipient is seeing an image from the video I didn't want him/her to see. In reality though, the recipient sees a different thumbnail, one that actually matches the part of the video that was sent, so there is no ""breach of privacy"", but the UI is misleading.  **Expected result:** On the sender's phone, the video thumbnail should be an image taken from whatever part of the video that was actually sent to the recipient. Ideally, the sender and the recipient should just see the same thumbnail.  #### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5  **Android version:** Android 11 with LineageOS  **Signal version:** 5.22.8","closed","wontfix,","righy","2021-09-11T16:37:32Z","2022-02-02T02:05:32Z"

The same happens if a photo is sent as a normal file. Signal detects it is a photo and tampers with it nonetheless.  The current implementation effectively removes a great portion of information from the file. Especially rescaling the photo greatly reduces its filesize, but information is lost. All this might be undesired in many cases and I believe it falls under _existing functionality that does not work as intended_.  In the case of EXIF data there is an argument that it should be removed due to privacy concerns, especially the location tag. I think it is a great feature that Signal is able to filter EXIF, but if it is a desirable feature and not a bug, it should be properly implemented and user-configurable (probably with a separate option for location tag filtering).  In the case of photo downsizing, it is especially dire with photos taken with Signal. Even the saved local copies of the photos cannot be saved in higher quality and do not contain any EXIF data. As was previously mentioned, it is also hard to send previously taken photo in full quality. I think photos shouldn't be tampered with by default at least when sending files via generic file transfer function.  **To recap**, this bug report contains three **related** issues: - Photos, taken via Signal, cannot be saved in full quality and do not contain EXIF data. - Photos, sent via Signal, are downscaled and EXIF-filtered and even in the case of general file transfer, hacks need to be employed to circumvent this feature, effectively making it a bug. - EXIF filtering with its current silent implementation leaves a question whether it is a feature or a bug.","closed","","drws","2021-07-21T12:00:43Z","2021-08-09T14:04:35Z"

While it can't see OneDrive, SMB etc, I noticed it can see my Nextcloud. I can select the folder, but when it tries to create the backup it fails.  ### Steps to reproduce - Select your Nextcloud folder that uses External Storage (in my case SMB) as destination for backups - Try to create backup manually by tapping ""Create backup""  **Actual result:** a .tmp file with size of 0KB gets created on the storage server. Notification of ""Creating Backup"" appears on the phone for a few seconds. The file isn't visible to Nextcloud, I can see it by navigating to that server over SMB (my nextcloud setup uses external SMB storage). Saving to internal Nextcloud storage works! **Expected result:** Full backup file will be generated on the server.  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot 2022-01-24 113356](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3268305/150767219-7921ad1d-4c77-499f-a90e-c405fdd1be01.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Poco X3, MIUI 12.5.4 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.28.10  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1cfcc3394dbc3ecdc12f8fda88946da33e94008f9c29c5e88024b27839e9b942","closed","","dustojnikhummer","2022-01-24T10:40:42Z","2022-02-17T17:35:07Z"

You can otherwise use the app as normal.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use phone normally first thing in the day e.g. listening to a podcast, after the phone has been asleep for at least several hours. Screen can be off, you don't have to open Signal.  **Actual result:** - Realise it's getting awfully warm in your pocket, and the battery is running low. - Check the org.thoughtcrime.securesms process is using 100% CPU. - Force stop and restart Signal. It then operates normally for several hours at least.  **Expected result:** - Signal uses only the expected background CPU.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S9+ **Android version:** 11.0 (LineageOS 18.1) with no Google apps installed. The problem started around the time I upgraded from Android 10 (LineageOS 17.1). This might be a ROM problem (sorry in advance if false alarm!), but no other app behaves this way. **Signal version:** 5.13.8, has happened for that last couple of stable builds. I'm running a self-compiled release build and am happy to compile a debug build if that'd help.  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1e2a8005e077dcd79b3306972a1a431336986bd9645ad817cb2c9e5468501f2c Weird thing is that I am a member of a couple of groups, and it's repeatedly checking the 3 member group to see if a group call is active?

This string will always be ""media"".That's why the message shown to the user is ""Saved to media"".   Instead of returning a value that won't be used later or will be used but without added value, I refactored the method to return a string that can be used to identify the  path of a saved attachment(`contentType:fileName`).  The returned value from ``org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.SaveAttachmentTask#saveAttachment`` will be used then by a helper method that will identify the output path based on `contentType` and `fileName` using the `android.os.Environment` constants  The message looks like below :  ![signal_msg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50799773/144761058-631e74ec-0d2e-41b6-972d-2c1ae111f315.png)  The extension should be also shown.

When phone is on mobile network only, call and video are perfect 2. _When phone has wireless switched on, audio breaks repeatedly, whether you are 10 cm or 10 meters from the router it's occurring_ - Calls saver is off, set to ""never"". 3. _Tested with both 2.4ghz and 5Ghz signals from router, tested various channels on both spectrums, tested also different channel widths, disabled 5ghs as crowded 2.4 ghz channel potential suspect but happened again._ 4. Other voIP apps such as FB Messenger and Telegram never break up audio 5. _Tested to disable mobile network while on wifi (in order to avoid phone jumping connections), still breaking up_ 6. Tested usb-c adaptor to Samsung S8 and then plug Ethernet straight to router, call is perfect 7.

It would be better to have that enhancement on all foldable devices that support Jetpack Window Manager.  This line: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/4e2e525509d05499faf245a31b21926c31959b64/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/WebRtcCallActivity.java#L816 contains the not-good-enough `if` statement, since it checks for state `HALF_OPEN` and a `FoldingFeature` that is  top boundary is the same as its bottom boundary, which is basically looking for a `0px` FoldingFeature that Samsung devices have (even Android's foldable emulators have `1px` height/width `FoldingFeature` by default, so current approach even doesn't work there).  There is a better API to use on Jetpack WindowManager and this is [isSeparating](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/window/layout/FoldingFeature#isSeparating()) that checks that it's a foldable device on `HALF_OPENED` mode and/or if there is a `hinged` device (such as [Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo?activetab=overview)), where its hinge separates the content.  **Fix:** I've replaced the current `if` statement that works just on Samsung devices for a more appropriated one that works on all foldable devices using `isSeparating`. ``` if (foldingFeature.isSeparating()) { ```  **Tested:** Tested that the change work well on physical devices with hinge (Surface Duo v1 and v2), and virtual emulators that mirror other manufacturers devices (such as Samsung foldables).  **Screenshots (Test):**  _Before:_ on Surface Duo, there is no content separation no matter the posture the device uses): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1050785/146243844-d2ccd847-b138-4863-9e45-4427ab3c23a3.png) **Note:** think that there is a physical hinge in the middle, between the screens, that separates the content (the above screenshot it looks like just one continuous display). For reference [this link](https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RE4AX4U?ver=e041&q=90&m=6&h=920&w=1920&b=%23FFFFFFFF&l=f&o=t&aim=true) shows how is the device and the physical hinge that it has.  _After:_ on Samsung devices and other foldable devices the content separation happens in on `HALF_OPENED` posture as wished, and on hinged devices such as Surface Duo, the content is now separated too (and in fact, just when the FoldingFeature is in horizontal orientation because other code that handles that and that has not been modified). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1050785/146244409-515393bc-15e2-4927-b47b-a71980b2be30.png)  Please, let me know if I need to clarify something else.  Thanks, Cesar  **Note:** I work for Microsoft in the Surface Duo Developer Experience team. I can provide support about foldables and dual-screen development if needed too.

Normally I would have asked whether I could help improve that PR instead of making a new one, however I didn't realize that #9774 had already been addressed until after debugging the issue and writing the code. üòÖ Hopefully my PR is ok/helpful! üôèüèª  Previously, when in a WebRTC call and using Talkback, the dailer buttons would read, from right to left: - unlabelled button - (on/off) switch - (on/off) switch - unlabelled button (when showing flip)  ![a phone screenshot of the signal call interface showing an active call 8 seconds in with four buttons along the bottom of the screen: speaker, camera, mute, and end call](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2933589/153127943-468febb6-b275-46f7-b2ce-0351112f59af.png)  now, when in a WebRTC call and using Talkback, with video and audio enabled, the dailer buttons will read (from right to left): - end call button - on unmute switch - on camera switch - flip button  when in a WebRTC call and using Talkback with video off and audio muted, the dailer buttons will read (from right to left): - end call button - off unmute switch - off camera switch - flip button  I had to create a new ""unmute"" string in order to accommodate the way that the button currently works, but hopefully this will be a quick one to translate because the string already exists elsewhere in Signal. :) I think that the double negatives could be a bit tricky and might recommend swapping how the button announces itself, but that seemed like outside the scope of this PR.  I wasn't able to test the speakerphone button in Talkback/it seems to appear somewhat non-deterministically on my phone, but I have a high confidence that that button will work out well? üòÖ üôèüèª  I do think that it would likely be a better user experience if the ""flip"" button read ""flip to front camera"" or ""flip to back camera"" but it looks like getting the camera state into `WebRtcCallView` may be fairly complicated and above my skills at this time. As it seems like this issue has been open for a long time, maybe it's helpful to merge the initial PR, then have someone else follow up later?","closed","","clado","2022-02-09T05:39:46Z","2022-02-12T04:39:04Z"

Origin tracing is supported by prefixing the message with the author's mobile number. Apart from this the message is also prefixed with a counter that tracks the number of times the message is sent across the platform. This helps the end user in taking an informed decision on how viral the message is.   The code is modified to prefix the message body in the following format ""+919xxxxxxxxx (x) :"" Where +919xxxxxxxxx is the mobile number of the author for origin tracing and (x) is the sent counter.  Apart from this the code is also modified to prevent the recipient from forwarding messages that are tagged with #NoForward.

The fallback there is implemented correctly to show ""Unnamed"" in this case, but only if `titleResource` is null. However `titleResource` is initialized to `0` so Android will try to use string resource 0x0 and crash. This PR fixes this by initializing the titleResource to `null` instead.

The `DefaultErrorMapper` tried to parse it as `MismatchedDevices`/`StaleDevices` but for group sends the format is `GroupMismatchedDevices`/`GroupStaleDevices`.  The first commit in this PR fixes that issue, by extending the error mapper.  The second commit reduces the logging output for mismatched/stale devices exceptions, which currently print the whole stack trace. However the stack trace of those exceptions is not really interesting.  The third commit removes an (AFAICS) unnecessary fallback from websocket to socket if there were non-technical errors. Currently when a mismatched/stale devices error is received via websocket, that information is not handled. Instead the same request is sent again via the push service socket. That request returns the same error, which only then gets handled.  ```  com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot deserialize value of type `org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.push.MismatchedDevices` from Array value (token `JsonToken.START_ARRAY`)  at [Source: (String)""[{""uuid"":""c2-uuid-ef"",""devices"":{""missingDevices"":[],""extraDevices"":[2]}}]""; line: 1, column: 1] 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException.from(MismatchedInputException.java:59) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.reportInputMismatch(DeserializationContext.java:1741) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.handleUnexpectedToken(DeserializationContext.java:1515) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.handleUnexpectedToken(DeserializationContext.java:1462) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray(BeanDeserializer.java:638) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer._deserializeOther(BeanDeserializer.java:210) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.deserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:186) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.DefaultDeserializationContext.readRootValue(DefaultDeserializationContext.java:322) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper._readMapAndClose(ObjectMapper.java:4674) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3629) 	at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3597) 	at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.util.JsonUtil.fromJson(JsonUtil.java:54) 	at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.util.JsonUtil.fromJsonResponse(JsonUtil.java:77) 	at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.websocket.DefaultErrorMapper.parseError(DefaultErrorMapper.java:82) 	at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.websocket.DefaultResponseMapper.map(DefaultResponseMapper.java:45) 	at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.websocket.ResponseMapper.map(ResponseMapper.java:21)  ```","closed","","AsamK","2022-01-22T17:20:04Z","2022-01-25T21:19:29Z"

The current implementation in Signal has a bug in the `given name` field that doesn't allow me to input correct Japanese characters because every `afterTextChanged` event _commits_ the alphabet when it is still in the middle of entering a single character. See the screen record if it doesn't make sense for those non-ime users. I believe this bug also affects Chinese and Korean users, and maybe others too.  The solution implemented in this PR is to check if the input mode is already set as expected and leave it intact if it is.  #### Steps to reproduce the bug 0. Have a Signal Android in an Android phone whose setting allows you to input Japanese characters using Qwerty keyboard. 1. Launch Signal 2. Go to Settings 3. Tap your name 4. Tap your name again to see the profile name editor 5. Tap on your first/given name 6. Enter some Japanese characters. Hiragana, Katakana or Kanji using Qwerty keyboard.  ### Screen recordings  In both videos I was entering Japanese characters in _last/family name_ field first, which is working as expected, and then moved on to _given/family name` field which has the bug, in Signal Settings -> [Tap on my name] -> [Tap on my name] -> name editor view.  **bug**  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/148690029-ca53f8df-7edb-4906-b5c1-c3bb46d1614e.mp4  **fixed**  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/148690046-74165eac-dadd-4384-a7b2-926542706ffd.mp4","closed","wontfix,","fumiakiy","2022-01-09T16:14:24Z","2022-03-12T23:11:22Z"

So the collapsed list has 6 entries, but the full list has 6 entries as well. It makes more sense to collapse the list only if two or more entries are hidden.  With this PR:  - up to 6 group members: all members are shown immediately - 7 or more members: show 5 members and allow to expand  I chose the parameters so that the list has a maximum number of 6 entries, as it is now. Alternatively you could of course use parameters 5/4 to limit the number of initially shown members to a maximum of 5 (as it is now as well).","closed","","cascheberg","2021-07-05T08:15:58Z","2021-07-06T14:11:58Z"

Screenshots should be clear enough to tell which ones, but to list: 1. The ""playback"" triangle on a video media is misplaced 2. The arrow on the ""next"" button points to the wrong direction  The first issue is fixed in this PR by forcing the view to be always in LTR mode. This may sound incorrect but it is actually correct, that a media playback indicator should not be mirrored in RTL layout. See the [material design documents](https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements) for the description.  The second issue is fixed in this PR by adding the mirrored version of webp drawables.  ### Screenshots  |Dir|Before|After| |---|---|---| |RTL|![mediapicker-rtl-bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/124365273-e0912f80-dc14-11eb-9b00-3b3eecb078cf.png)|![mediapicker-rtl-fixed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/124365282-e71fa700-dc14-11eb-86c2-7a144a0e1181.png)| |LTR|![mediapicker-ltr-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/124365285-ee46b500-dc14-11eb-820c-ebc016dbbdfa.png)|![mediapicker-ltr-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/124365287-f3a3ff80-dc14-11eb-9bb1-b0eea75850d3.png)|","closed","","fumiakiy","2021-07-03T19:40:42Z","2021-08-23T15:23:55Z"

[Signal iOS removes the padded bytes here](https://github.com/signalapp/SignalCoreKit/blob/bacb5ab174e8638458ab2032a7a472422efdf165/SignalCoreKit/src/Cryptography.swift#L479-L486) and [Signal Desktop does it here](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/blob/1913752fa0a98f4f57d60af9850be0d01dc46044/ts/textsecure/MessageReceiver.ts#L1190-L1201).  Signal-Andorid doesn't do the similar processing, resulting some files of certain length would add some padded trailing bytes when the app downloads the file, as was reported in #11573 . The added test found that it failed at least for files whose size was between 520 and 540. See the screen recordings for how it happens in the app too, as was reported in the aforementioned GH issue.  This PR is to add the similar processing to what iOS and Desktop does to Android, so it ignores the padded bytes in the file if there would be any.  #### Screen Recordings  **Before the fix at [556ca5a5730e57046419fe8805249204c5be237f]**  Note that the size of the file was initially reported as 531B but it becomes 541B after downloading it.  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/134777454-09a704bb-799e-44ec-abe3-a15a1f79ca26.mp4  **After the fix by the PR**  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/134777475-c1d1619e-8358-44f9-a71e-e8bc72c257b9.mp4","closed","","fumiakiy","2021-09-25T16:06:29Z","2021-09-28T13:30:53Z"

Number translation is not translated correctly.  Other app launches default SMS app to type and send message.  Multiple ""PhoneNumberFormatter: Failed to format number."" lines on debug log.  ---------------------------------------- - [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic ----------------------------------------  ### Steps to reproduce - other app has sms button, it's pressed - signal app opens in write SMS window, topic contains number with %2B prefix - when sms sent no response is shown, no warning nor error. ""looks ok to me, was probably sent""  **Actual result:** No SMS was sent.  **Expected result:** SMS was sent to translated number, hard translation of %2B to + sign would be preferred.  ### Screenshots Screenshot of window looks normal with message and it's history. Target phone number is shown with correct number but untranslated prefix in urlencoded format %2B + countrycode + areacode+phone number. This information is stored in signal's history. Multiple messages stored in similar way, but not send.

Message itself is typed in default SMS app. When default SMS is changed to android default ""messages app"", SMS-messages are sent and received as expected. Messages app probably has different way of identifying or translating phone number. Searching bug reports there are more bug relating to ""%2B"" so I would assume fixing this would fix some of them too. Android is stock version without root. Signal app was force killed, rerun and tried to send sms. Then log was collected. Willing to help in debug/troubleshooting as much as able.","open","","attemarkula","2022-03-25T08:41:32Z","2022-07-06T21:29:27Z"

"","11790","Inconsistent messages order (in group chats at least) as Messages inserted into chat based on receiver's clock and not on server's clock or sender's message order","### Bug description Received messages are inserted into the list by receiver's android clock, and not at end or by the server's timeclock, respectively by the message timestamp.  This leads to group chats having different chat histories depending on the clocks of each device of group members.  It also leads to messages sent while being offline being missed in group conversations. Maybe in individual conversations too.  ### Steps to reproduce - Create a group chat with users and devices A, B and C, clocks synchronized fine by NTP (supposing that time is xx:00 at start in description below). - Send messages with enough lines to fill half devices chat screen: message ""1"" from A at :00,  ""2"" from B at :02 and ""3"" from C at :03, then you can send any more number of messages so that 1,2,3,4 are way up in the chat. - Change clock of device A back in time to :00 - Send message ""4"" from B into chat when clock of A reaches :01 - Check result according to Actual/Expected result below - Move clock of device A back to real time (NTP synced), check it's real again. - Check results (they are unchanged)  **Actual result:** On device A, as messages 2 and 3 take full screen, message 4 is invisible and gets unnoticed. Scrolling back shows message 4 inserted quietly and unnoticeably between 1 and 2! The order of messages is incorrectly 1**,4,**2,3 (and 4 is not marked ""unread"" nor scrolled back to display new message. On device B and C, order is correctly 1,2,3,4. Clicking ""i"" on message 4 on device A shows correct sending and receiving times (as timestamped by local device's clock). Message  **Expected result:** Order of messages should be same on all devices: 1,2,3,4. And message 4 should in all caes be marked unread.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.25.8  This could be related with issue https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11494 or explain it too. Not sure, so reporting separately.  P.S.

However, on the initial run of the app, the preference won't be set. This results in the `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` using the current version as the default value.  But this results in the `VersionTracker` code skipping the if-statement block, so it doesn't set the last version code in the SharedPreferences. What results is that we never have a value for the last version code, so `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` always defaults to the current version code, and thus we always skip the if-statement in `VersionTracker.updateLastSeenVersion`.

Our boss is a Signal user on Android. He has the problem that he can't backup his Signal app data to the SD card and despite 128 GB of internal memory,  he no longer has free internal storage, mainly because of the signal backups.  The most reasonable explanation was that his Android version doesn't support file systems other than FAT32 on SD cards.  FAT32 has some limitations, such as a maximum file size of ~4 GB.  His Signal installation uses more than 4 GB.  To us, the use of a sd card for backups also seems advantageous, as it is easier to get at the data if the device breaks down.  We discussed several solutions.  The best solution we came up with, is to just chunk the Signal backup into parts smaller than 4 GB, if desired.  I was tasked to implement it.  To use this code in a real Signal installation, it has to be in the official release.  Now, here is my MR! :-)","open","","Roghetti","2022-01-15T22:25:42Z","2022-07-26T17:00:24Z"
