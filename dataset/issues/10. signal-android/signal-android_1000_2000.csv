Evaluates always to ""false"". This is caused by `sendButton.isManualSelection()`  ```   //sendbutton.java   public boolean isManualSelection() {     return transportOptions.isManualSelection();   }    //transportOptions.java   public boolean isManualSelection() {     return this.selectedOption.isPresent();   }   private Optional selectedOption        = Optional.absent();  ```  Replaced !isSmsForced() with !sendButton.getSelectedTransport().isSms() on the function onTextChanged(String text)  isSmsForced() is used also in: - private void sendSharedContact(List contacts) { - private void sendKeyboardImage(@NonNull Uri uri, @NonNull String contentType, @Nullable KeyboardImageDetails details) { - public void onActivityResult(final int reqCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {  I have not checked the three functions to see whether there could be problems with an incorrect evaluation of isSmsForced(). The condition `sendButton.isManualSelection()` is also used in other places.  ---------------------------  While checking, I came across the question of whether you could do the typing indicator handling without the ""onTypingStopped"". At the receiving end, the display (of the typing indicator) also stops without the typing-stop message.","closed","","Sgn-32","2021-02-17T18:16:36Z","2022-02-06T16:44:10Z"

"","10952","PushMediaConstraints.java: Tweak image dimensions (maximum to 2160 pixels)","This PR tweaks the maximum image dimensions to fall in line with screen resolutions and video standards.  This is not a perfect solution, make image compression slightly less worse than without it.  Recently the maximum image width was reduced from 4096 pixels to 1600 pixels, the same number WhatsApp uses for years. 1600 isn't the most logical number. In this PR I used standard video formats as baseline, which most smartphone displays also use.  The maximum of 2160 is both the vertical resolution of a regular 4K-screen (3840x2160), but also the vertical resolution of a 18:9 1080p display (1080x2160). So it's high enough to share 1080p screenshots, even in the 18:9 ratio.  Another advantage that for pictures in the 3:2 aspect ratio 2160 is perfectly dividable: 2160/3*2 = 1440 pixels on the short side, while 1600 pixels tries to reduce it to 1066.67 pixels, mostly rounded to 1067.  The max resolution is a little higher and so will the file-size be, but that's were the fall-backs are for. These are also adjusted to common screen and video format resolutions.  ------  Talking about fall-backs: Currently the encoder tries (as far as I understand it) to drop resolution when the maximum file size is exceeded. I don't think this would be the best way, I would suggest dropping the quality parameter in the encoder. By default JPEG quality 70 now is used, instead of dropping resolution dropping encoder quality to 60 or 50 should first be tried.  @greyson-signal If you get the chance, please review.  ### Contributor checklist  - [x] I am following the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines) - [ ] I have tested my contribution on these devices:  * Device A, Android X.Y.Z  * Device B, Android Z.Y  * Virtual device W, Android Y.Y.Z - [x] My contribution is fully baked and ready to be merged as is - [ ] I ensure that all the open issues my contribution fixes are mentioned in the commit message of my first commit using the `Fixes #1234` [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)","closed","wontfix,","EwoutH","2021-02-12T09:16:36Z","2022-02-21T06:14:48Z"

You can delete this if not in the proper location.  I searched for all issues, and couldn't find a similar request for this one.  For kids, we usually give them Android tablets / phones without a SIM card. Therefore they don't have a phone number, and they can not receive SMS for confirmation / validation.  I also don't want to use virtual/fake phone numbers.  These devices are connected to internet via WIFI.  Is there a way to support using Signal without a SIM card / phone number ?","closed","","stulluk","2021-01-10T08:14:27Z","2021-01-11T04:40:28Z"

Dorsey and Twitter are antithetical to free speech and privacy. Consider replacing Dorsey with Elon Musk who on January 7th, 2021 tweeted ""Use Signal"" given the direct affronts to free speech occurring on Twitter.  Perhaps the most egregious violation of both free speech and privacy is the TASK platform which a Facebook whistleblower revealed is used at Twitter, Facebook, and Google to, in Mark Zuckerberg's own words, ""share signals"" about users who violate their community rules. The community rules, however, tend to only uphold the right to free speech when it aligns with the ideological echo chamber at Twitter, Facebook, and Google and that has led to dissenting facts and opinions being flagged, ""shared,"" and censored.

Create a video from a number of png's using ffmpeg, command `ffmpeg -framerate 25 -i /dir/frame_%05d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 22 video.mp4`. You can find the video file [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20440137/106349598-62c8a100-62cf-11eb-8638-d56f2be16583.mp4). 2.  Send it to a contact.  When I initially sent that video using Signal Desktop, my contact could view the video (iOS) and had no issues. I could also view it in Signal Desktop. When I try to play the sent video on my phone, the video view opens but nothings plays (but doesn't work via the standard built-in app either). When I save it (from the Signal Android app to my usual storage) and send it to another contact, Signal Android crashes. The same behavior when I try to forward the message I sent earlier.  When that crash happens, Signal Android returns to the list of all chats the first time. The second time I try the OS tells me that the app keeps crashing and any ongoing call at that point stops.  ### Device info  **Device:** Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.2.3  [Debug Log](https://debuglogs.org/5d9e8a6c1b8a7755ee2bc67202bb7106d55d0138aebfcf0ad1ef116a36ace31c)","open","acknowledged,","vandenheuvel","2021-01-30T07:00:47Z","2022-04-11T16:28:43Z"

Like, the texts that you typed freezed until and unless you start from the place where it stopped. In other words, to be more specific, explained in Steps to reproduce section.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start typing to a person - Receiver must be online and should be texting you. - When you're typing, you should his/her message.  - At that instant of time, your typing is interrupted and you're supposed to type again(not from the beginning, but from where it stopped.) - Example text: (under square brackers) [You: Typing... Receiver: Sent you a message. You: Typing interrputed]   **Actual result:** My typing is interrupted. Like if was supposed to write ""Hello"" and I receive the message at the time of typing ""He"" (either by typing letter by letter or glide typing) You're now supposed to click back button and type again. **Expected result:** Even you're typing a message and you recieve a message when typing, your typing must not be interrupted.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Nokia 6.1 Plus* **Android version:** 10.0 **Signal version:** 5.1.1 (latest beta)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1155817aba73adc28848dd0bd51019b97640abfb1628eaea62329d09b2edc9c1","closed","","pixincreate","2021-01-08T13:47:42Z","2021-01-12T03:11:04Z"

The new feature: account transfer to new cell phone has been applied. The notification sound from the old cell phone was also transmitted, but it does not exist on the new cell phone.  Now a visual notification is given on the screen for all incoming messages, but no notification sound.  If an attempt is made to select a sound on the mobile phone, the old notification sound (name) is still displayed after selecting the new tone. If no sound is selected, silent is displayed. If you then select any sound again, the old notification sound will be displayed again and there will be no acoustic notification.  This only works properly if an individual notification sound is selected for a single contact.     ### Steps to reproduce     - Transfer account from one device to another, who has different system sound file names     - Open Singal in new device     - change the notification sound for siganl messages.     - receive a message   ### Device info  Old Device: Samsung Galaxy J5  Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 5.8.10   New Device: Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro  Android version:** 10 QKQ1 MIUI 12.0.2 **Signal version:** 5.8.10","closed","wontfix,","Loopbuilder","2021-05-03T10:32:18Z","2022-02-02T13:08:03Z"

It crashes after pressing `Next` (in French ""Suivant"" on my phone) at the phone number registration phase. I then receive an SMS with a code in it but the app closed at this point. If I relaunch it, it restarts from the beginning of the onboarding. Because of this I am unable to use the app at all.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install app from Google Play - Launch app - Press the button to start on the welcome screen - Press ""next"" on the phone number registration (I'm french so the button says ""Suivant"" for me) - After some loading, the app crashes: ""Signal has stopped"". Reproduces every time.  **Actual result:**  The app stops.  **Expected result:** The app successfully registering my number and not crashing.  ### Screenshots I don't know how to do it, not sure if it's relevant here  ### Device info **Device:** Wiko Birdy **Android version:** 4.4.2 **Signal version:** 5.2.3  ### Link to debug log I cannot use Signal's advanced settings to get a log, because Signal can't even get past the onboarding screens, which have no other menus than the two buttons mentionned in the repro steps. However I found accidentally that if I tap the first screen randomly, it prepares a debug log, so I uploaded it here https://debuglogs.org/889dae9323d8fc7ea0b3777ab2ab22a44070e0838c14a1fb4251b8602a90b613  ``` E/AndroidRuntime(16774): FATAL EXCEPTION: main E/AndroidRuntime(16774): Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 16774 E/AndroidRuntime(16774): android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #114: Error inflating class ImageView E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.createViewFromTag(LayoutInflater.java:713) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:755) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:758) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:758) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.rInflate(LayoutInflater.java:758) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:492) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.inflate(LayoutInflater.java:397) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.registration.fragments.EnterCodeFragment.onCreateView(EnterCodeFragment.java:61) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.Fragment.performCreateView(Fragment.java:2600) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl.moveToState(FragmentManagerImpl.java:881) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl.addAddedFragments(FragmentManagerImpl.java:2100) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl.executeOpsTogether(FragmentManagerImpl.java:1874) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl.removeRedundantOperationsAndExecute(FragmentManagerImpl.java:1830) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl.execPendingActions(FragmentManagerImpl.java:1727) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManagerImpl$2.run(FragmentManagerImpl.java:150) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:808) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:103) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:193) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:5315) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:515) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:825) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:641) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): Caused by: android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: File res/drawable/ic_error_outline_14_ultramarine.xml from drawable resource ID #0x7f080140 E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.content.res.Resources.loadDrawable(Resources.java:2152) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.content.res.TypedArray.getDrawable(TypedArray.java:602) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.View.(View.java:3579) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.widget.ImageView.(ImageView.java:123) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatImageView.(AppCompatImageView.java:74) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatImageView.(AppCompatImageView.java:69) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatViewInflater.createImageView(AppCompatViewInflater.java:199) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatViewInflater.createView(AppCompatViewInflater.java:119) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatDelegateImpl.createView(AppCompatDelegateImpl.java:1551) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatDelegateImpl.onCreateView(AppCompatDelegateImpl.java:1602) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater$FactoryMerger.onCreateView(LayoutInflater.java:172) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.view.LayoutInflater.createViewFromTag(LayoutInflater.java:684) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	... 23 more E/AndroidRuntime(16774): Caused by: org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException: Binary XML file line #1: invalid drawable tag vector E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.createFromXmlInner(Drawable.java:933) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.graphics.drawable.Drawable.createFromXml(Drawable.java:877) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	at android.content.res.Resources.loadDrawable(Resources.java:2148) E/AndroidRuntime(16774): 	... 34 more ```","closed","wontfix,","Zylann","2021-01-26T20:49:45Z","2022-04-12T08:26:40Z"

However, as a side-effect of this new feature, the zoom-values of the internal image-viewer have to been updated accordingly, so that actual advantage of the the higher image resolution really can be seen/observed by end users.  Currently, when sending High-Quality images (LEVEL_3), on small screens (e.g. 4.5""-5"") you even cannot zoom images to the same maximum size as for low-quality images. Without higher maximum-zoom levels, the actual _image-details (image information)_ of high resolution images are _not much visible_ to users when _directly comparing_ it to the same low-resolution version (at least on small screen and having average eyes). During my beta-tests I exactly got such a feedback by some users (normal users, not beta-experts).","closed","","rainerm77","2021-05-23T16:06:53Z","2021-06-23T09:17:50Z"

Similarly when you are sending someone an Image it says ""Message to Alice"" when the user has not entered any text.   This hint text is initially missing when you are sending people image messages.  ### Steps to reproduce - open a conversation - select an image to send someone  - the compose message text box will be empty (since you haven't typed anything yet) but will have no hint. If you focus on this text box by opening the keyboard and then closing the keyboard, the ""Message to Alice"" hint that should have been there in the first place will return.  **Actual result:** Message hint is missing, making it not discernible from the UI who your image will go to. **Expected result:** ""Message to Alice"" message hint should always be there when there is no text present in that text box.  ### Device info  **Signal version:** 5.2.3","open","acknowledged,","bitmold","2021-01-25T16:51:32Z","2022-05-30T18:12:17Z"

"","10374","Allow us to set change default notification settings for groups","I want to be able to set a notification sound for groups. I found this issue raised way back in 2014, and it was suggested that it'd be even better if we could set notifications per conversation/group. This seems to be implemented, but this isn't what I want, as it means every new group I join, I have to go in and change the notification settings manually.  I would like a low priority alert, eg. a short quiet sound and a short vibrate for groups, and a high priority alert; a louder sound and long vibrate if the message is sent directly to me, or if for example I was @mentioned. When people are spamming groups, I know I can safely ignore the alert if I'm busy, but if someone is messaging me personally I know to check my phone.  To get the best of both methods, it'd be great if we had default settings for regular conversations, a separate set of default settings for groups, and then have the ability to mute/change notifications on a per conversation basis.","closed","","gazm2k5","2021-01-08T13:07:48Z","2021-01-08T15:58:45Z"

"","10922","SVG media files hide gallery selection button on Camera view","I stumbled upon this issue and was able to successfully reproduce it after downloading an SVG file as my latest image file. I'm not particularly familiar with Android development and how the ecosystem handles file previews (app-side exposed or os-side exposed), but I'm fairly sure anyone having just downloaded an corrupted file as their latest media file, or more accurately one that's either unsupported by the system or otherwise unpreviewable as a thumbnail, will hit this.  ### Bug description When the user's **latest** media file to be downloaded is an SVG file, the gallery selection button that normally shows a preview of the latest image available turns transparent and is therefore completely indistinguishable from the camera view spanning most of the screen. Thus the user ends up with no visual cues as to whether the ui supports bringing up the gallery and so on.  In contrast to this, the media asset's preview shows up as a blank/black rectangle once you actually get into the gallery selection.  ### Steps to reproduce - Download an SVG file. - Open a Signal Chat. - Click the Camera/Media button in the text input area.  **Actual result:** Notice how there's no Gallery preview ui element on the bottom-left of the display. **Expected result:** Show a corrupted image thumbnail (similar to FB Messenger's), a blank rectangle or even the first valid gallery thumbnail available.  Are SVGs supported by Signal at all? If not, shouldn't the app prevent the user from seeing/selecting them in the gallery app? Unless of course such behaviour differs per platform or os version.  I'm attaching a screenshot comparison between normal and buggy behaviour.  ![compare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1786609/107125585-84b7ba00-68b3-11eb-9020-1095b456c9f1.png)  I was originally going to provide my SVG file, but I tested with a random one off the web and it seemed to also hit this.

It seems to be a commonly acknowledged issue in the dev community, but as someone who knows essentially nothing about Android or mobile development, it took me a few months to figure out why some incoming SMS messages seemed to vanish from the face of the earth. Can we add a dialog box to warn users of this issue when they set Signal as their default SMS app? Signal recognizes when it's the default app, so it should be possible to throw up a dialog box when it detects the transition. Or possibly some other, cleaner, condition.  Example text: ""Users have reported issues receiving text messages caused by Android's battery optimization. Ensure that Signal has the same battery optimization settings as your phone's default messaging app.""","closed","","ttshaw1","2021-03-16T02:54:25Z","2021-03-16T14:41:38Z"

Everytime I click the delete account it shows: 'Failed to delete account. Do you have a network connection ?' message. I used this number in the past for signal which means I installed the app, deleted the account, reinstalled it and tried to delete it again. Second time did not work. I am not sure if the behavior is triggered due to second time trying to delete the account or some other bugs.

If you turn your Phone back and you unlock your Phone Signal shows the Lock-screen. Signal is on this screen stuck. You can not ""Tap To Unlock"", the button is not working. You have to relaunch the App to fix the Issue :-)  *I mean here with Turning of the Phone to just leave it and it's shutting it self off.  ### Steps to reproduce - Go to Signal Settings and turn on the Auto Lock feature 👍  - Add a Time Signal should Lock itself 🕒 - Leave your Phone until it locks itself  - After the Lock Time from Signal is over turn on your Phone again... ...now there should be the Bug at least on Android  **Actual result:** Signal is Stuck on the Screen and you can not lock back in, the Button is not Working... **Expected result:** Press on the Button... and read my Fingerprint     ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 3a **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.9.7","closed","wontfix,","theDeal","2021-05-11T15:55:53Z","2022-02-02T01:05:27Z"
"","11101","Signal-Server code not public since April 22 2020 (Last commit on codebase) ?","https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/commit/3432529f9c018d75774ce89f3207b18051c26fe7 is the last public commit.  Is there any public reason why the server is not open source anymore? Sorry to post here, would have loved to open an issue on the [Signal-Server project](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/), but that is not possible.  Tagging all past official contributors of Signal-Server to get insight publicly: @moxie0 @moxie-signal @TheBlueMatt @geogriff-signal @acton-signal @ehrenkret-signal @noboomu-signal @posix4e @paride @FredericJacobs @mkroman  Libability in open source projects is a thing, even if forgotten. Transparency is the method. Otherwise, it requires faith. And faith is to be replaced by transparency and liability.   Otherwise, i'm sorry guys/gals, but you are pushing people down this graph for decentralization; this graphic took into consideration your server code was open, which it isn't anymore: https://twitter.com/ArndtNissen/status/1354876066691768325  Edit: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server/commit/365ad3a4f821a9e2393c5a3e1522b2c03b9dfe40 updated server code to version in April 2021:  ``` 3.21       ```      Where code is not public anymore. Same stance. Trust is now based on faith, not transparency nor accessible and auditable source code. Please change that; or claim you are now closed source on server side code and that [metadata](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters) collection is whatever people might believe in without possibility of auditing it by themselves.","closed","","tlaurion","2021-03-13T21:02:58Z","2021-04-08T02:31:19Z"

"","10920","Can no longer share over SMS/MMS","Hi,  It seems Signal recently changed its sharing UI to be able to share with multiple people. (Share as in long-pressing a message and pressing the thick right-arrow button.) This has three issues for me:  1. It makes the flow much more cumbersome for the common case of sharing with one. 2. If I share with multiple, it's unclear what the semantics are. Do I open new group chat? Does it duplicate the messages? 3. Most critically, I can't share with anyone not on Signal anymore. People on SMS/MMS are simply gone from the dialog box.  Sharing messages from Signal to SMS/MMS users always had its issues—in particular, images would not get properly transcoded without going in and making a fake edit (e.g. a 1px crop). But taking it out entirely seems a bit odd?","closed","wontfix,","sesse","2021-02-06T16:26:33Z","2022-02-02T13:08:13Z"

"","11196","Calls fail on hotspots that only allow web/mail.","Here in Germany, a popular router is Fritz!Box. It has a hotspot feature that is used by many small businesses (doctor, bicycle shop, etc). That hotspot, by default only allows browsing the web and receiving e-mail and what's necessary to do that. (Like DNS, but only the router's DNS forwarder.)  Unfortunately, this means that Signal calling never connects on many wifi hotspots here in Germany.  But of course it should. Even if abusing port 80 or 443 for something other than HTTP(S) is technically wrong.  I find it surprising, that a security and privacy conscious messenger can be blocked by something that simple. Surely any dictatorship would find it trivial to stop Signal, or at least calls. (I've also read all UDP ports need to be open. … Another thing unlikely in any such situation.)  So the purpose of this bug is to get Signal to work anywhere. Even if just a single port is open and only TCP is allowed. Ideally even in cases where only a whitelist of domains or IP addresses are allowed. (In the long run, I imagine modules for sending messages through various public services and using steganography, e.g. sending data inside images whose encrypted links are posted on Twitter. But that is definitely not part of this bug. :)  I would already be OK with it just working on those Fritz!Box hotspots. (They have great online documentation and support, and are open to concepts like privacy and techie things. So looking up what their firewall lets through, should be trivial. [If necessary, I can do that.])","closed","wontfix,","navid-zamani","2021-04-11T12:43:50Z","2022-02-02T15:36:01Z"

"","11116","Signal doesn't return to the previously opened App, when opened through a notification","Hallo I have created an issue #7362 years ago:  Back-Button doesn't return to previous app, when Signal is opened through a notification and this issue has been closed because of the merge of another seemingly related issue (#7371). But indeed it was not related, the bug is still present: When I am in any app in foreground and a notification about a new message in Signal arrives as notification in the notification bar, then I would not hit it to open that message in Signal because then I won't get back to the previous app with the normal back button. I will land at the home screen.  The previous app could easily be closed in background if I would tap the signal notification, so even if I re-open it with the overview button it is very likely that Android has closed it already and I lost the state of this app, whatever I had done in it.  Some other apps handle it the same way (k9mail, Threema) but the most apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, FairEmail, Conversations etc.) handle it (as I think) correctly, they won't go back to home but to the previously opened app, where the user had been, when opened the signal notification. I opened [an issue for that in k9 years ago](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/963). The main developer at k9mail, cketti, thinks that it were [Android's recommended practice](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html), but this is just an (mis)interpretation, because it is not written like this.  So it would be great if this handling would be fixed and Signal behaves like the most other apps with its notification.  The expected behaviour would be e.g.: I have the Browser open, I read some text. A Signal notification arrives and I have it in the notification bar. I tap it and read the message, maybe I answer it, now I tap the Back-Button. Signal opens the Signal main screen (where all contact's messages are), I hit the Back-Button again, Signal closes and I am back at the very same screen of my browser where I continue to read my text 😄  But at the moment I have to re-open the browser and often the opened website is gone.

Indeed, we use a rather particular telephone system, because although we are all in France, we each have our own international code. France is +33 But Martinique for example (where I am) is +596. However, our French telephone system replaces this international code with a national 0. My number is recorded in signal in international format + 596696xxxxxx And when I receive a call from mainland France, signal transforms the 0 into +596 (which is my own callsign) but which does not necessarily correspond to the number of the person who sent me this message. The sender's number is therefore FALSE. And if I try to answer him, I must have an error. To achieve this, I have to send my message by replacing the +596 with a +33 manually.

This call should ring on the AVD as expected. 3. Press the power button on AVD to push app to background 4. After some time websockets are disconnected (since FCM is enabled). This usually takes ~ 1 min.  **Look out for this log in Console to confirm connections have been torn down:**  > I/ApplicationContext: App is no longer visible. D/WebSocketConnection: Sending keep alive... D/WebSocketConnection: Sending keep alive... W/IncomingMessageObserver: Application level read timeout... D/IncomingMessageObserver: Network: true, Foreground: false, FCM: true, Censored: false, Registered: true, Websocket Registered: true W/IncomingMessageObserver: Shutting down pipe... I/WebSocketConnection: disconnect()     disconnect() I/IncomingMessageObserver: Looping...     Waiting for websocket state change.... D/IncomingMessageObserver: Network: true, Foreground: false, FCM: true, Censored: false, Registered: true, Websocket Registered: true I/WebSocketConnection: onClosing()     onClose() W/ApplicationDependencyPr: onDisconnected() I/WebSocketConnection: onClosing()     onClose() W/ApplicationDependencyPr: onDisconnected()   5. Now immediately make a test call from a phone to AVD. You will see 'Network Failed!'  on your phone 6. Now try to call again. A connection error gets thrown : org.whispersystems.signalservice.api.push.exceptions.PushNetworkException: java.io.IOException: unexpected end of stream on Connection{textsecure-service.whispersystems.org:443, proxy=DIRECT hostAddress=textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/:443 cipherSuite=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 protocol=http/1.1} in RestStrategy -> execute call  The fix was to enable automatic retry in buildOkHttpClient. From what I could find in the code, this call is only made from submitServiceRequest and getServiceConnection. Based on https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html, retries should not be an issue for idempotent verbs.   After my fix, I still get 'Network Failed!' on first call attempt, But the AVD rings on second call attempt","closed","","ascendingSun","2021-01-28T04:10:46Z","2021-03-08T15:23:27Z"

Contact sorting via ORDER BY was previously not requesting case-insensitive sorting, so contacts with lowercase names were appearing at the end of the contact list rather than collated with other contacts starting with the same letter in uppercase.  This fix was tested by first reproducing the issue on a Pixel 2XL running Android 11, changing the order by clause, and then re-installing Signal and refreshing contacts to confirm that a contact with a lowercase name was located with other contacts beginning with the same letter in uppercase rather than at the end of the contacts list","closed","wontfix,","ChewTeaYeah","2021-01-10T15:26:20Z","2022-04-04T18:45:41Z"

Assuming I am browsing a sticker pack with many edgy or NSFW stickers and a single SFW sticker that I would like to send to a group chat, I may accidentally send a sticker unintentionally while browsing. The result is I am afraid to use stickers since it seems too easy to accidentally send the wrong one.  Proposed change: Stickers should highlight on tap (or foreground or be put into the message box) and require a 2nd tap to send. For examples of how this could work see other messaging apps such as Line.","closed","wontfix,","SwartzCr","2021-03-22T05:03:23Z","2022-02-02T17:36:25Z"

They will default to Signal msg.  If someone uninstall Signal after that, you still have the option to send Signal messages, that are now default.  That is very confusing, as people without so much tech knowledge will feel like they cannot send message to a contact anymore.   ### Steps to reproduce - A friend install Signal - Your Signal app now detects it and change the default from SMS to Signal - That friend uninstall Signal - Your Signal app still sends Signal msgs, not going back to default SMS  **Actual result:** You end up sending a Signal message to a contact that does not have Signal anymore, and the message is never received. Your app still thinks the contact have Signal. **Expected result:**  Your app should go back to default that specific contact to SMS, not Signal. When you try to send a Signal msg to a contact that does not have Signal installed, Signal app should detect that and change your message to SMS.  Lost of data is the worst kind of error, and in this case, lost of communication (that may be urgent), until the sender realizes what is happening.   ### Screenshots No screenshots needed for this explanation.  ### Device info No device info needed for this bug.  **Device:** two devices **Android version:** multiple **Signal version:** last for Android from play store (5.5.5)   ### Link to debug log No link debug log generated","closed","","drbeco","2021-04-04T13:50:33Z","2022-08-02T05:15:47Z"

Changes should not affect build output so this was not tested on any device. The reproducible build process was tested on my Mac build machine  Following the reproducible build instructions resulted in the build failing with somewhat cryptic errors :  ``` > Task :Signal-Android:mergePlayProdReleaseNativeLibs  FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.  * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':Signal-Android:processPlayProdReleaseResources'. > Multiple task action failures occurred:    > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.Workers$ActionFacade       > AAPT2 aapt2-4.1.1-6503028-linux Daemon #1: Unexpected error during link, attempting to stop daemon.

On my Mac, Docker was configured by default to use a max of 2GB of runtime memory. Docker on Mac cannot change the runtime memory available via command line. It needs to be set via `Docker Desktop`'s preferences GUI.  I played around with different settings and 8GB seems to be the minimum amount of memory that results in a successful APK build.  Updated build instructions to match.","closed","","folecr","2021-01-15T00:28:17Z","2021-02-25T22:01:53Z"

Unfortunately, it is not available for all Android users, and as the US is known to use [sanctions to wage silent wars](https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-106-the-sanitization-of-sanctions) and [starve civilians](https://thegrayzone.com/?s=sanctions) in order to bully the governments of sovereign nations (often based on unchecked far-right-wing ~""intel""~ propaganda), this can restrict access to the Play Store. While there is a self-updating APK using websockets from #1000, a proper listing in alternative app stores is needed to actually facilitate this properly.   P.S. Unless F-Droid starts appearing preinstalled on devices—which would be cool—this is not a rehash of the duplicates of https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/127#issuecomment-13335689 (#281 #282 #3954 #4429 #4430 #5853 #5995 #6292 #7505 #7988 #8469 #9044 #9966 #3995 #8584), but perhaps the original should remain unlocked  for comment so people don't keep opening new ones?   ### Steps to reproduce - Get some Android device that doesn't use the Google Play Store - Search the phone's default AppGallery or App Store for Signal - ???? - Use WhatsApp  **Actual result:** No luck **Expected result:** Luck!  ### Device info  **Device:** NOH-NX9 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** :cry:   ### Link to debug log","closed","","pangyuehung","2021-01-22T20:02:47Z","2021-02-20T02:25:38Z"

This happens on both WiFi and LTE. Turning on the toggle to reduce data usage seems to have no effect on this, with the CPU/battery usage no different from when it's off.  So, I decided to perform a system trace to see if there was something discernible in the logs. During an hour-long audio call, I recorded a ~75 second trace and inspected it one Perfetto. In the screenshot attached below, it seems that the network worker thread is using far more CPU time than any of the other threads in the app, in fact, an order of magnitude more time than the next busy thread (AudioEncoder). I'm not an Android developer, and I might be using the trace analyser incorrectly, but it seems rather suspicious that the network thread is doing more work than the audio encoder in this case.  Another thing that stood out to me was the `/vendor/bin/hw/android.hardware.camera.provider@2.4-service_64` process. I do not understand why this service should be using any non-negligible amount of CPU time, as this was an audio call. I was also speaking through a wired headset, so the on-device microphones should not have been active anyway. This is less likely to be connected to the above issue though, given the amount of CPU time it uses (could be a vendor-specific thing).  It would be really helpful if one of the developers could help me look into to this. It's currently a deal-breaker for me with respect to using the app and the service as a daily-driver. I'm willing to run additional traces, debugging measures, etc., and can provide the above trace file upon request.  ### Steps to reproduce - Perform an audio or video call.  **Actual result:** Phone consumes a ""reasonable"" amount of battery for the duration of the call. **Expected result:** Phone consumes an ""unreasonable"" amount of battery for the duration of the call.  ### Screenshots ![signal trace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/214450/110220326-30f5bc00-7ec5-11eb-8480-c8f9ba959666.png)   ### Device info **Device:** ASUS Zenfone 6 **Android version:** 11.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.4.7  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/ffe43d450072887744bdbc466c50450384d7c36266b755381a0e43dc7d5650bb  (The relevant messages should be at the final quarter of the above log file)","open","acknowledged,","shadeMe","2021-03-06T20:57:39Z","2022-07-18T14:30:14Z"

This is of course what you want normally, but in landscape mode this causes the chat and wallpaper to look funny.  ### Steps to reproduce - go to a chat - select a picture that exactly fits your screen - go back to the chat - rotate the screen to landscape mode  **Actual result:** the wallpaper is still scaled to the height of your screen, which is now the short side, causing it to cover only a small portion of the screen. **Expected result:** It should scale the picture to the longest side of the screen and then only show a portion of the wallpaper (preferably the middle part)  ### Screenshots  ![Normal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19656058/105629945-38e22b00-5e46-11eb-9919-158b1908d41f.jpg) ![Landscape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19656058/105629946-3a135800-5e46-11eb-90bc-c23492d40743.jpg)   ### Device info  **Device:** Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.3.2  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/b8d42a94c4f342c0efa15003336514530ade1c4d1271363f21b5e0407ce782dd","closed","","Masqueey","2021-01-24T12:24:01Z","2021-01-24T12:38:08Z"

HUGE delay between seeing the verification page, receiving the validation SMS and receiving the Calls","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  Did Elon Musk created a panic on your registration server? 😄   ### Bug description I created my account yesterday and I still receive codes by phone calls. The SMS were also very slow to get to my phone, and by the time I received them, the verification code had already expired. That was making me make more attempts and there is surely a queue of pending verifications for a lot of new users.  ### Steps to reproduce For the best experience in reading this issue, I highly recommend this background music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRJTfTWidhU - Be me - Install Signal on your Oneplus 5  - Fill the phone number - Wait for the SMS - Wait a bit more - Try to get the code by phone call - Wait - Wait more - Think that there is a problem with your install - Desinstall and resinstall, flush cache etc... - Try again - Ah ! Received an SMS - Try the code: it doesn't works - Wait about 15 minutes - Receive a new code, try it  - Doesn't works because your session has expired and the app is deconnected - Relaunch the app - Try again the code - Code is invalid - Think: ""DAMN ELON MUSK"" - Wait more - Try the call again - Repeat above step about 3 times - Hit the max attempt limit - Start to figure out that millions of people are doing this and that your a part of the problem  In the end I waited one hour and it worked. But the SMS validation came only about one minute after filing the phone number. I received the calls during the night, hours later.  **Actual result:** I totally screwed up your registration server with ton of attempts **Expected result:** You shouldn't let me do this 😄   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** latest in Play **Provider** Free (France)  ### Link to debug log  Creating issue way after the bug occured. I think the app worked fine.         And I'm still receiving calls 😄","closed","","tionebrr","2021-01-09T16:36:45Z","2021-01-10T09:15:14Z"

I expect I will likely have to do so, and will update here with any notable information when I'm done, (though the issue should ideally be addressed regardless of whether or not a backup restore is successful)","closed","","stoppablemurph","2021-05-31T17:36:14Z","2021-06-16T22:21:23Z"

If pasting images isn't supported, it would make sense to have a less generic error message since most people probably encounter this trying to copy/paste an image they found on the web or something and weren't even considering emoticons in their head at any point.  ### Steps to reproduce - Copy an image - Paste it into a conversation  - Encounter confusing/misplaced Toast dialog message  **Actual result:** ""Can't paste emoticons here."" Toast message appears  **Expected result:** Honestly I would just expect the image to be pasted since copy/paste is one of a few ways to share content between apps on Android. But at the very least, I think the Toast error message should say something like ""can't paste images"" or something more generalized because most users probably don't encounter this message when pasting emoticons (not sure what this even means)   ### Device info **Signal version:** 5.2.3","closed","wontfix,","bitmold","2021-01-25T16:25:02Z","2022-04-08T04:26:31Z"

The correct order is not restored after restarting the app.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start a lengthier conversation with a contact on Desktop - Wait a few minutes, keep the Android phone locked - Tap the notification on the Android app immediately(this was important for reproduction in my experience) after unlocking and watch messages replay out of order  **Actual result:** Messages do not arrive in the correct order, nearby messages get shuffled and the conversation is hard to follow **Expected result:** Messages should display consistently in the same order on Android as they initially arrived in on the Desktop app  ### Screenshots Android: ![Screenshot_20210117-192223](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16760685/104852260-38074180-58fa-11eb-97a8-e973be1d05be.jpg)  Desktop ![DesktopScreenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16760685/104852273-4ce3d500-58fa-11eb-8b18-a5fdd9967e9b.png)  You can see the difference by observing the cat sticker.

This often results in accidentally tapping other notifications present in the notification bar.  Some users (like myself) often wish to keep notifications from other apps as unread until they can address them at a more convenient time. The behavior of Signal to minimize the keyboard once new messages are received often causes users to accidentally tap and open these notifications.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive new message - Begin replying to the message via the notification bar - Receive new message - Keyboard will be minimized  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) The keyboard is minimized/hidden if a new message is received when responding to a message from the notification bar.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) The keyboard should stay open when responding to a message from the notification bar even if a new message is received.

However, the prompt always shows up.  ### Steps to reproduce - Clear default for Google Maps on phone - Share a google map location in the chat - Open the location link from the chat, click `SET TO ALWAYS OPEN` - Go back to chat, the prompt always shows up  **Actual result:** location app prompt always shows up despite choosing default app **Expected result:** location links should open with the default app(Google Maps in my case)  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5T **Android version:** 10.0.1 **Signal version:** 5.0.10  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/38e5bebf9170fe55bdf50c86ce4e83a5b395f503d7880d74932693cbe6e6fac4","closed","wontfix,","maysunfaisal","2021-01-13T22:46:10Z","2022-02-03T10:25:51Z"

I've seen other people report similar things. If I switch apps (ex. switch to a game, and then switch back to Signal) my messages start going through.  I think I've found the root cause, so this issue describes the smallest set of steps to reproduce the issue. I will likely send a pull request to fix that small sequence, but that fix will likely need to be made more general.  Possibly related issues since Feb 1: * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11079 * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11071 (perhaps) * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11048 * ~~https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11023~~ * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10974 * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10939  ### Steps to reproduce It is important _not_ to switch Signal into the background during these steps.  *On your phone*  - First, go through the ""registration"" flow: Welcome, Enter Phone, Verify Phone, Re-enter Signal PIN, Enter Profile Info - Second, send a message ""hi"" to another Signal user (""other"")  *On other phone*  - Third, accept the message sender (or see the ""Your safety number ... has changed) - Fourth, reply to the message with ""Hi2""  *On your phone*  - Fifth, wait for a long time (1hr 2 mins and counting) ... no ""Hi2"" message - Sixth, move the Signal app into the background and then back into the foreground. _Sometimes_ you will get the ""Hi2"" message. If you do get a message, it will be immediately after switching apps. - Seventh: If you close the Signal app and re-open, you will get the undelivered messages immediately.  **Actual result:** Reply message is stuck for a long time **Expected result:** You get the reply message within seconds  ### Screenshots    ### Device info **Device:** Android Emulator Pixel 2 XL  **Android version:** 9.0 x86 with Google APIs **Signal version:** 5.5.0  ### Link to debug log * https://debuglogs.org/ca04bcd0d8fd2dd35b1b364c522f47e968874a11d1224ba82715a10d0cc6bf0a is the reproduction steps from ""First"" to ""Fourth"".

(Noise: I additionally sent the first debug log URL to the ""other"" user in step ""Sixth"".) No reply message seen. * https://debuglogs.org/d8267b7509e71e79757e0e6b78e173995e3679ed00ec55d67ffe867dab1826b5 is the steps from ""First"" to ""Fourth"" but only after applying the ""Limited Fix"" below. I can see the reply message immediately.  ### Probable root cause 1 1. The BackgroundMessageRetriever will keep doing ""Skipping retrieval -- app is in the foreground"" correctly because the Signal app has never been in the background. All the FCM messages will be ignored. 2. The IncomingMessageObserver.MessageRetrievalThread will be stuck in an Object wait state (through IncomingMessageObserver.waitForConnectionNecessary). The only way for it to connect to a websocket is if someone notifies IncomingMessageObserver ... which only happens when the Signal app is has a foreground or background event.  3. One of the 5 conditions in IncomingMessageObserver.isConnectionNecessary() is TextSecurePreferences.isPushRegistered() == true. That value changes (see log line `03-12 16:54:39.432 23431 23633 I TextSecurePreferences: Setting push registered: true`). However, according to ""2."" above, there is no one to notify IncomingMessageObserver! If there were some notification, we would see a corresponding `IncomingMessageObserver: Network: true, Foreground: true, FCM: true, Censored: false, Registered: true, Websocket Registered: true, Proxy: false` log line, but we don't.  The above explains why people are getting inconsistent, seemingly irreproducible behavior. Only if they switch their app, the messages magically start. And even switching their app does not always work, because the foreground / background event is not emitted reliably.  ### Probable root cause 2  1. The AppForegroundObserver used by IncomingMessageObserver seems flaky. It would be useful to actually emit a log line when the app is foregrounded or backgrounded to know for sure, but the lack of `IncomingMessageObserver: Network: true, Foreground: true, FCM: true, Censored: false, Registered: true, Websocket Registered: true, Proxy: false` log line in the second debug log even after foregrounding/backgrounding repeatedly indicates that AppForegroundObserver is not reliable.  ### Limited Fix for probable root cause 1  Added ""new code"" to the bottom of `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.registration.service.CodeVerificationRequest#verifyAccount`  ```java     TextSecurePreferences.setWebsocketRegistered(context, true);     // ...     TextSecurePreferences.setPushRegistered(context, true);     // ...     // BEGIN new code     IncomingMessageObserver incomingMessageObserver = ApplicationDependencies.getIncomingMessageObserver();     synchronized (incomingMessageObserver) {       incomingMessageObserver.notifyAll();     }     // END new code      PinState.onRegistration(context, kbsData, pin, hasPin); ```  This limited, hacky fix just sends an `Object.notifyAll()` notification after the registration flow. A more general fix would be to send a notification when any of the 5 conditions changes. For example, any change via TextSecurePreferences.setPushRegistered should directly or indirectly notify IncomingMessageObserver.  I could submit a pull request as-is *or* do a more clean and more general fix.

"","11096","Impossible to press ""send"" button again when getting back from the contact list","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description The blue ""send"" button appears but nothing happens when pressing it when I try to send the photo. That only occurs when I try to take a picture from the main conversation list (""home"" of the app), then click send (which gets me to the contact list to select the people I want to send the picture to), then go back because I want to modify it. At that moment it's impossible to click the ""send"" button again.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Go to the main conversation list - Click the camera button in the bottom right corner - Take a picture - Click the blue button with an arrow on it (""send"") in the bottom right corner to send the picture - That should take you to the contact list. Go back to picture you just took (let's imagine you forgot to add a message on it) - Try to click the ""send"" button again. Nothing happens.  **Actual result:** You can still modify your text (both on your picture or in the actual message) but nothing happens when you click on the ""send"" button. You're stuck on that screen, you can only go back. **Expected result:** Clicking on that button should take you to the contact list to select the people you want to send the picture to.  ### Screenshots  ![signal-2021-03-13-101555](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30692513/111025571-45fead80-83e5-11eb-9042-72e02373936e.jpeg)   ### Device info  **Device:** Xiaomi Poco M3 from Xiaomi France **Android version:** 10 QKQ1.200830.002 (MIUI Global 12.0.6 Stable 12.0.6.0(QJFEUXM) **Signal version:** 5.4.12  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/dd501b5fd2b0cda62494d460f50318cb816e046fec8f54cdca77bcc5697b970f","closed","wontfix,","CamilleKaze","2021-03-13T09:24:38Z","2022-02-02T16:36:04Z"

See the above image, first one is android share sheet and second one is home screen with app shortcuts on long press. Now as the app claims to expose as much less of data as possible to android system to protect user privacy, but here the android operating system is getting access to your contact names , group names and also knows that these are the people you frequently talk to. This is a privacy loophole disguised inside a feature. I understand that those share targets in share sheet and long press shortcuts to chats on homescreen  are good features, but they cost privacy. Also think of the fact that people use all kinds of home launchers on android and they get to see this contact data.  I would like to ask for views of maintainers on this.  ### Steps to reproduce - Go to browser and share any link , that will open android share sheet - Go to homescreen and long press on the signal app icon  **Actual result:**  frequently contacted contact names and group names get exposed to android system **Expected result:** Both features should not be there to protect user privacy  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_20210115-132658_Android_System~2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32611332/104697590-fe85d900-5735-11eb-8be9-e6ff83cff728.png)  ![Screenshot_20210115-132708_Pixel_Launcher~2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32611332/104697609-0776aa80-5736-11eb-85ed-35a82199f3b9.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Xiaomi Redmi 5 plus Derpfest Custom ROM **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.1.8  ### Link to debug log Not relevant","closed","wontfix,","tanujkucp","2021-01-15T08:11:10Z","2022-02-03T08:09:11Z"

The restore will only work on the **same** device.  **Backup** - The backup file is created by class `FullBackupExporter`. - When `FullBackupExporter.export()` is called in `LocalBackupJob`, it uses `AttachmentSecretProvider.getInstance(context).getOrCreateAttachmentSecret()` for parameter `attachmentSecret`. - Class `AttachmentSecretProvider` will create a random secret the first time that this function is ran. The secret is stored securely (and **privately**) to the Android KeyStore. - Note that `attachmentSecret` is a dedicated encryption key, which is used to encrypt/decrypt attachments, stickers and avatars. It is different than the public 30-character passphrase, which is the 5th input parameter `passphrase` of `FullBackupExporter.export()`. So basically the encryption makes use of **two** encryption keys. Where one is public for the user, and the other **private** in the KeyStore. ❌  **Restore** - When Signal is installed fresh from the Play Store on a different device, class `FullBackupImporter` handles decrypting of the backup file. - Class `RestoreBackupFragment` will call `FullBackupImporter.importFile()`. Again with `AttachmentSecretProvider.getInstance(context).getOrCreateAttachmentSecret()` for parameter `attachmentSecret`. Since there is no value present in the KeyStore on this device, class `AttachmentSecretProvider` will create a random secret. Instead of reading the one that was used on device A while the backup was created. ❌ - This means that decrypting attachments, stickers and avatars (e.g. in `processSticker()` of `FullBackupImporter`) will use a different value for `attachmentSecret` than the one the data was encrypted with while creating the backup. ❌ **As a result, the decrypted data is incorrect.**  This seems to be a conceptual failure. And might explain the dozens of open issues regarding failed restore actions. - What is the purpose of the `attachmentSecret`? - Why is this kept private in the Android KeyStore? - Why encrypt twice/use a different key for the attachments, stickers and avatars?","closed","wontfix,","funnel20","2021-01-21T00:05:35Z","2022-02-02T17:36:23Z"

As far as I understand it this means that the blocked user should still get delivery reports, while the blocker never actually gets those messages. Between Android->iOS, and between either and Desktop, this is what I observe.  When sending to an Android user, the blocked user immediately stops getting delivery reports - only one check. This is inconsistent with the other platforms that I have tested. It seems like a data leak to the blocked user that they are blocked (also implicitly the platform that the blocker is using).  ~Interestingly, with a Desktop client is in the mix: if the blocked user sends a message via Desktop it _will_ indicate that the message is delivered. When that message is synced to the Android client, it syncs the delivery status also.~ I can't reproduce this reliably but I have screenshots of it. Not sure what the deal is, but it smells like a data race - [related?](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8843)  ### Steps to reproduce - Android user A blocks  user B - User B sends message to user A  **Actual result:** User B does **not** get the second check for ""delivered"" on their message, potentially implying they are blocked **Expected result:** User B gets the second check for ""delivered"" on their message, consistent with the other Signal platforms  ### Screenshots     ### Device info  **Device:** Various, Pixel 5, 4XL, 3A **Android version:** Latest Android 11 1/2021 patch (RQ1D.210105.003 on Pixel 5) **Signal version:** 5.1.1  ### Link to debug log  Blocked (User B) log: https://debuglogs.org/0dac4bad4a1179586cdc97225a003eeecb3cee15399d3eaf60f94ee912cb3291 Blocker (User A) log: https://debuglogs.org/1c8c16fa607521b0b893d169f7d5ee0831290651bda28ffa025514af949443eb  --- I've been ramping up on the Android source to try and find where things are going wrong and contrib the fix, but maybe someone could point me in the right direction to speed that up?

If you now scroll back up (enlarging the picture again), the name **will not return back to it's full state.** It will stay cut off.  ### Steps to reproduce (This might be device-specific due to different screen-sizes. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9) - Create a new group with the name `Isekai Himmelfahrtskommando` - Click on the group-name to go to that group-settings-page. - See that the group-name is displayed in its full length. - Scroll down. Doesn't matter the distance you travel, at the shortest swiping-action the group-name will turn into `Isekai Himmelfahrtskomm…` - **Bug:** Now try to get the full `Isekai Himmelfahrtskommando` back by swiping back. You can't.  **Actual result:** You are not able to ever get the full `Isekai Himmelfahrtskommando` back just by swiping. Only leaving the group-settings-page and then comming back to it resets the group name.  **Expected result:** When the user swipes back up (=placing everything at it's original locations, the `…` should disappear and the full group title should be shown again, as was previously the case.  ### Screenshots  ![signal-2021-02-02-194027_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59611881/106647175-e237c800-658e-11eb-92f1-fdd2805141ad.jpeg) ![signal-2021-02-02-194027_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59611881/106647179-e368f500-658e-11eb-9574-ec6d20dd945d.jpeg) ![signal-2021-02-02-194027_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59611881/106647184-e4018b80-658e-11eb-9004-48d25b36e044.jpeg)   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S9 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.3.7.1","closed","wontfix,","Glitchy-Tozier","2021-02-02T18:43:25Z","2022-02-03T13:38:26Z"

This is very typical behavior as I have earbuds in, make a phone call and then immediately press the power button and put the phone in my pocket.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have bluetooth headset connected - Initiate direct phone call with someone - Press the power button on the phone to initiate lock screen - Observe when the call is connected, the other person cannot hear you  **Actual result:** Observe when the call is connected, the other person cannot hear you **Expected result:** The other person should be able to hear you  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S20 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.2.3","open","acknowledged,","djschny","2021-01-20T21:56:45Z","2022-04-05T16:57:17Z"

I'm not sure why this only happens on my device, but I think I found the root cause.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open a conversation (I have 100% repro rate in 1:1 conversations but groups don't seem to repro for some reason) - Begin composing a message to open the keyboard - Lock the screen - Unlock the screen (critically, on my device the keyboard is closed by the system during this lock/unlock cycle and the bug does not repro on my friends' devices where this is not true) - Press the back button  **Actual result:**  The app will be in a state where the back button has no effect regardless of how many times it's pressed.  **Expected result:**  The back button should pop the conversation activity and bring up the conversation list.  ### Screenshots Not comfy sharing screenshots since I don't have a burner phone sorry :(  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 4A **Android version:** 11 (running GrapheneOS not the stock rom) **Signal version:** 5.8.x (Going from memory here) and a build built from the current master branch.  ### Link to debug log  Let me know if you need this.  ### Probable root cause  For some reason the system chooses to close the soft keyboard during the lock/unlock cycle. I'm not entirely sure why this happens. When the system is unlocked, `onMeasure` is called in `KeyboardAwareLinearLayout`, but I don't think the resize has actually completed yet. My hypothesis is that `getAvailableHeight` returns the old height, which causes the keyboard state to not be updated during the device unlock. Since the old state sticks around, the layout continues to believe that the keyboard is open. That bad state in `KeyboardAwareLinearLayout` causes the `onBackPressed` logic in `ConversationActivity` to trigger the keyboard closure flow instead of the `super.onBackPressed` flow. Since the keyboard isn't actually open, it can't be closed so the entire back button press is a no-op.  It seems like triggering `updateKeyboardState` and `onRotation` in `KeyboardAwareLinearLayout.onSizeChanged` instead of `KeyboardAwareLinearLayout.onMeasure` fixes this issue, which supports the theory that onMeasure is called too early in the resize operation for `getAvailableHeight` to return the correct (new) value. That could have ripple effects elsewhere in the codebase but it seems like a fairly safe change overall, so I'm going to send a PR for it.","closed","","ellenhp","2021-05-02T22:43:08Z","2021-05-03T14:57:54Z"

But this is an issue I've seen for some time.  So, a friend sends me a message (a voice message especially), and it's simply not delivered. He then contacts me on Threema and tells me ""hey, didn't you get my message I sent you on signal"", and my response is ""no"", and then, we go to signal. I find absolutely nothing, and he finds a status that doesn't make sense. I see here, for example, 1 hollow check mark for messages I know that my friend has received.   This problem happened before the spike in the number of users of signal last week. However, after the spike, it got much, much worse.  The thing is, this should never happen. Message statuses should be 100% consistent and should indicate whether my contacts received the messages or not. There shouldn't be states in between. Also, more importantly, there should a ""retry"" option, just like Whatsapp. It seems to me the protocol now just sends the message, and the confirmation can be lost somehow.  Thank you for a great app.   ### Steps to reproduce Some times (especially voice) messages don't arrive, and more importantly, there's no way to know they didn't arrive. I don't know how to reproduce that.  ### Screenshots Not needed  ### Device info  **Device:** Galaxy Note 10 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.1.9  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/d068fb572b2ed8216c4bcd13218dc258855f798316d40300f0a29bee548e8acb","closed","wontfix,","TheQuantumPhysicist","2021-01-17T12:10:49Z","2022-06-06T12:19:45Z"

When I try to listen to a voice message and I bring my phone close to the ear the screen should turn off and the message should play on the ear speaker, but this happens only sometimes. Sometimes when I bing the phone to my ear the sound still plays from the media speaker, sometimes it plays from the ear speaker but the screen doesn't turn off. Sometimes it works more or less as intended. In whatsapp or telegram when I play a voice message a light blinks near my front camera, meaning the proximity sensor is active, and when I bring my phone close to my ear the screen instantly turns off and the sounds plays from the ear speaker. This is the way it should work and it has always worked perfectly in those apps. In signal the blinking light doesn't appear at all.  ### Steps to reproduce - Press the play button to start playing a voice message - Bring the phone close to the ear - See what happens  **Actual result:** When I play a voice message and I bring my phone close to my ear the sound still playes from the media speakers. Other times it plays from the ear speakers but the screen doesn't turn off, accepting as input the touch of my face on the screen. When it works it's not as fast and precise as others instant messaging apps **Expected result:** When I play a voice message and I bring my phone close to my ear the screen should immediately turn off and the sound should play only from the ear speakers.   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10 **Android version:** Android 11 **Signal version:** 5.3.7.1  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/3a548d8562d54f5261eef565808e287daa0b47fe5d09e5706c3ce667a12d973d","closed","","lnwor","2021-02-05T17:10:28Z","2022-02-04T15:25:37Z"

I can replicate this problem with all other contacts.  ### Steps to reproduce -voicemail audios play no sound at all -same contact, scroll up and click on to play a previous voicemail audio, audio plays with sound.  -same issue can be replicated with all other contacts.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots This audio file works: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80849221/111517691-92fac080-8712-11eb-98b9-c774fd8f8307.png)  This audio file doesn't work, note it also doesn't show any voice audio ranged just a flat line ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80849221/111517792-b160bc00-8712-11eb-8e65-232d13ae1f4e.png)   ### Device info Device:** Samsung Note 9 - SM-N960W Android version: Stock Android version 10 Signal version: 5.4.12  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1299112b6ddf52ab1faae33c4d0f6f94152d1865e52e15be6275a0e5c9a738bc","closed","wontfix,","khoa81","2021-03-17T18:27:03Z","2022-02-02T17:36:17Z"

Signal did not stop me from copying all the chat messages from my old phone to new one even when the number used in both the phones are different. I don't know if this is actually intentionally or if you missed to include the condition, but I think this can be used by people to copy their chats to a different phone if they got access to the original phone. I came to know about this only after I found that I was no longer a part of some groups I used to be in, but I can see old chats.  Except this, everything else looks as if I am using my old account itself.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use transfer account feature in old phone with number 'A' - Use a different number in new phone with number 'B' - Continue the account transfer process and the process with succeed even when the phone number used in the second device is different  **Actual result:** Account gets transferred even when the phone number is different. **Expected result:** Account should not transfer as the phone numbers are different   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus Nord **Android version:** 11.0 **Signal version:** 5.5.2","closed","","abhinavtk97","2021-03-17T18:19:04Z","2021-03-17T23:02:01Z"

I have looked at multiple threads here from users saying it was a permission issue from Oneplus, and I've used ADB to grant Signal all needed permissions to make sure it's not that. I've force stopped, cleared app cache, cleared dalvik/phone cache, restarted to no effect. I've backed up my messages successfully, and they restore successfully on a fresh Signal install but I still cant open a convo. If I don't restore the convo's, creating a new message will crash after I choose a contact.  I receive notifications properly, and can view all messages and reply on the Desktop client.  In the logcat I can see issues about parsing the phone number and I'm wondering if that is the culprit or not...  ### Steps to reproduce - Open app - Select conversation - Crash :)  **Actual result:** Black screen before a crash **Expected result:** Conversation thread opens for viewing  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus 5T (OxygenOS 10.0.0 Stable) **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.1.8  ### Link to debug log https://pastebin.com/7PkQrwNr","closed","","evanBurg","2021-01-14T22:59:18Z","2021-01-16T20:01:21Z"

This is very likely a new move from the Iranian authorities in line with their previous efforts on blocking access to Signal within the country. They have probably blocked the number(s) from which Signal sends out activation codes to users?. If so, this needs to be fixed otherwise no one in Iran will be able to join Signal or reinstall Signal on a new device/number. I am already aware of the Iranian government ban on Signal on ISP level, but that has so far been bypassed by Iranians using VPNs or proxies. While this new activation code delivery ban means users inside Iran have no way around it, something needs to be done by Signal urgently. An alternative solution might be sending out the activation codes to users' other devices with Signal installed on them, similar to what Telegram does. For example my friend has previously installed Signal on Windows and the activation code can be sent out to his Signal on Windows. Or Signal can possibly send out the activation codes from random numbers or using Sender ID, similar to what Google does.","closed","","VanGHub","2021-03-05T13:48:24Z","2021-03-06T10:00:12Z"

So I avoided clicking on the link. Still I tried to warn the other person about the issue by sending him/her an article about this.  What then happened surprised me: sending an answer was enough to trigger an exploit that would send lots of sms (probably with a similar content) to other people. Those messages weren't listed in signal afterwards. The os warned me about signal sending lots of messages. ![Screenshot_20210320-201235](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5685512/111883694-42f35680-89bd-11eb-857a-85a715bd6545.jpg) So I was able to abort it.

I think the exploit happens at roughly 20:11:57 I could be wrong though. The second time it happened a bit later while writing an email in another Programm. mostly because it took a bit of time to try and send the message. I have two mobile carriers (two sim cards). The carrier of my default sms number has issues right now (a storm damaged the cell tower nearby, so zero bars of connectivity).  I don't know whether the bug happens in Android (SMS framework) or in signal itself, but signal might be able to detect this anyways and delete such kind of message or even fix the exploit.   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 3T **Android version:** 10, Custom rom: Havoc OS 3.12  **Signal version:** 5.4.12 (the playstore tells me there is a new version ready, so I'll install that now)  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/a8a6235ae6a0072b93046de1584a1fde6ee78b3964aa0d81fef145b88808a72c","closed","","Djfe","2021-03-20T19:56:46Z","2021-03-22T19:44:58Z"

If you click Turn off, and confirm you want to delete the backups, Signal will still show that it is working (via a notification) to create backups in external storage **and will in fact continue to write to external storage**.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Settings -> Chats -> Chat backups - Click ""TURN ON""  - Check the confirmation check box and then click ""ENABLE BACKUPS"" *(also maybe the ""ENABLE BACKUPS"" button should be disabled if the checkbox isn't checked, that approach is a pretty widely used UX thing... instead you can click ""ENABLE BACKUPS"" with the checkbox unchecked and the user gets an error message in a Toast. more stuff to localize and what not. anyway)*  - Signal will start start working to write stuff to disk. There will be a Progress Bar and what not.  - Click ""TURN OFF"" - then confirm that you want your backups **deleted** by clicking the ""DELETE BACKUPS"" button in the dialog that appears - the UI will reset to the initial ""Chat backups"" screen with the ""TURN ON"" button from earlier, however, there will still be a nondissmissable notification that shows that Signal is writing backups to disk (pictured below)  **Actual result:** Signal keeps dumping encrypted backup data to disk even after you tell it to stop after clicking a button that says  ""DELETE BACKUPS""  If you open the file browser to the ""Backup folder"" location there will be a hidden backup file that continues to grow in size after you click ""DELETE BACKUPS"". To most users of Signal, finding this file is completely beyond their understanding of how their phone works though they might attempt to see what's going on if they get a system notification telling them that they're running out of disk space.  From here, one of two undesirable things will happen depending on the amount of available disk space on your Android device:   1. In the event that you have enough disk space to actually write the entire backup to disk, it will be written, however on the Signal chat backups screen backups will appear to be turned off. Users have to manually find the backup file and delete it from disk since Signal has more or less ""lost track"" of this file. Even though at this point the file will no longer be hidden, it's still very much beyond most users capacity to track down this file (especially because the UI no longer shows the file path since backups are ""off"") and even if users know where to find the file and how to get rid of it, they are at this point under the impression that the file was deleted...   2. In the event that you don't have enough disk space, users will eventually be presented with a notification that explains that the backup which they aborted can not be written to disk due to space constraints. Prior to this happening, the user's disk will be filled up to 100% capacity.   **Expected result:** **ALL** backup data should immediately cease being written and deleted from disk. There also shouldn't be any notifications that shows that Signal is still writing backups after you told it not to. Users shouldn't have to hunt down enormous files on their phone that they were wrongly informed have been deleted.  ### Screenshots ![creatingbackup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22125581/105743922-a3f53580-5f0a-11eb-8a3e-1c387c67e50d.jpeg) This notification keeps on working while backups are still being written to disk after you click ""TURN OFF"" and then confirm by clicking ""DELETE BACKUPS""   ![backupfailed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22125581/105744347-fcc4ce00-5f0a-11eb-92d8-4b713374f30f.jpeg) This is the notification you get from the second undesired outcome mentioned above   ### Device info **Signal version:** 5.2.3","closed","","bitmold","2021-01-25T18:01:07Z","2021-03-12T21:16:43Z"

It just happens at random times.  **Actual result:** Bogus unread notifications are shown which starts like ""Most recent from ..."". Using the notification to open the app shows me that there are no new unread messages. **Expected result:** No such bogus notifications are shown.  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20210511-181523](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448084/117859730-03563600-b2ad-11eb-99b7-c8831921b214.jpg)   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus Nord **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.11.0  ### Link to debug log I don't have one yet.

If I call another Nokia 7.2 (multiple in family) I hear me, too. So my device makes trouble. It's the same as #7635 and much more.  I tried to test by my own build, but I could not install/test it, because of mismatched signature and I don't want to delete all data/settings. (How do you do this?! Backup, uninstall, install fix, test, uninstall, install original, restore all the time?!)  I know this would be a kind of feature request, but it would be great, if this would be configurable (under advanced option or something else). Most people would not do a bug report and could not/don't want to test before releasing mainstream. Also you could not check it without having the same device. But is it the real problem? So the signal community could help other users. Until now - I had a few people who sad signal sucks because of this problem. It don't work out of the box - most people have no interest why?! It would be great to ease this procedure... Second a user could easily check, if the hardware AEC is fixed in a later Android release of the manufacture.  ``` [ro.product.manufacturer]: [HMD Global] [ro.product.model]: [Nokia 7.2] [ro.product.model.display]: [TA-1196] ```  ### Steps to reproduce - Call another signal contact or another contact call me  **Actual result:** Others hear an echo **Expected result:** No echo for other parties    ### Device info  **Device:** HMD Global Nokia 7.2 **Android version:** 10 Build 00WW_2_390_SP01 (latest update from dec 2020) **Signal version:** 5.0.8","closed","wontfix,","bammab","2021-01-09T13:30:58Z","2022-01-28T05:06:46Z"

This appears to be an issue only with contrast on dark mode.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open signal app in dark mode with a system alert visible  **Actual result:** Can not read text of banner/alert. **Expected result:** Banner is visible, with high enough contrast for text to be readable.  ### Screenshots Was unable to grab a screenshot as the outage and associated banner was removed before I thought to grab one.   ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 4a **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.8.10  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/de9322c82fe02a9ec81b5976306d4eb48b2af943e134769ea3ed976e16e123c0","closed","","fuzzzerd","2021-05-04T21:52:45Z","2021-05-14T19:59:28Z"

Setting a conversation to Priority in the Android notification shade does not make them priority next time the next notification is received. Conversations marked as priority should be maintained to take advantage of [People and Conversation features in Android 11](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/conversations#testing).  ### Steps to reproduce  1. Receive conversation notification 2. Long press notification, mark as Priority, tap Done then observe yellow ring around contact. 3. Long press on the same notification, tap the gear icon to then observe Conversation channel in Android System settings.  Now this contact should be marked as Priority going forward until the app is Force stopped.  4. Navigate to Signal App Info page, tap Force stop. 5. Launch Signal. 6. Navigate to Signal App Info page > Notifications, observe conversation channel in step 3 is now missing. 7. Receive notification from same contact in step 1 and observe it is no longer has a yellow ring (no longer Priority 🐞). 8. Long press on this notification, observe that _now_ yellow ring is now present. 9. Tap on the gear icon and now observe that this channel is now again present in Signal App Info > Notification settings (until it is Force stopped or killed by system.)  **Actual result:**  Next conversation notification from the same person does not have ring around it anymore and is not marked as priority as a side effect conversations that were set to Bubble no longer bubble.  **Expected result:**  Conversation notification should maintain priority so that it takes advantage of Android 11 OS features.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.11.5  ## Debug log https://debuglogs.org/43c93b5f399825843247e872917b87641923b3e2d720fe17b8cab4dd23cb9483","closed","","aeroechelon","2021-02-08T17:25:36Z","2021-06-16T15:05:23Z"

[link to official guide](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007319011-Manage-Contacts)  > Go to Android Settings > Accounts > Signal > Menu > Remove Account. The alert of clearing data is incorrect, your messages will not be deleted. In Signal, tap Android_Compose.png Compose to view your Signal contact list. Pull down on your contact list to refresh and update.   However on my phone, there is no Signal app under the Accounts. I tried to press on the plus button to add it, nothing happen and then my phone just freezed until I press the android back button.  I have also tried to add a new contact in the Signal app.  The contact is successfully added to my phone, however it still doesn't show up in the Signal app and I also can't seach for it.  Have asked a few friends on Android and some of them are having the same problem.  My other group of friends on IPhone have the Signal app works fine though.  ### Screenshots  Can't take screenshots  ### Device info  **Device:** HTC 10 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 5.2.3  ### Link to debug log  Added: My debug log after enabling sms and refresh the contact list: [https://debuglogs.org/8c3b27c4d212334e8d965b675298390e585fab1422d1bc2bf96068c7ae2bdded](https://debuglogs.org/8c3b27c4d212334e8d965b675298390e585fab1422d1bc2bf96068c7ae2bdded)","closed","wontfix,","timc986","2021-01-19T18:07:40Z","2022-02-02T20:17:51Z"

This makes sending high-resolution photos impossible. As if they wete banned by a dictatorship.  ### Steps to reproduce - Take a ~4K photo with your best camera, showing fine, beautiful details. - Send it to another phone over Signal. - Save the received image to you phone's memory.  **Actual result:** All the details are replaced by a blocky mess with washed-out colors when zooming in inside Sigal. The saved photo is now 1600×1200px in size. **Expected result:** The full size should be available to the recipient, even on a slow connection and an old device. As that was the intent, and there is no point of what was to be communicated is censored and lost. If necessary, the full resolution version can be deferred, and the user visually informed that this is not the full version intendee, and that he csn wait until a better connection is available or force it now. On wifi, pictures should never be recompressed. (Unless until is guaranteed to he lossless to the actual pixel data.) Sending it as a file is not a solution either, as there is no preview, and even if there was, it might still be low-resolution, still ruining the intent of the communication.  ### Screenshots  (Let's hope, github does not recompress those…) ![Original photo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58148887/117117800-40439980-ad90-11eb-8591-198f730de850.jpg) ![Signal’s abomination](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58148887/117117830-476aa780-ad90-11eb-8bf4-83238cf9564b.jpg) Zoom in on the former, and note how the entire point is lost in the latter.  ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei Mate 10 Pro (with a beautiful Leica camera) **Android version:** 10.0.183 **Signal version:** 5.8.10  ### Link to debug log  (If this is necessary to resolve this, please ask.)","closed","wontfix,","navid-zamani","2021-05-05T08:58:29Z","2022-02-18T15:18:37Z"

Also, this is a really minor issue, but I thought I'd report it as Samsung has quite a large market share and more and more Samsung phones will be running One UI 3.0/Android 11, so it would be nice if the design of these frequently viewed icons looks good. Thanks for developing Signal 🎉!  ### Steps to reproduce - Use Signal on a Samsung phone with One UI 3.0/Android 11 - Receive and view a Signal notification - Open the quick actions by long pressing the Signal app icon on the home screen/launcher  **Actual result:** The contact icon's have black edges **Expected result:** Show the contact icons without black edges  ### Screenshots Screenshot showing the black edges around a contact's icon when receiving a Signal notification: ![Screenshot_20210114-133746_Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/696839/104936547-f71c3500-59ac-11eb-8a7f-b185708167e1.jpg)  Screenshot showing the black edges around contact icons when long pressing the Signal app icon on the home screen/launcher: ![Screenshot_20210114-133805_One UI Home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/696839/104936845-5c702600-59ad-11eb-8fe0-ff2dfa576f11.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10 **Android version:** 11.0 **Signal version:** 5.1.9","closed","","siccovansas","2021-01-18T16:00:34Z","2021-07-27T22:54:49Z"

The bug I noticed always happens in my tested scenario while normal messages are always being sent.  **Bug:** For all messages Signal starts the sending process for, while the Signal Android app is in the background, the message will be sent to the Signal servers, but never be delivered to the receiver. Even if you open the Signal app manually afterwards. If you then send a message directly from within the Signal app, the message is being delivered to the receiver while the prevoious background message has only one tick and never arrives. Receiving messages while Signal is in the background also works without problems and also shows a notification.  **Scenarios when this is the case:** Replying directly from the Android notification while Signal is closed leads to the message never being sent - even after launching the Signal app afterwards. Same happens if you click on ""Mark as read"" - then the receiver will never receive the Read Ticks. (Replying from within the notification while the Signal app is in the foreground works fine) Another scenario is if you type a message within the Signal app while your internet connection is turned off, then leave the Signal app, turn the internet connection on, wait a moment, then you can return to the Signal app and the message is never being delivered, but sent to the server.  Looks like it might be an issue with the encryption while the app is in the background or a general issue with the background process.  ### Steps to reproduce Scenario 1 - Go to the home screen of your device - Ask a friend to send you a Signal message - Then you receive an Android notification in the status bar of your device - Within the notification click on ""Reply"" or ""Mark as read"" and send the message - Your friend then never receives this reply or the ticks which show when the message was read even if you open the Signal app afterwards  Scenario 2 - Open a chat in the Signal app - Disable your internet connection - Type and send a message - Close the Signal app - Turn on your internet connection - Your friend then never receives this message even if you open the Signal app afterwards  **Actual result:** The message was sent to the Signal servers, but never arrives at the receivers device. **Expected result:** The message should be delivered without any issues    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** Tested: 5.1.9 & 5.2.0  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/03bd154c27a4c81c40cb609e1305571533a45aa08096650a8774975e3fae6a4b","closed","","T1mmyK0","2021-01-16T14:06:00Z","2021-01-17T09:47:09Z"

The screen remains unchanged, still displaying the buttons to answer the call.  After multiple seconds I will hear a noise that indicates the start of a call. The screen shown during the call then appears and video becomes visible. At the point when the video becomes visible, the call duration is usually already about 12 seconds.  #### Voice call When I receive a call, I press the green button to start the call. The screen changes to the normal in-call screen, I can see the duration of the call at the top of the screen, the seconds start to count. However, I cannot hear the other person and I don't think they can hear me. After multiple seconds I will hear a noise that seems to indicate the start of a call.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have someone call you, video or voice, from Android or iOS (desktop untested) - Answer the call  **Actual result:** The call will start, but there is no audio or video for multiple seconds. This causes confusion and results in lots of calls starting with ""can you hear me""s. **Expected result:** The call starts audio and video work almost instantaneously (within less than a second at least).  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G6 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.11.5   ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/65d25d427534c953fe6c607bb4348d1f7f698c9bd6b06eadbdc028f973a58780 To my untrained eye it looks like the call is answered at 2021-06-01 18:29:00 and video becomes visible at 2021-06-01 18:29:12","open","acknowledged,","spagy","2021-06-01T18:40:43Z","2022-04-26T16:19:54Z"

I am using Nova Launcher and for some reason it seems to like to get to my default home screen page every single time I close the app but I don't want this ""feature"" because its very annoying.)  ### Steps to reproduce - Open the app. - Enter multitasking or task switching view on the Android device.  - Close the app. - After closing the app it redirects to the default page on the Launcher.  **Actual result:** After closing the app it redirects to the default page on the Launcher. **Expected result:** Signal app should not redirect to the default page on the Launcher and just close itself.  ### Screenshots Hard to take screenshots as it presents animations to go to home screen.    ### Device info   Device info: samsung SM-G920V (zerofltevzw) (Samsung Galaxy S6 - Verizon) Android version: 7.0 (G920VVRS4DQD1, NRD90M.G920VVRS4DQD1) Signal version: 5.0.8 Signal package: org.thoughtcrime.securesms (doDiFGKPO1r) Nova Launcher version: Prime 6.2.3 (+ Custom Gestures, I checked if this is an issue, it is not the cause) Registration lock: false Locale: en_US  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/b0b8201e4f1df4d18746e6f3ef046ab718d1a2daf119a584d922709181c08adc    Please fix this issue, I have no clue what's causing it, I'd like to know if its a setting I could turn off.

(There might be reasons to do this, e.g. her phone is out of battery and she expects an urgent call, etc.).  After this I noticed that I suddenly had many of her contacts in my phone book. Turned out that she had stored her contacts on her SIM-card and that only contacts were added that also are on Signal. So it must have been Signal that added these contacts without asking.  **This is a privacy issue!**  ### Steps to reproduce  I was able to reproduce this:  1.  I used a card reader to add two contacts to a 2nd SIM-card that weren't in the phones address book yet. One who has Signal, one who hasn't. (You might use a 2nd phone instead of a card reader) 2.  I added this SIM-card to my phone, did a restart and a speed test for testing the internet connection, and took a look on my contacts with [Simple Contacts](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.contacts.pro/) (which I did not have installed when this happened the 1st time) 2.  Then I removed the SIM-card again and inserted my regular SIM-card.  **Actual result:** The contact that also is on Signal remained in my adress book while the other contact didn't. **Expected result:** Signal should at least ask me if I want to copy contacts from the SIM card into my phones adress book.   ### Device info  **Device:** Blackberry Key1 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 5.4.12  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/096dd0ee8435c85eb7f454e96e72c8b0752807aec07082d8ea2bcc4e1dfb7ad8","closed","wontfix,","Flexmaen","2021-03-23T00:58:52Z","2022-03-29T07:57:33Z"

In some case e.g. https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10726 it is not possible to send the DebugLog within the app. E.g. Network is not available or the Signal App is not working while connected to the network.   Therefor there should be the option to copy/past the log or should be stored locally. To allow sending out of band.   ### Steps to reproduce  Disconnect your Phone from the network. E.g. switch to flight mode.

Most people have the contact written down as 11 xxxx-xxxx . This format works fine in most other messaging app (Telegram, WhatsApp etc) Those app will usually add the prefix +54 9 which is the prefix needed for inbound international calls. However sometime numbers end up being saved as +54 11 xxxx-xxxx, which is also a valid number for international inbound SMS text, (which is what most apps used to validate the users phone number). Signal apparently thinks +54 11 xxxx-xxxx and +54 9 11 xxxx-xxxx are two distinct phone numbers, when in practice they are the same. The end result is that depending on how the contact number is saved Signal might not recognise the number as a valid Signal profile and the users wont be able to communicate with each other.  Proposed quick fix: If the user knows which contact is not showing up they can try changing the number to 11 xxxx xxxx, +54 11 xxxx xxxx or +54 9 11 xxxxx xxxx, refreshing contacts and just figuring out which one works by trial and error.  Long term fix Update Signal to recognise 11 xxxx xxxx, +54 11 xxxx xxxx and +54 9 11 xxxxx xxxx as the same number. It's just a regex fix, it's not that tricky   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime (SM-G570M)  **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.0.8","closed","","SexyPantz","2021-01-11T18:54:45Z","2021-10-12T18:37:35Z"

However, the notification still persists and does not disappear until I 'mark as read' or swipe it away. Replying to the message through notifications does not 'mark as read', however it should. Replying to the message makes the assumption that the user has read the message, and therefore the notification should be dismissed.   ### Steps to reproduce - get message - In notifications, press reply and type message, and reply  - leave notification area - notification persists  **Actual result:** Notification stays in notification area after replying **Expected result:** notification stays in notification area after replying BUT when navigating away from notification area, notification should disappear. I believe the issue lies in that replying through notifications does not generate a 'read message' state and therefore does not remove the message from my notifications. It should generate a 'read message' state similar to clicking the conversation in the app.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.9.5  ### Link to debug log","closed","","marko-kovacevic","2021-05-05T17:06:05Z","2021-05-05T21:10:39Z"

Even when am added, I don't see messages on the group.  And also I can't create a group. It seems group doesn't work on the app.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use the signal app on Android   - Get a group invitation.  - Click it and go to the Signal App.   **Actual result:**  The loading screen loads forever without adding me to the intended group. And also messages sent in the group I was added to won't even show up that I was added.  **Expected result:** I should be able to do all this successfully   ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20210109-062019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73845970/104084047-fd3f4280-5243-11eb-97aa-13690b876191.png)    ### Device info  **Device:**ZTE BLADE V7 MAX **Android version:** 6.0 **Signal version:** 5.0.8  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/a3881a50aa14ffa99cffcb8504d90949822494b842d798523f7096a313dadf54","closed","","suftdev","2021-01-09T05:34:44Z","2021-01-09T14:59:35Z"

This occurs despite Signal being set as the default SMS/MMS app and despite it being possible within Signal to create a new message to a non-Signal user and then add an attachment.  ### Steps to reproduce - locate an image in Google Photos - select the 'share' link - select Signal as the sharing app - view the resulting list of contacts  **Actual result:** No non-Signal contacts are shown, not possible to send (for example) an MMS to a non-Signal contact **Expected result:** All contacts are shown in the share dialogue. Signal sends to Signal contacts natively and non Signal contacts via SMS or MMS as appropriate.   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a XL **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.3.12","closed","","caitsith01","2021-02-09T09:54:45Z","2021-06-01T09:10:33Z"

This update introduced a new UI look for the Giphy component that shows more tiles. This change also appears to have introduced a different way GIF results are returned. The GIF results are now very often not relevant or poor matches for the search term. Comparing the same search term on the Giphy website to the Giphy integration in Signal highlights this difference.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Search ""what is love"" in Signal GIF functionality 2. Search ""what is love"" in Giphy website  **Actual result:** Results differ greatly between the two, the Giphy site has the more relevant results, which are for the Haddaway ""What is Love"" song. Signal Giphy has none of the same relevant images. **Expected result:** Signal Giphy search should mimic the results on the Giphy website, which are the most relevant to the search term  ### Screenshots None  ### Device info Not applicable  ### Link to debug log Not applicable","closed","","altmank","2021-05-12T21:05:08Z","2021-05-12T21:36:23Z"

This is similar to #4874 except that it seems like fewer people are experiencing it, and I don't know why.  Note that Signal does not ever set https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Browser#EXTRA_CREATE_NEW_TAB but that near as I can tell it doesn't need to because it removes EXTRA_APPLICATION_ID. However, I do not have this problem with *any other app* on my phone, including other chat apps, so I do think this will need to get fixed by Signal, not by Android or Chrome.  ### Steps to reproduce - open a link from Signal - leave the browser tab for that link open - open a different link from Signal - observe that you cannot find the browser tab from the first link, anymore - repeat this process, note you can only ever find the link you just opened, all others are gone.  **Actual result:** Only the last clicked link has a browser tab. **Expected result:**  Clicking multiple links results in multiple browser tabs, one with the page from each link  ### Screenshots I don't think this is something I can usefully demonstrate with a screenshot   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** Android 11 Build RQ1A.201205.003 (ie Android December 5, 2020 security update) **Signal version:** 5.1.9  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/b83615b6dd50a5ced97644783c9738807103036e5a1d0db2e775cf9d897172ad (though I find it unlikely this will be helpful)","closed","wontfix,","laurencebgood","2021-01-17T01:59:14Z","2022-06-04T16:44:05Z"

This exposes users in high-risk scenarios (e.g street protests to either resist or support a change of government) to being unmasked unless Google only gets a connection from the Signal server and never from the user's device(is this the case by any chance?) Just proving someone installed Signal might be an issue in some courtroom when an arrested person's encrypted phone successfully resists attempts to unlock it.  In addition, ANY use of Recaptcha provides Google with a captive labor source to promote their self-driving cars. It is further known the web browser usages of Recaptcha transmit a great deal of information stored in browsers to Google, especially for their recent ""invisible"" version that only shows the images when a user doesn't have a browser stuffed with 3ed party cookies and other signs of heavh ad-enabled use.  Unknown what information this use transmits to Google.  Note that reverting  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/02b0800b22e2faaa1f659d34ac3bb2f44eda3631 ""Support requesting a CAPTCHA during registration. "" should fix this, as would rewriting it to use a locally hosted captcha.   **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  When Google Play Services is shut off, Signal should make no connections to Google just as it should not to Facebook or other privacy-unfriendly servers. If a captcha is needed it should be locally provided and locally hosted, or provided by a server that is at least as secure and at least as private as Signal's own servers.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Blu C5L **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 5.3.12  ### Link to debug log  None, this was over a day ago when I set Signal up","closed","","lukefromdc","2021-02-19T23:53:57Z","2022-03-29T07:40:52Z"

I believe that WhatsApp uses the `apple-touch-icon-precomposed` 114x114px icon while Signal loads the 32x32px `shortcut icon`. Furthermore, see that the previews posted from Signal Android and Signal Desktop differ. The one from Signal Desktop looks correct.   On a side note, I'd like to mention two more things:  1. A 32x32 icon should not be displayed this large. A lot of space taken up by something looking very unpleasant.  2. The link preview is just WAY TOO BIG. If it is intended to look like this, I think you have to find a way to indicate to the user before sending that this massive thing will appear. Certainly many people will like to avoid this.  ### Screenshots  Sent from Signal Android  --- Sent from Signal Desktop  --- WhatsApp ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45139485/106400216-68cc9800-641d-11eb-84e9-4364d733c1c7.png)    ### Device info  Device: Galaxy S7 Android version: 8.0.0 Android Signal version:** 5.3.10 Desktop Signal Version:1.39.6   ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","GitMatze","2021-01-31T23:17:52Z","2022-02-03T02:22:05Z"

And no pattern / PIN / password prompt appears. Maybe it worth mentioning that even though I have seen this unlock screen many times, I've almost never had to tap since it was self-unlocking after a second or so.  The issue first happened after updating Signal from version 5.4.7 to version 5.4.12.  #### Some context  I should also say that I don't have play services installed. Back in 2017 when I first installed Signal I remember that I was asked something regarding this, but I don't remember exactly what (maybe if I want to use the app without play services?!). Anyway, I can see the 'Background connection enabled' sticky notification and I was updating the app using Yalp Store until about 1-2 years ago when I discovered that you provide the APK directly on your website (and I manually check - since I rarely connect to WiFi networks - from time to time if new versions were released).  The device do not have a fingerprint reader (or other biometric authentication features).  #### Steps to reproduce - Make sure the Signal 'Screen lock' setting is enabled. - Choose 'Pattern', 'PIN' or 'Password'. - Go to your device settings and select 'Pattern', 'PIN' or 'Password' for 'Screen lock'. - Wait for the time defined at 'Screen lock inactivity timeout' to pass or manually lock Signal. - Open Signal. - The 'TAP TO UNLOCK' message is presented. - Try to unlock the app by tapping the screen.  **Actual result:** - No pattern / PIN / password prompt appears and the app is never unlocked; the conversations list cannot be accessed.  **Expected result:** - I should be asked to enter my pattern / PIN / password - After a successful authentication the app should be unlocked and the conversations list should be presented.  #### Screenshots  ![locked2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60218583/120243757-1c7d5180-c271-11eb-9692-38b20578945f.jpg) ![locked1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60218583/120243793-31f27b80-c271-11eb-9eb0-0da7e7bafb6b.jpg) This might only be a theming issue, but for the Light theme the 'TAP TO UNLOCK' text is not visible.  #### Device info  - **Device:** Samsung Galaxy Note 3 LTE (SM-N9005) - **Android version:** rooted Android 4.4.2 with various system apps (like play services) uninstalled - **Signal version:** 5.11.5  #### App state  - Signal messages and calls registered, SMS and MMS disabled, PIN created  #### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/da41062075608535915c1bf95a4bb106812b97313bc26e328b818c2a77e215a9","closed","wontfix,","floss4good","2021-05-27T20:59:19Z","2022-05-11T10:05:06Z"

For groups like ours that have users like me that aren’t capable of switching to the new groups, this effectively means they are excluded from group chats altogether. Oddly, users with outdated Signal clients don’t get this message and can still post in old groups, creating the paradox situation that an old client has an advantage over a newer one.  Please note that I’m fully aware that I’m basically posting a duplicate of (my own) issue 11176. I’m opening this new one because the whole thing is obviously a regression. Previously it was **never** mandatory to update a group: the pop-up appeared on the top of the screen and you could just click it away, which was fine and which is what should be restored IMHO. The pop-up blocking the input field is not only unnecessary but it nudges people into unnecessary action as well, since the (old-versioned) group just works fine for everyone, and we can perfectly live with not updating it. That group has a good reason for sticking with the old version: there are users like me whose phones are too old for recent Signal versions and thus are stuck with old ones, and yet we want to include them in the group chats. As I said, this has been working perfectly fine, only the pop-up placement is the problem. If there is actually a _technical_ reason to put the pop-up there, please explain it to me, because I fail to see one and there was none given in either the FAQ or the Signal blog. If there is some kind of roadmap regarding the group migration, it would be (or, at this point rather: have been) nice to make that official and visible for the sake of transparency and preparation.  To be perfectly clear: I’m not seeking support for my outdated Android phone or its outdated Signal version. I’m asking you to fix the regression so that old groups can chat again.  ### Steps to reproduce - Update to a recent mobile or desktop version of Signal - Go to a group using the old group version  **Actual result:** The group update pop-up message blocks the message input field for everyone. Reacting to messages with emojis or replies isn’t possible. **Expected result:** The group update pop-up message should be placed in a spot that doesn’t make the group chat unusable. Reactions should work again as before.  ### Device info **Device:** Fairphone FP1U **Android version:** 4.2.2 **Signal version:** 4.36.2 (the last one supported on Android 4.2)","closed","","mgrobarek","2021-04-10T16:06:11Z","2021-05-20T14:58:22Z"

Signal used to just fill small portion of the TV when mirrored as it didn't support landscape video calls until today.   ### Bug description As the landscape video call support went live, everything worked perfectly on both the ends. The video call rotated perfectly on both devices but when I mirrored my screen to TV, the screen on TV is just stuck in portrait mode filling only part of the TV with a rotated video feed of the caller just in call screen. (Rest of the app mirrors perfectly in landscape)   ### Steps to reproduce -Make an individual call on Signal -Both the users are in portrait mode -I screen mirror cast my phone to TV -The video feed of the caller appear in only small portion of the TV obviously because both of us are in portrait mode. -Now, both of us rotate to landscape mode -Phone screens show the right orientation of the video feed in landscape mode. The TV is also expected to fill the entire screen. -But the screen mirror on TV wouldn't rotate and gets stuck in earlier portrait cut out with rotated image of the caller.   **Actual result:** When screen mirrored to my TV during video call, the picture on TV doesn't rotate along with the device.  **Expected result:** The picture on TV should rotate and fill the entire screen of the TV during video call.  **Key takeaways:**  -The entire signal app works well in landscape mode filling the TV screen when mirrored except calls UI.  -I assume signal is just rotating the video feed in call but not letting the phone know it's actually rotated during landscape call.  -I think it's an easy fix as I guess it's just missing to send an intent to phone asking it to switch into landscape mode in calls considering the rest of the UI works well when mirrored in landscape except calls.   ### Device info  **Device:** Should affect almost every android device. Using Android TV for mirroring if that's important. **Android version:** 9.0, 10.0 **Signal version:** 5.4.7","closed","wontfix,","rawlife56","2021-02-23T16:01:39Z","2022-02-02T20:18:03Z"

Videos look upside down on main screens when both phones rotate to the same side.  - Start a video call (phone 1 calling phone 2, NO group call) - Rotate phone 1 on the left side (so earpiece speaker is on the left and usb port is on the right) - Rotate phone 2 that receives the call also on the left side (so earpiece speaker is on the left and usb port is on the right)  **Actual result:** Phone 1 looks upside down, Phone 2 looks upside down **Expected result:** Phone 1 looks OK and Phone 2 looks OK as well **without the need of rotating further phone 2**. or phone 1.  THIS is possible if you rotate phone 2 on the opposite side, so if the phones are ""kissing"" each other on the usb port if you have both in front of you.  please see screenshots below:  ### Screenshots  **Photo 1**  User 1 calls user 2, they both rotate to the LEFT and it’s WRONG, Signal doesn’t rotate on both receiving screens, even though the selfie camera shows correct angle (little screen)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54513687/110236061-127ad980-7f34-11eb-84bc-3d87b9121653.png)  **Photo 2**  User 1 calls user 2 and when user 2 realises that something is wrong then something counter intuitive happens, **ONLY user 2 rotates the phone on the other side**, so usb connectors are effectively “kissing” each other, that’s what i meant, and now indeed it looks CORRECT.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54513687/110236074-21fa2280-7f34-11eb-90c3-d16bd5b3f4c4.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Samsung S8 SM-G950F **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.4.12  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/7a3da03e2a06caaaf27498a6081883e5963ee7262183515a780860259cee065d","closed","wontfix,","gab81","2021-03-07T10:08:47Z","2022-03-05T12:39:55Z"

If you exit the conversation  and return to it it will show the normal button at the bottom of the conversation that reads ""ENABLE SIGNAL FOR SMS""  **Actual result:** You can still send SMS messages with Signal not set as the default client **Expected result:** Upon resuming a Signal conversation it should check to see if it is still the default SMS client like it does when you open a conversation from the conversation list fragment, if it isn't the default SMS client anymore the UI should be updated to reflect that with the aforementioned ""ENABLE SIGNAL FOR SMS"" button   ### Device info  **Signal version:** 5.2.3","closed","wontfix,","bitmold","2021-01-25T16:31:37Z","2022-02-03T14:06:35Z"

On the tab that shows the sticker packs, all not previously used stickers are fully animated, and again the used ones are partially animated and the are stuck as static. Long pressing over them shows the entire animation preview  ### Steps to reproduce - Send an animated sticker - Open another conversation - Open the sticker selection widget - Go to the sticker pack tab of the previously sent sticker - Go back to the previously used sticker tab.  **Actual result:** The first time the previously used stickers tab is shown the sticker is animated, when you go to the sticker pack tab, the animation of the used stickers are shown for a a small time and stops. Going back to the previously used stickers, the animation is partial too. Closing the sticker selection widget and reopening doesn't solve the issue, after reopen the used stickers play and stop always. If the conversation is closed and reopened, or open a new one, the bug restarts now the first time the previously used stickers are shown on the selection widget are fully animated.  Note: if the selection widget is open and stickers are stuck, locking with the power button and unlocking, bring the used sticker to life but skipping frames and sometimes accelerated. If animations are ok on the selection widget (immediately after opening it) , locking and unlocking doesn't break anything.  **Expected result:** Used animated stickers should be shown fully animated like all other stickers without problems.  ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 4a (4G) **Android version:** 11 (Android security update: February 5, 2021) **Signal version:** 5.4.7  ### Video showing the issue  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1652983/112766049-0982a280-8fde-11eb-8198-fe7a9dc5a80b.mp4  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/bf1b40b784085cf093344d2bf8b30ea2a34d921eb183539ddf9d23e986a6a797","open","acknowledged,","robmv","2021-02-24T01:43:03Z","2022-06-16T14:53:07Z"

If you try to click the pop-up away by pressing Continue, you get the choice to force-update the group by kicking out the incompatible users, or you can abort the group update, which throws you back to square one because the pop-up message doesn’t go away.  ### Steps to reproduce - Update to Signal-Android 5.5.5 - Go to a group using the old group version  **Actual result:** The group update pop-up message blocks the message input field. **Expected result:** The group update pop-up message should be placed in a spot that doesn’t make the group chat unusable.  ### Screenshots ![Signal group chat edited](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70602401/113849170-80b3f580-9799-11eb-8b2d-e96bb9b2192d.jpeg)  ### Device info **Device:** Shiftphone Shift6m **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.5.5  ### Link to debug log See https://debuglogs.org/7cfe57ebbd43f86d42d7199b122aebee3980f1eee26c4386a5935ffe6aed5012","closed","","mgrobarek","2021-04-07T11:12:58Z","2021-04-07T14:15:09Z"

Instead, if I check my email, I see that I have received an email from an account they don't own: [their number]@optusmobile.com.au. This is doubly strange because neither they nor I use Optus Mobile. This email has a TXT file attached with the content of the intended SMS.  This doesn't seem to happen with other SMSs from other senders, just my partner's, for some reason.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have an iPhone with iOS 14.4 send an SMS to an Android 11 device using Signal as default messenger. - Check Signal, verify that the message has not been received. - Check email. - Find email from unknown account (eg. 0412345678@optusmobile.com.au) with attached TXT file. - Open TXT file to find content of SMS.  **Actual result:** Message arrives as TXT file in an attached email. Signal does not notify recipient that any such SMS even exists.  **Expected result:** SMS should be received normally by Signal.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S20 **Android version:** 11 (One UI version 3.0) **Signal version:** 5.3.12  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/8c336ca208aa880ac5b3bbda5425264534eadd53eeee6ba8bbc624747fa02400","closed","","CyberBismarck","2021-02-07T11:52:17Z","2021-02-10T10:17:42Z"

On the 25th of May, Signal suddenly stopped working on this device after an update. Tapping on Signal shows a blank window for a split second, then just closes.  I'm assisting a friend, so my debugging possibilities are limited. I'm reporting on his behalf. However what I know is:  - Signal stopped working on the 24th or 25th, probably after an update. Version reported installed on the device is 5.13.2 - I tried to terminate, clear the cache and restart: no change - Complete uninstall/reinstall: no change  ### Steps to reproduce - Fresh install on Asus Z010D - Signal doesn't launch  **Actual result:** Signal doesn't even launch **Expected result:** Signal working as would on previous releases.  ### Device info  **Device:** Asus Z010D **Android version:** 5.0.2 **Signal version:** 5.13.2","closed","wontfix,","wavexx","2021-05-29T10:05:10Z","2022-02-02T09:58:58Z"

I was able to mark all as read, but if I clicked on any one of them signal would crash.  When someone would send a signal message it would say ""Chat Session Refreshed"", but I couldn't open up the chat, the app would crash if I tried.  Signal was my default app, so to even receive an SMS I had to switch to Android Messages.  My solution was to uninstall signal, and not restore using a backup, so I started over.  Besides losing everything, it works as expected now.  Signal is the my default app again.  Before going nuclear, I did attempt to backup the existing chats, from the fast speed to create and small size of this backup, it was clear that my original messages were already gone.    **Does the underlying DB engine have a size limit I could have hit?**  I have been using the app for over half a decade and kept transferring messages from phone to phone.  ### Steps to reproduce - unknown  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Device info I checked and didn't have any signal updates or OS updates happen for at least a week, I don't think that was the issue. **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 (build RQ2A.210305.006) **Signal version:** 5.5.5  ### Link to debug log I didn't get this in time.","open","acknowledged,","jonfen","2021-04-02T15:32:24Z","2022-03-28T16:57:42Z"

"","10615","Signal permanently crashes after treating MMS group as a user","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description The user tried to change the color of an MMS group and the app crashed. She had recently been chatting in the same MMS group. The app now will not start. Upon trying to open it, the screen flashes white for a moment before going back to the home screen. Sometimes the ""Signal keeps stopping"" dialog box pops up (even after having closed the app). We have tried force stopping, clearing the cache, restarting the phone, and combinations of the above.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Scroll down to an MMS group - Tap on the group's icon - A toaster pop-up containing the icon, member list, and text/call options pops up (hint: how do you call an MMS group?) - Tap on the icon in the toaster pop up - A setting page shows up - Tap on the ""Chat color"" option - Select a new color  **Actual result:** The app immediately crashes and will not open again **Expected result:** There should be no option to change the group's color, and the app should not crash.  ### Commentary and hypothesis If you open the MMS group's settings by instead doing the following: - Open Signal - Scroll down to an MMS group - Tap group to open it - Tap three dots in the top right corner - Tap ""Group settings""  then you do **not** get the color options. From a lay person's perspective, it seems like tapping on an MMS group's icon incorrectly treats the group as an individual user (giving you the option to try to call the group, change its color, block it, etc.). When tapping on a Signal group's icon, it immediately opens the group settings, without showing the toaster pop-up. This would also explain the `adb logcat` logs below. When Signal attempted to change the color of the group, it corrupted the database because the group is not in fact a user, and thus does not have a UUID or phone number.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** 11 (December 5, 2020 security update) **Signal version:** 5.0.10 (persisted after update to 5.1.8)  ### Link to debug log Output from `adb logcat`: ``` 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: signal-JobRunner-1 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 4365 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.AssertionError: RecipientId::612 - No UUID or phone number! 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime:    at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientUtil.toSignalServiceAddress(RecipientUtil.java:65) 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime:    at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MultiDeviceContactUpdateJob.generateSingleContactUpdate(MultiDeviceContactUpdateJob.java:136) 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime:    at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MultiDeviceContactUpdateJob.onRun(MultiDeviceContactUpdateJob.java:120) 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime:    at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.BaseJob.run(BaseJob.java:30) 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime:    at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobmanager.JobRunner.run(JobRunner.java:86) 01-13 19:48:33.574  4365  5267 E AndroidRuntime:    at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobmanager.JobRunner.run(JobRunner.java:49) ```  The above lines repeat in the logs regularly.

This is done after reinstalling the app.     ### Steps to reproduce  - Signal app is startet  - Cell phone, connected to the mobile network, lies around untouched on the table  - No message will be sent  - No messages are received from others (no text messages, no pictures, no videos)   **Actual result:**  The Signal App uses approx. 634kB every hour. For 24 hours, 30 days, these are:  - 0.45GB data volume per month without sending or receiving a message. So my small data volume is completely overloaded and costs extra ($$$$$).  **Expected result:**  - Signal app is startet  - Cell phone, connected to the mobile network, lies around untouched on the table  - No message will be sent  - No messages are received from others (no text messages, no pictures, no videos)  - Very little data volume is used (<50MB per month) if no messages are sent / received.   On my old cell phone and after using account transfer option, the data required was about 140kb per day. However, due to a bug during account transfer, it was not possible to receive an acoustic notification of incoming messages, so i installed signal completely new.  This extreme data consumption occurred after an uninstallation and reinstallation of signal. Account synchronization when signal is disabled, Notification of new contacts is disabled  For comparison: the Telegram messenger additionally installed on the mobile phone only needs approx. With Whatsapp it was always very little. Signal uses around 120 times as much data as comparable messengers!!!   Another bug in Signal means that it is not possible to close the Signal app in the foreground via the task manager, since no more notifications will be received afterwards. As a result, the signal app must always run in the foreground and a possibly data-saving operation in the background is not possible.     ### Device info Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro Android version:** 10 QKQ1 MIUI 12.0.2 Signal version: 5.10.8","closed","wontfix,","Loopbuilder","2021-05-21T10:18:32Z","2022-02-02T08:58:59Z"

The picture looks fine if opened in fullscreen preview.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a picture - Sometimes the preview won't render correctly  **Actual result:** The preview appears mostly black/blurred **Expected result:** I should be able to see the preview correctly.  ### Screenshots ![IMG_20210222_175708.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10947344/108742129-b11c3900-7537-11eb-8d46-b31159f71993.jpg)   ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro **Android version:** 10.0 **Signal version:** 5.4.7  ### Link to debug log The picture in question was sent at 16:23 (device time). https://debuglogs.org/592b7622f8d9800904a386381ef950e359789325b75d7fc162316fee68afadec","closed","","Kwasow","2021-02-22T17:00:59Z","2021-05-06T13:43:20Z"

When I try to select text the control bar appears briefly in the top and disappears. I’m also unable to paste any text. This used to work fine before this update. This is killing me as I'm pretty much stuck with no cut/copy/paste in the composition box right now. I can't even paste text after editing it somewhere else 😢   ### Steps to reproduce - Open a conversation - Enter some text and try to select portions to cut/copy/paste - Try pasting some text  **Actual result:** Observe that it is not possible to select/cut/copy/paste text in composition box **Expected result:** It should be possible to select/cut/copy/paste text in composition box   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung SM-J111F **Android version:** 5.1.1 **Signal version:** 5.2.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/afeefd831bbcd989d08bb06b05a60b766d3f20b91cf1c71c909f21c0c770c423","closed","wontfix,","sivaraam","2021-01-18T17:54:21Z","2022-02-03T05:47:54Z"

(I'm not sure whether this is behaviour as intended or a bug. I liked the last one better because I don't look at my own messages so often, but if this is intended, I'll drop a post about it on the forum.)  ### Steps to reproduce - Update to 5.13.1 - Pick a custom chat color (not sure whether this matters, I only noticed it after I did)  **Actual result:** My messages are now a custom color and the other person's messages are now bland white. **Expected result:** My messages are bland, the other person's messages are colored.  ### Screenshots ![screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19656058/119798222-3c142300-bedb-11eb-8d2f-2c14c06ad7e4.jpg)    ### Device info  **Device:** Xiaomi Redmi 9S **Android version:** 10 **MIUI version:** 11.0.4.0 **Signal version:** 5.13.1  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/54fd8e7814560138ad75a8b7a78e89b0fc47e023a789bffc58abdd84242cd11a","closed","","Masqueey","2021-05-27T09:08:53Z","2021-06-09T02:06:02Z"

Today a mixture of a failure to send an image taken with the signal internal camera function and a false forward happened. Both message threads had the text of the forwarded message (the original one should not have this of course) and the forwarding of the image failed for whatever reason  ### Steps to reproduce - take a picture with the internal camera function of signal. Send it to recipient A - forward to recipient B   **Actual result:**  - error message appears, no image is forwarded - both recipients have a draft message of the test in the forwarded one  **Expected result:**   - no error message appears, image is forwarded with text to recipient B - no text or image should be sent or drafted for conversation A  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.4.12  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/ff6cecc32f10fa1128a38488613c6e963727880168bdd2669e2677aead115c4a","closed","wontfix,","piratenpanda","2021-03-11T09:30:53Z","2022-02-02T17:36:02Z"

Instead, it will simply notify me that I have missed a call once the caller hangs up.  This issue doesn't happen always. Sometimes the calls will come through as normal when attempting to replicate the problem, and I cannot identify any pattern that could be causing the bug to happen.  The last instance of this happened less than an hour ago. I missed a call from a user on an iPhone 11 (running iOS 14.4 and using Signal version 5.4.0.17).  I have submitted below the debug logs for both my Android 11 and their iOS 14.4 devices, taken immediately after the bug happened.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive a voice call. - Signal will give no indication that there is an incoming call. - Once the caller hangs up, Signal will announce that there has been a missed call.  **Actual result:** The user will not be notified of the call until the caller hangs up.  **Expected result:** Signal will ring as normal, and allow the user to answer the call.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S20 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.4.7  ### Link to debug log  Samsung Galaxy S20 (failed to receive the call): https://debuglogs.org/da0649264affb38dbb596e40f98f8a16b5f58daeea16708e2a09712a5b0225de  iPhone 12 (initiated the call): https://debuglogs.org/87451f2ae4325503bc921641c529d5d43857f8f831c209295644dc83eedf4653.zip","closed","","CyberBismarck","2021-02-24T11:45:44Z","2021-03-19T07:32:32Z"

The debug log below reveals that an exception is thrown on accessing the custom ringtone file. However, is used to function properly for quite some time. Oddly enough, after selecting the same file again as ringtone, notifications are shown again without issues.  ### Steps to reproduce I honestly don't know how to reproduce the loss of the file access rights. Maybe the following works: - set a custom ringtone for notifications - receive some messages - revoke access to the ringtone file for signal (But how? Renaming?) - receive some messages  **Actual result:** No notifications on incoming messages are shown and an exception is written to the log **Expected result:** I either expect the notifications to be shown no matter whether the ringtone can be accessed or not. If the file is inaccessible, a some default ringtone should be played as fallback and the users should be notified about the issued, e.g. ""Can't finde ringtone file. Has it been moved?

Specifically, it takes a long time for the rotating dotted circle to be replaced with a single checkmark. The double-checkmark appears almost instantly. This is **not** only the case for long conversations; even a group chat with a current total of 46 messages shows this problem. It does not appear to happen with specific contacts, nor does it matter whether I am sending a message in a group chat or a one-on-one chat. I also use Signal Desktop, so I can confirm that it takes a long time for the message to reach my desktop instance. Signal Desktop does not exhibit this slow behavior, and my internet connection is very fast (gigabit down/up). It does not matter whether I use wifi or mobile data. I first noticed this problem within the past week, and I use Signal daily.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open a chat in Signal - Send a message  **Actual result:** Signal successfully sends the message, eventually. This can take 1-5 minutes. This is not always the case. **Expected result:** Signal sends the message within a matter of seconds.    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10 (SM-G973F) **Android version:** 11 (G973FXXU9FUCD, RP1A.200720.012.G973FXXU9FUCD) **Signal version:** 5.10.8  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/c0e1e98bbb818507e879ae11dc405f285fa3339285e46d3123bc6dd8bcdd5d8d","closed","","sunflowerspeed","2021-05-16T11:58:50Z","2021-06-13T23:47:49Z"

It is (by far) the topmost process of the battery usage list. Since I've installed Signal, I can not even use my phone for one day without recharging it sometime in the afternoon.

Have not been able to determine a time or condition that causes it. But a message in the same conversation received later in the day will not bubble. Check: Go back into the Notification settings, tap ""Selected conversations can bubble"" and find that the conversation is no longer listed as allowed to bubble. Possibly related to receiving a message in another Signal conversation, but can't definitively confirm.  **Expected result:** Once a conversation has been allowed to bubble, new message(s) in the same conversation should open a bubble if one is not already open. You should be able to check which conversations are allowed to bubble at any time.  Other apps (Google Messages, Facebook Messenger) remember which conversations have been allowed to bubble and messages received days/weeks later will open a bubble.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 5 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.2.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1098d21038178df57d69a784ec5de56af6ae6dc3c9ac160b9361b0167bce1f00","closed","","gadgetfan10","2021-01-23T23:56:57Z","2021-06-15T17:30:23Z"

Normally, when you query contacts using `ContactsContract.RawContacts.ACCOUNT_TYPE` you should be getting the package name associated with a contact (the app used to sync the contact, for example Google/WhatsApp/Signal) ```         /**          * The type of account to which this row belongs, which when paired with          * {@link #ACCOUNT_NAME} identifies a specific account.          * Type: TEXT          */         public static final String ACCOUNT_TYPE = ""account_type""; ``` But it seems that after adding a new contact Signal just disappears or removes all its contacts.     Uninstalling -> reinstalling the app/clearing the app data temporary fixes the issue, but it occurs again after adding a new contact.    This commit seems to have introduced the bug: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/fcc49ae7b6958777158a7daecb7a9d6797d5da97   ### Steps to reproduce  - Make sure sync is enabled for Signal and that your contacts are synced correctly - Add a new contact - Open Signal - Got to settings and manually sync Signal if auto sync is disabled - Open contacts app and open a contact that has Signal - See that it doesn't have Signal as a communication method   **Actual result:** Signal stops showing up in contacts/Signal contacts stop sync **Expected result:** Signal shouldn't stop syncing contacts/contacts shouldn't disappear    ### Screenshots  ### Bad behavior: ![Screenshot_20210426-181552_Contacts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5289630/116108180-57152c80-a6bc-11eb-8b39-62995c3b7d7f.jpg) ![Screenshot_20210426-181557_Contacts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5289630/116110356-4a91d380-a6be-11eb-83ba-8fe2ea4ca533.jpg)  ### Good behavior (after clearing the app data) ![Screenshot_20210426-181926_Contacts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5289630/116108324-7ca23600-a6bc-11eb-88b3-2c9754904964.jpg) ![Screenshot_20210426-181929_Contacts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5289630/116110331-449bf280-a6be-11eb-8422-e74b13c0b857.jpg)    ### Device info  **Device:** Galaxy S10 **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.9.3  ### Link to debug log  Logs are irrelevant, I found the line that causes this bug, I ran it and debugged it, the issue happens when adding less than 10 contacts and running sync, in my testing I added 1 contact leading me to `There are 1 unknown contacts..` log.

Log shows ""`E SignalUncaughtExceptionHandler: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.RecipientDatabase$MissingRecipientException: Failed to find recipient with ID: null`""  Downgrading to 5.2.3 (with Titanium Backup) produces the same result.  Going to _Settings > Accounts > Signal_ and re-synchronizing contacts improves the situation a bit : now Signal starts, but every Signal contact gets either a single ""[Contact] is on Signal"" or multiple ""Online chat session has been updated"" (translated from french) unread messages.  (If I send/receive messages via a linked Signal Desktop, each message sent/received generates (at least) one extra ""Online chat session has been updated"" message on the smartphone.)  Contacts display their contact list's picture, not their Signal avatar.  Tapping on any conversation crashes the application with ""`E SignalUncaughtExceptionHandler: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to get length of null array`""  Tapping ""New message"" then selecting a Signal contact crashes the application.

Third party share menu replacement apps like [Sharedr](https://sharedr.rejh.nl) do not have system privileges and can't force the read permission for the target app. The share fails.  **Expected result:**   The share sheet should show a preview of the image   Third party share menu's should be able to handle the shared image as well.  ### Screenshots  Please refer to the following example videos filed on the AOSP bug tracker for the underlying problem:   https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/176280829  Sharing a file with and without ClipData on Android 10+ https://issuetracker.google.com/action/issues/176280829/attachments/32033725?download=true https://issuetracker.google.com/action/issues/176280829/attachments/32034124?download=true  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 3 **Android version:** Android 11 **Signal version:** 5.0.8  ## More information  Please refer to this AOSP bug tracker ticket: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/176280829  This blog article by CommonsWare explains the problem and solution: https://commonsware.com/blog/2021/01/07/action_send-share-sheet-clipdata.html","closed","wontfix,","rejhgadellaa","2021-01-08T06:43:02Z","2022-02-02T17:36:16Z"

However, I see complete non-technical people pop up (and I'll say it again, I've confirmed with them and they've never heard about Signal) in my notifications.  ### Steps to reproduce - can't really reproduce it myself... it just happens randomly, it seems?  **Actual result:** Random message about my contacts supposedly joining Signal (and they haven't). **Expected result:** Only get the notification if they indeed have already joined Signal.  ### Screenshots I don't have the notification right now, but you can see my chat list... *[redacted]*  ### Device info **Device:** One+ 6T **Android version:** 10 (Oxygen 10.3.9) **Signal version:** 5.8.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/480377deea5a18f44c54c9efb71c9931a067b6e277d763121c925a26c01c5c97","closed","wontfix,","Chinoman10","2021-04-15T13:08:49Z","2022-02-02T13:08:02Z"

This also happens if your start the camera in landscape mode and rotate to portrait. I've tested this on 3 phones, 2 have this bug,  but the third does not. a Samsung SM-A105FN.  The pictures get saved correctly.   ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Open the camera, in portrait or landscape - Rotate to landscape or portrait   **Actual result:** The preview window shows the video rotated opposite to the orientation of the phone.  **Expected result:** I expect it to work the same way, most default camera apps work, keeping the video stream locked in the preview window and just rotate the overlay icons in place around their axis to correspond to gravity.    ### Screenshots - Signal landscape preview window  ![pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107303619-18da7a80-6a88-11eb-807e-f60b6b08005c.jpg)  - default camera app landscape preview (overlay controls rotated only)   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107303942-bcc42600-6a88-11eb-9fd9-1b09ab1711fa.png)  - default camera app portrait preview   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107304034-f432d280-6a88-11eb-9c11-5c5532f7c568.png)    ### Device info  **Device and Android version:** Nokia 3.1, with Android 10  **Device and Android version:** Philips S326, with Android 5.1  **Signal version:**  5.3.12 but it also happens in 5.3.5   ### Link to debug log - Nokia with Signal v5.3.5  log: https://debuglogs.org/fce7da1c7e47bcbc947014f41b67b5f1a56fb8b08d7bd0613c55dec180755b78  - Philips with Signal v5.3.5  log: https://debuglogs.org/a917cbbcfb28140af44b1e9e460c2a5426d3e4d80557799e5343e2df22ee73cb  - Nokia with Signal 5.3.12 log: https://debuglogs.org/ba751ebace4a90e449fb6c009d42d402dbab1460e19a130ed58ed4b5e8372d98  - Philips with Signal v5.3.12 log: https://debuglogs.org/89c74b9dae7897a5125f9bd00a0b6c0712b368ff7d851667f53e09ddbb968371","closed","","clauz9","2021-02-09T01:58:13Z","2021-07-07T18:00:49Z"

When the Signal app is restricted, it can still ring for incoming calls, but doesn't show the incoming call notification, whereas other messaging apps, e.g. Threema, handle incoming calls fine in restricted mode. I've attached a debug log below, but the interesting message is only in logcat: `Service.startForeground() not allowed due to bg restriction`. Can be reliably reproduced with the steps below on Android 11.  For incoming calls Signal, unlike Threema, doesn't show a normal notification but relies on the notification passed to `startForeground` to be shown. But with background restrictions that notification won't be shown ...  **Possible solution**: Show a normal notification for incoming calls.  I have found another comment with this behavior (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8302#issuecomment-721939102), but no issue describing the exact same problem.   ### Steps to reproduce - Make sure audio notifications are enabled - Restrict background for signal (see [Android App Power Management](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/app_mgmt?hl=en) )   `adb shell appops set org.thoughtcrime.securesms RUN_ANY_IN_BACKGROUND ignore` - Open Signal app (to make sure it's running) - Go to android home screen - Call the device from another device  **Actual result:** The ring tone can be heard, but no notification is shown to accept/decline the call **Expected result:** An incoming call notification should be shown  - After hanging up the call on the calling device, the called device stops ringing and shows a missed call notification.

And after you send an actual message in the group,  the other users will receive a System notification with your message and if they expand the notification,  they can see all the group events as well.   **Expected result:** I expect group events that are received and counted by the app, to be pushed to system notifications and alert the user when he's not using the app.   ### Screenshots I've made 3 video recording with all 3 clients in all the scenarios described above.  - Video 1  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107401143-4288b580-6b0b-11eb-9a5b-12443754fb67.mp4  - Video 2  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107401502-9e533e80-6b0b-11eb-9363-c7ebef33cda5.mp4  - Video 3  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107401832-ee320580-6b0b-11eb-843e-b91bf6e2adaa.mp4  ### Device info  **Device:** The device on the left is a Samsung SM-A105FN **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.3.12 but I've tested this on 5.2.3 as well    **Device:** The device in the middle is a Nokia 3.1 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.3.12 but I've tested this on 5.2.3 as well   **Device:** The device on the right is a Philips S3326 **Android version:** 5.1 **Signal version:** 5.3.12 but I've tested this on 5.2.3 as well   ### Link to debug log - Samsung Log: https://debuglogs.org/ac76e6f3f5e8f8f80f60e1faa183df0bc82ba68369c3d8f236a19126d15f1543 - Nokia Log: https://debuglogs.org/309556291aa2e529365d25061c33c54e966771ca9b096dfc923f3bdee837aa81 - Philips Log: https://debuglogs.org/e21cb69fe9a2ac8b291ecdf78370db1278ce716d9ade40aa1f453b9a92898c58","closed","","clauz9","2021-02-09T17:33:46Z","2021-09-10T14:27:38Z"

My friends also noticed that it happens to them too, so it is not device dependent. Links are from public account images.  If you paste the same link into WhatsApp, you will get preview for Instagram login page, so it seems to be related to the new Instagram change where you can only access limited number of images from public accounts before being asked to signup.  I understand that this might not be in your power to fix, but I wanted to at least give you a heads up since it seems that this Instagram change is not yet global, it seems to be region based (maybe some A/B testing), so you might be unaware that it is happening. My region is Serbia, so if you have access to some VPN you can test it that way.  ### Steps to reproduce - Copy link to some image from any public Instagram account - Paste it in Signal conversation  **Actual result:** There will be no image preview, only ""No link preview available"" message **Expected result:** Proper image preview.  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20210427_131225_org thoughtcrime securesms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25534110/116238182-5aaebf00-a761-11eb-8c77-999650975b2b.jpg) ![Screenshot_20210427_131202_com whatsapp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25534110/116238193-5da9af80-a761-11eb-8b7a-e604bf42d4b3.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** Huawei Mate 10Pro **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.8.10","closed","wontfix,","markorakita","2021-04-27T12:05:56Z","2022-05-25T02:52:46Z"

I use Signal as my default SMS/MMS client, and when I couldn't send encrypted messages over Signal I found myself sending some unencrypted ones using my carrier. For people who I was texting that I tried to send Signal messages to and found that those messages didn't deliver, my subsequent SMS/MMS texts to them also would have the circular loading symbol on them as if they were queued up behind the Signal messages that wouldn't send. Whereas with people who I had no outstanding Signal messages I was trying to send, I could continue to use Signal as an SMS/MMS client to reach those people. Ultimately I had to switch away from Signal as my SMS/MMS client to make sure that my messages were actually reaching people.  SMS/MMS sucks in so many ways, but in the event that Signal is ever down again (or presumably the user has no access to a data connection and has outstanding Signal encrypted texts) the SMS/MMS functionality can also be broken which will confuse users.   Also thanks to everyone who worked to get Signal back online as fast as possible, I feel y'all got a lot of undeserved flack for that <3   **Actual result:** SMS/MMS texts won't send until all outstanding Signal texts have been sent. **Expected result:** I don't know, *I at least*, feel like the SMS/MMS should be queued separately or something. At least in the event that Signal is down.  ### Device info **Signal version:** 5.2.3 (I think)","closed","","bitmold","2021-01-25T16:09:23Z","2021-01-26T14:43:16Z"

While I have had this happen in a variety of different circumstances, for this bug report I was trying to nail down a particular series of steps that could be performed in order to reproduce the bug. I managed to figure out at least 1 reproducible circumstance that causes the behavior and that has not yet been reported by others.   Essentially, if you write a message (but don't send it obviously), then press the back button to return to the main Signal screen (or just press the Home button or task switcher button), and follow this up with rebooting your phone, when you return to the app after a reboot, you will see a preview of the draft message you previously authored on the main Signal screen, but when you actually click on the message, the draft message will be gone.  Possibly related to one or more of these other issues concerning disappearing draft messages: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9228 https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9740 https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9413 https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7649 https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7612  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Click on any existing thread you desire - Write a message but do not send it - Click the back button once or twice such that you return to the main Signal screen (or alternatively, just click your Home button or hit the task switcher button and switch to another app) - Reboot your phone - After reboot, open Signal - Look for thread you previously authored the draft message in and notice that you will see a preview of that saved draft message (see screenshot below) - Click on that thread and once it opens, you will see that the saved draft message you just saw a preview of no longer exists  **Actual result:** The saved draft message is deleted and no longer exists. **Expected result:** The text box should contain the draft message you previously authored and just saw a preview of before clicking on the thread.  ### Screenshots ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4186018/115166891-ff9f0d00-a07a-11eb-8158-684b1bb20625.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 7 Pro (GM1917) [12GB RAM + 256GB ROM] **Android version:** 10 (Oxygen OS 10.3.8.GM21AA) **Signal version:** 5.7.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/691c064bf6253cea3aa43cd8fbeafda3a441c673a5ea76e104ba96f6e09e5e56","closed","wontfix,","lahma0","2021-04-19T00:31:01Z","2022-02-02T15:36:07Z"

All that I could hear was a random sound breaking at every single second. Like ""A.a.a.a...aa......a.a.a...a......z..f..v..a.a.............a..a.""   Can you blame me for my bad internet and turning on ""relay calls""?  No. I've set up 50Mbps WiFi which works flawlessly for me.So, relaying calls. Shouldn't be a problem as I didn't find any issues on my pc.  ### Steps to reproduce - Call a person - talk to them - Hear to them.  **Actual result:** There should be no voice breaks or stutters.   **Expected result:** Calls are bloated with stutters and voice breaks.  ### Screenshots It was an audio which couldn't be recorded.   ### Device info **Device:** Nokia 6.1 Plus DRG **Android version:** 10.0 **Signal version:** 5.9.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/c348a44482a2c7fd3b4f55cfa9fc35c5a1f98b9f728478f6460949ffc1ef6e93","closed","wontfix,","pixincreate","2021-04-22T16:53:36Z","2022-02-01T23:32:24Z"

Verify PIN works correctly because it expects the new pin. Unlocking with pin (skip biometrics) still requires me to enter old pin 😭.  I suspect that removing the pin altogether from the advanced settings would resolve the issue, but I have avoided doing so because I would like to do what I can to get this fixed.   ### Steps to reproduce - PIN is disabled - set a pin - lock signal and unlock it with the pin (sanity check) - go and change your pin - close signal, or whatever it takes to get Verify PIN to pop up - Enter in new pin. It should accept it - Lock Signal - Attempt to unlock with new PIN   **Actual result:** New PIN does not unlock signal, but old pin does **Expected result:** Old PIN should not unlock signal; new PIN should.    ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 4 **Android version:** Android 11 RQ1A.201205.008 **Signal version:** 5.0.8 (but originally started happening on an older version. not sure which)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/03099f5db89e2cd48ff99e42452cb162e39f447dfcacb364bc9da4eb6afb7ac7 I'm not sure if this log is relevant because whatever issue occurred has most likely occurred a long time ago, once, and it has left my Signal in a bad state.  This one may be more interesting.

Possibly related: #7560, #9136, #9154, #10053, #9867, #9808, #9756 (unlikely), #9398, #9394, #9327, #9302, #9177  If one of these match, feel free to close this as duplicate. I have three different backup files with three different behaviors, so I wasn't sure which of these to add to, nor how to interpret the logs to figure out if my situation is actually a duplicate.  ### Steps to reproduce - turn on backups on signal, store 30 digit passphrase - mount phone via USB via `simple-mtpfs` and copy backup file(s) using `cp` to linux laptop on btrfs - factory reset phone - copy a backup file back to `/Phone/Signal/Backups/file` - install signal - grant permissions, then attempt to restore backup file  **Actual result:** I have three signal backups. I first enabled backups on 2020-07-23 in preparation to factory reset (phone feeling laggy), but it took me until more recently to backup everything else and actually do it. I also have backups from 2021-01-02 and 2021-01-03 which were auto-generated by signal since I left backups enabled. I copied these over on 2021-01-03 before my factory reset on 2021-01-04.  Results are: - 2020-07-23: texts restored as expected - 2021-01-02: accepts passphrase, counts to ~56k messages, then says ""incorrect passphrase"" and stays at restore screen - 2021-01-03: accepts passphrase, counts to ~56k messages, then crashes/closes  This isn't the *worst* thing ever, but I lost ~5mos of texts as-is.  **Expected result:** any chosen backup file would restore as expected.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung S8 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 5.0.8  ### Link to debug log - 2020-07-23 (successful): [signal log](https://debuglogs.org/98a5ac48d74468ce493e8a3ee3dca030b974c633376bea34cb99ffdc03cdc9dc), `adb logcat` [gist](https://gist.github.com/jwhendy/c1f7e72275ec9f03a7b950040cbfb166) - 2021-01-02 (bad passphrase after counting): [signal log](https://debuglogs.org/4e485b0bbdd458a2af8281066d508b5bcd14cbfd42e88ec555c6b8ca72152a81), `adb logcat` [gist](https://gist.github.com/jwhendy/7cd4136bb16f6b4cc6e0b86dc700e273) - 2021-01-03 (crash after counting): can't capture signal, `adb logcat` [gist](https://gist.github.com/jwhendy/87ac269fde95bec3d4f2a859f5a669a9)","open","backup,","jwhendy","2021-01-09T18:30:58Z","2022-08-01T13:01:00Z"

While I am able to send messages to someone else, and they receive them, their response will not be received.  I have to exit the app and reenter it at least once, in order for all the groups to be loaded, and all the messages that I should've received before to appear one after the other.   Also I've noticed that if you exit Signal and do not reenter it immediately, you will receive Android notifications for all past messages only if someone sends you a new message in the time that you are outside Signal, if not, there's no activity, until you reenter the app.   I've tested this on 3 devices, and I think it is related to this issue #7642,  I see it has been closed because it could not be replicated, hopefully the steps bellow will help.  ### Steps to reproduce - install Signal from Play Store or APK - Open it and register normally. - Type in the pin, reach main screen - DO NOT EXIT THE APP, OR ALLOW THE PHONE TO LOCK - Use another phone to send messages to the newly installed Signal - Wait...  **Actual result:**  You will not receive messages or load saved groups until you exit and reenter the app at least once.  **Expected result:**   You should be able to receive messages and have the saved groups loaded soon after you enter the app, the first time.  ### Screenshots ![pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77681918/107291123-516e5a00-6a70-11eb-96b4-892b7965fb22.png)    ### Device info  **Device and Android Version:**                  Philips S326, with Android 5.1 **Device and Android Version:**          Nokia 3.1, with Android 10 **Device and Android Version:**           Samsung  SM-A105FN, with Android 10 **Signal version:** All the devices above were running 5.3.12, but I've tested this on 5.3.5 as well.   ### Link to debug log  ### NOKIA 3.1 - before: https://debuglogs.org/ddbb10683bf50881df4aab411c1633e0b1538495061e92c2f5c7573924caf5fa - after: https://debuglogs.org/8b327b2a7dba90d69f0476b2c564f439dc8c37ca779ace7cb96108b1cd9b9485  ### Philips S326 - before: https://debuglogs.org/853200bc3d0be3aae8f86d5e916ffbfd78ca7874b4eda98db8e4c862f4d0669a - after: https://debuglogs.org/a8d109a6c8fc89a14aea999a8d3a8c6d70e3d17061892b84bb7e6a40d5db3991  ###  Samsung  SM-A105FN - before: https://debuglogs.org/3143175869c9afa044be51a8637cb78414ae23cc4dc52224f72a8f86845698fd - after: https://debuglogs.org/2f73c8a6ac76b95b531d463d4b4862ace5cba61c35f071cf9804534652c11a74","closed","","clauz9","2021-02-08T22:59:50Z","2021-03-18T15:54:29Z"

I know it is not used by signal but I was expecting my PIN to be accepted since I have not explicitly set any from the app after installing.

Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of them. Recipient phones are pretty much unusable during the assault. When the assault finally ends, each recipient is faced with a conversation overwhelmed with these utterly useless alerts. At least one recipient had enabled Conversation Length Limit, so they lost *all* old messages and the photos they'd wanted to keep. Then, when the recipients want to get rid of these thousands of alerts they discover that Signal provides no means to accomplish this aside from manually selecting one at a time. One at a time. Thousands of them.  I tried to use the offered Contact Us associated with these alerts, but that doesn't work properly either. It just gets in an endless loop where one tries to send the message and it returns to the same form for submitting the same message again. Click Next, repeat ad nauseum. Did my submission go through? I have no idea.  Yes, I am aware of bug report #10887, but that one relates the problem to using the desktop Signal application and no one has ever even installed that application in this case.  ### Steps to reproduce No idea. Given the data loss and expansive denial of service this caused, none of us want to repeat this experience. Signal may need to be replaced if it isn't compatible with traversing time zones (or whatever the issue is).  **Actual result:** Make Signal completely unusable for the lengthy duration of the assault. Make the phone unusable too, unless one disables Wi-Fi and data, although the assault resumes after regaining Internet connectivity. Fills conversations with thousands of useless alert messages that the recipient cannot act upon other than to spend an inordinate amount of time deleting. Data loss for some users.  **Expected result:** I expect never to receive ""chat session refreshed"" alerts. Why would I? I expect never to see user alert messages that are uninformative. When an alert is necessary but is repeating, I expect only *one* alert summarizing the problem. I do expect alert messages to count against the user's conversation length limit. I expect to have a simple method for the user to delete a block of alerts without having to select each and every one of them.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.5.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/f8775b813dd9fe16528f24c3cef90b322d700df233a0e930c768a736ee9a5448  I won't be collecting debug logs from all the other recipients of this mess.","closed","wontfix,","alcoolfire","2021-04-05T23:23:19Z","2022-02-02T01:05:42Z"

My individual messages mostly work with him except there are multiple threads that seem to alternate depending on if a picture/gif was sent or not (e.g. message incoming chat 1, one of us send MMS and now messages coming in one chat 2). I also tried to fix by setting signal as default SMS app and the signal threads were still there under his name then a third new message thread under ""unknown"" was opened.   I think there is an issue with his phone number and my signal. N uses Google Fi if that matters. I use ATT. We both have pixel 3a. I have no issues with other contacts that also have pixel 3a. Don't for sure know anyone else that has Google Fi.  ### Steps to reproduce  **Group Chat Crash** - open app - Open group message - press chat bubble to begin typing message or start typing a couple letters **Actual result:**  Either boots back to the main conversation list or crashed app **Expected result:** Let me type my message to the group   **Individual Contact Chat Shenanigans**  Double Threads - Write message to N in thread 1 - converse in thread 1 - one of us sends a picture - messages move to thread 2 - send another picture - messages move back to thread 1 **Actual result:**  two individual message threads for this one contact **Expected result:** One individual message thread for this one contact  Can't see specific contact ""N"" messages in any groupchat - Contact ""N"" writes message - do not see it show up - another contact in the same groupchat replies to ""N"" - I see other other contacts message reply like normal with reply message and N's message along with ""couldn't find original message"" **Actual result:**  Cannot receive group messages from contact ""N"" **Expected result:** receive group messages from contact ""N""  Default SMS App - set signal as default SMS app - new thread created with SMS texts (sms app: google messages) from N labeled as ""unknown"" - now there are 3 threads for N (N individual signal message thread 1, N individual signal thread 2, and ""unknown"" thread with SMS texts) **Actual result:**  signal does not properly import N's contact information and imports N's google message SMS messages into an ""unknown thread"". Does not connect with signal contact N which has same phone number **Expected result:** 1 thread for 1 contact  ### Screenshots  ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130000-14c7c800-5a9b-11eb-9c78-b14224c94500.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130011-18f3e580-5a9b-11eb-8da6-fd6dfb0f8c01.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130018-1abda900-5a9b-11eb-91d9-37508efee7e9.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130072-345ef080-5a9b-11eb-9317-3b54978f73f3.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_006](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130075-35901d80-5a9b-11eb-9611-8ea8d3112488.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130076-3628b400-5a9b-11eb-9bb0-b5e6741f0b4b.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_008](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130078-3628b400-5a9b-11eb-909a-40b88ea527d3.png) ![signal-2021-01-19-204114_004](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77546056/105130079-36c14a80-5a9b-11eb-89a3-c0baee67d672.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.2.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/d357927762ab431a2486c9270e310d05bb36ad8baa0df65b47b731967947d96e>","closed","wontfix,","FriendlessD","2021-01-20T05:28:07Z","2022-02-02T08:58:54Z"

I'm not sure if this is the fault of Signal or the file managers, but in either case,  I'm submitting this issue in case others are facing the same problem.  **TL;DR:** If you're facing the same issue as described below, use Simple File Manager (available on F-droid) to browse for your backup file.  ### Steps to reproduce  - Open clean install of Signal - Press `Restore backup` - Press `Choose backup` - Select backup file with your file manager of choice  **Actual result:** Signal silently skips to the ""Enter phone number"" screen. **Expected result:** Signal should confirm the size of my backup and prompt me for my passphrase.  ### Additional notes  The above behavior has been observed with the following file managers: - OnePlus File Manager (com.oneplus.filemanager) - Xiaomi File Manager (com.mi.android.globalFileexplorer)  In addition to this, *Files by Google* doesn't even show up as an option in the `Complete action using...` dialog.

I tried to wait a couple of days hoping the backup starts automatically, but no.  There are other bug reports describing a similar problem caused by the inability to write on the external SD card. I tried to eject the external SD card, but with no effect.  Looking into the debug log shows _no_ entries regarding backups.  Background-Info:   I had Signal 4.49 installed on an older Galaxy Note 4, switched to a new phone (same Signal identity) and I now wanted to make a backup from that old installation.

After some time I asked another thing and the missing message was delivered (see screenshots and timestamps).   - Second scenario was that a message was not received by me until the sender wrote a second message.   - Third scenario was that the message was received on all devices by me after I opened the desktop client approximately a day later.  The missing messages were also not delivered after the android app or phone was restarted. **Note**: The message was not delivered in the windows client as well for scenario one and two. It seems to be a server issue.  Probably similar to this one: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10693  ### Steps to reproduce - don't know  **Actual result:** Messages are sometimes not received. **Expected result:** Messages are received. At least when the app was restarted.

My brother recently sent me a picture that was intended for another contact, he said he was quite sure he selected the right contact and that it had happened before, but we sort of shrugged it of. Since then, he has been extra careful and observant when sharing pictures. Just now, it happened again, and this time he is 100% sure he chose the correct contact. I told him to immediately create a debug log, so now I'm filing this bug for him. I would say this is a big deal. It is hardly a problem for my brother and his contacts, but it's not difficult to imagine this causing major problems.  ### Steps to reproduce - Find a picture in your gallery app, choose share -> signal - Contacts appear, pick ContactA - the Picture appears in preview mode, full screen, so the rest of the chat is not visible, however my brother states (as he is being extra careful) he consciously noted the text ""*Message to ContactA*"" in the (empty) message text box. - Hit send - After hitting send, the fullscreen preview with the ""*Message to ContactA*"" text box is presented again, and can not be easily left. Apparently the back-button needs to be rapidly tapped to leave this screen. A single 'back' will just re-show it.  At this point my brother gets a thank you for the picture from ContactB, not the intended recipient of he message. And indeed, the picture now shows in the conversation with ContactB, and ContactA has not received anything.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung S9 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 5.3.12  ### Link to debug log The message that was unintentionally sent to ContactB has timestamp 15:23:46 https://debuglogs.org/3a2a606e1dd0710fe6b95ee6f93500103aaa37c35abe7e3248aefa8debc76318","closed","wontfix,","bepaald","2021-02-13T15:18:39Z","2022-02-02T21:28:02Z"

The crash began after I was composing a message to said person in the old conversation at the exact same time she re-registered her Signal account.  ### Steps to reproduce - Person A and Person B become Signal users, Person A uses an Android 11 device, while Person B uses an iOS device (though B's device may or may not matter in this situation). - Person B unregisters Signal account later on, as a result, Person A uses SMS to communicate to person B (still through the Signal app). - While Person A composes a message to Person B through SMS, Person B decided to register for Signal again. As a result, Person A is kicked out of the conversation and sees a new conversation with a message like ""Session reset"". - If Person A taps on the old conversation, the app immediately crashes.  **Actual result:** App crashes **Expected result:** The conversation should load and you should be able to view the messages  ### Device info **Device:** Oneplus 7T **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 5.9.5 (Bug occurred in previous version as well)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1d256b8108a8ba66119c7ae4dee512ed7d68d57a013fb045c87cb1812ccf6519  ### Other things to note The old conversation loads fine on Signal Desktop (flatpak, GNU/Linux), just without the SMS messages of course.","closed","","alexrelis","2021-05-05T05:56:26Z","2021-05-07T21:07:23Z"

I just tried submitting the same file from a desktop client and it was flagged as >100MB and denied for sending. Looking at the file size it seems to be somewhere at the border of permissible file sizes and it seems that different Signal clients handle this size differently (possibly with different units e.g. MB vs MiB). Since the file is allowed on the Android client and it is probably not allowed in the same unit on the Signal server, this could explain why the upload is hanging forever once it reaches 100%. It could be that the client-server communication goes in some unhandled way where the server denies the upload but the client does not know how to handle this.  ### Steps to reproduce - get a file of size of about 100MB, as close to the one above as possible - share the file through the Signal Android client  **Actual result:** the upload will hang forever now **Expected result:** the upload should succeed *or* Signal should not allow the file to be uploaded on the first place, having identical behaviors independently of the platform  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Manufacturer Model XVI **Android version:** 5.0.8 **Signal version:** 0.0.0  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/f696b9ade701027b4d8e309e280e2c3062d497b7231cc42c3a98a75591c6de0b","closed","wontfix,","pevogam","2021-01-12T11:06:44Z","2022-04-07T01:23:02Z"

It's confusing, unexpected and can lead to strange situations. Moreover, it emphasizes the order in which emojis arrive  which is counterintuitive when grouping (because the entire point of grouping is to abstract away from the information about the individual emojis.)   I just encountered this in a group where 7 people used tone A ""thumbsup"" emoji and then one person used tone B and then the badge changed to B. This was surprising and unexpected, in particular if B is is not the neutral tone. Some people in the group who commented on this considered this a bug.   Moreover, the badge shown was inconsistent between the participants because of the rule that it depends on your own choice. I think strictly speaking, one could even make the point that this is a unnecessary violation of a security property load because different users will disagreements over what the state is. (Sure, we live in an   asynchronous world, so we can't reach this property... But here all messages have arrived, so we don't need to violate agreement.)  I suggest that grouping for the badge either  * always uses the neutral/yellow tone (That is less surprising because the tone will never change but it's still surprising when there's only a single tone different from the neutral one), or  * uses the unique tone if there's one and uses the neutral tone when there's one than one tone present in the set. (That still means the tone can change but it changes at most once.)  I'd prefer the second option.","closed","wontfix,","real-or-random","2021-03-01T16:28:33Z","2022-02-02T19:17:46Z"

Sending messages using only a physical keyboard is a relevant use case for accessibility (people who can't or have difficulties touching the screen) or UX (faster typing), but currently Signal does not _really_ allow this. The alternative of enabling option ""Enter key sends"" has the side effect of preventing the user from entering line breaks in the message. It is also possible to use tab-cycling as a workaround, but it is not very practical for now (see [#2](#2-sending-messages-and-tab-cycling)).  While Android apps don't have an universal standard for this use case (see [#1](#1-behavior-of-other-messaging-and-related-apps)), Ctrl+Enter seems to be the best approach because:  - It does not break any existing behavior (even undocumented ones) or user expectations; - Allows the user to have both behaviors and can be overridden by ""Enter to send"" option if the user wants; - Same keybinding used by Telegram, Gmail and possibly others; - Does not require new settings; - Does not seem to have any negative impact on a11y; - Among the options, it seems to have the lowest impact on code (a single line changed, seriously); - No perceivable impact on performance; - No new requirements for API levels (`KeyEvent.isCtrlPressed()`is stable since API Level 11, Android 3).   Of course, comments are welcome.       ----------   ### Footnotes  #### 1. Behavior of other messaging and related apps  For reference, follow the behaviors I tested in a few other communication apps (all on Android).   - Telegram: Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter sends the message. Tab changes focus to the message history, so user the scroll through them with the keyboard, but focus never reaches the send button. - Gmail:  Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter sends the email. - Android 7 SMS app (ver 2.1.163): Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter does nothing. Tab sends focus to ""Add MMS media"", a second Tab to the emoji button, focus never reaches the send button. - Android 9 SMS app (ver 5.0.052): Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter does nothing. Tab sends focus to ""Add Contact"", a second tab puts the focus on send button; Pressing Enter with the send button in focus sends the SMS and put focus back to input line automatically. - Skype: Enter sends the message, Ctrl+Enter adds a new line. - Google Meet: Enter always adds a new line (Ctrl+Enter does nothing). Send by keyboard requires a tab to focus in the send button, after that the user needs to tab-cycle through to all other controls to get back to the input line. - Jitsi Meet: Enter always sends the message, Ctrl+Enter does nothing. Tab puts the send button on focus, once user presses Enter the message is sent and focus is lost (the only way to put the focus on the input line again is touching the screen). - Mattermost: Both Enter and Ctrl+Enter sends the message. Shift+Enter adds a newline.   #### 2. Sending messages and tab cycling  On Signal 5.3.12, pressing tab from the input line will put a invisible focus in the send button so user can send the message with Enter after that. However, focus does not return to the input line automatically and user needs to tab-cycle through all other controls to get it back there, and not all controls give feedback on their focus. An advanced user may notice that after the Enter to send the message, focus will fall (invisibly) in the return button and pressing it will back to the chat list with the most recently used one pre-selected, and pressing Enter again will open this chat with the input line in focus. There is a bit of timing for this as the end button takes a few milliseconds to give focus up and, so, two immediate Enters will cause the second one to try to send an empty message, so user must stay aware to this.

If the user chooses to install a second contacts list, it would be useful for the Signal Messenger instance installed on the primary profile to hide (i.e not display) message threads that contain recipients who's phone numbers are saved in the second profile's contact list when the second profile is in the hidden state. When the profile is reactivated, all message threads should be visible again.  I have created a short video to demo the feature: https://youtu.be/XJAmEFbasxQ  It is important to note that on the Android system IPC across profiles is limited to activities. We added an invisible activity to Signal to allow BatApps to notify it when to update the ConversationsListFragment.  BatApps also provides the user configurable options for when to hide the profile, for example every time the device's screen is turned off or after a certain time since they last activated the profile. The basics are described in this video: https://youtu.be/GqTq8GHORUo  I would be happy to discuss any feedback you may have or the possibility of future integrations.

Currently, when generating a link preview, Signal will load an image provided by a remote website and, if under a simple 2 MB file size limit, accept, recompress, store on local chat history and then send it to the receivers. These images can be much larger than actually required by the intended application, wasting storage and bandwidth. The problem is exacerbated when sending link previews to large groups due to amplification effects.  Limiting the size of these images is also important as they will accumulate on receiver's chat history and is not unrealistic to expect an user to collect a few thousand link previews on long lived chat sessions or, more commonly, on group chats. Deleting them from the media list, which a typical user may be tempted to do after seeing several large but apparently unused files there, will cause the original message to be deleted too, so this approach may not be always desired.  Taking the page https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oxford_Tolkien.JPG as an example: current stable version (v5.3.12) generates a 1200x1800px thumbnail of 359 KB. With the changes proposed here, this thumbnail is scaled down to 341x512px, resulting in a JPEG file of only 38 KB and still with enough quality to be used in the preview.  The 512x512 px limit is mostly based on the current recommendation for stickers and seems acceptable for this context. It gives enough resolution for a good presentation, while a larger image won't necessarily give more information to the user. Opinions on this are welcome, of course.","closed","wontfix,","ittner","2021-02-06T18:57:37Z","2022-07-06T21:32:36Z"

However this is not the expected behavior for the two jobs where it is currently used: `GroupCallPeekWorkerJob` and `AutomaticSessionResetJob` For both the expected behavior is that there aren't too many jobs of them queued, but that there will be at least one instance of them queued. Both of them use the same queue as the `PushProcessMessageJob` and the `MarkerJob`. Those two jobs are often in the queue at the same time, effectively preventing the `GroupCallPeekWorkerJob` and `AutomaticSessionResetJob` from being enqueued.

This issue is especially severe for incoming calls, which fail because the request to retrieve the turn servers fails and isn't retried, see for example #10787  This PR configures a custom okhttp connection pool with keep alive of 1 minute, so no stale connections should be reused, under stable network conditions.

They can still be found in the NewConversationActivity, but the behavior is confusing for users and also inconsistent with the other apps, e.g. Signal-Desktop doesn't delete a thread if all its messages are deleted. The user can already delete a conversation thread explicitly, so there's no need to automatically delete the conversation thread when its last message is deleted.  There are several reports about this unexpected behavior, and also in the Play Store comments: https://community.signalusers.org/t/deleting-all-messages-in-a-chat-removes-it-from-the-list/25537 #8406 #10054 #10100 #10586 #11399   This PR prevents empty threads to be deleted/hidden and also prevents empty threads to be created when opening the ManageRecipientActivity of a new contact. - Removed the `MESSAGE_COUNT != 0` checks from `ThreadDatabase` - Adapted `ThreadDatabase` to not automatically delete empty threads - Adapted `ManageRecipientRepository` to not create an empty thread if it doesn't exist yet  This PR is a minimal implementation of the feature,  if you're interested in it, I can clean it up further: - Remove the now unused column MEANINGFUL_MESSAGES/message_count from the thread database - Add a migration to delete threads without meaningful messages, that are currently hidden. So the user doesn't get overwhelmed with threads with people she never chatted with.","closed","wontfix,","AsamK","2021-05-29T20:48:27Z","2022-04-13T10:36:15Z"

Seems to me this fix is not needed anymore, and it's causing significant overhead to the app. This is because every time the conversations list is rendered, it queries the megaphone table twice. And it also makes the megaphone caching useless.  My guess is that when the megaphones' state was stored in the main database, after restoring a backup in a newer version of the app, this fix was needed to sync such state with the megaphones (the ""event"" list) defined in new release. Now that the megaphones are not part of the backups anymore, the task that calls init() in the megaphone repository constructor should keep the state initialized in all cases.","closed","","valldrac","2021-04-22T17:26:50Z","2021-04-27T14:58:52Z"

Another possibility to reach a point where eveything is coherent would have been to just remove the Math.max(..., 60) that ignored seconds.  The duration will be displayed as ""xx:xx:00"" to make it clear that xx:xx represents minutes.  Fixes #10788.

This option is useful for users who keep in touch only with a set of known contacts, and don't want to receive any messages from someone else. It's a sort of allow-list for security, anti-spam, or just convenience for small teams or communities. Many users have requested this feature in the forum.  The incoming messages from unknown senders are just ignored when this option is enabled, following the same rules as if the recipient was already blocked by the user. An ""unknown sender"" is a recipient that it's not present in the system contacts, or the user doesn't share their profile with.  I also added two more commits to fix some inconsistencies in the blocked-users preference UI. The goal is to make the fragment more like the rest of the preferences of the app (colors, font size, ripple, and padding).  ### Screenshots  | Signal v5.9.0 | This PR | |--|--| | ![Screenshot_1618940431](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10455969/115444867-6a844b80-a215-11eb-80cf-bda804cb5ca7.png) | ![Screenshot_1618939778](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10455969/115444832-60624d00-a215-11eb-899e-f36daf722bc9.png) |  | Signal v5.9.0 (Dark) | This PR (Dark) | |--|--| | ![Screenshot_1618940049](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10455969/115444841-648e6a80-a215-11eb-88ef-c8534364035f.png) | ![Screenshot_1618940262](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10455969/115444857-66f0c480-a215-11eb-9f4c-ce0491753ee9.png) |","closed","wontfix,","valldrac","2021-04-20T18:43:29Z","2022-07-06T10:42:17Z"

There are 3 commits in this PR. 1. update the blacklist method so we can blacklist by name and sdk version 2. remove all huawei/honor of the list if the sdk >28 3. house cleaning on the IdealResolution function and removed the preview resolution set manually. This preview resolution set manually was likely the problem of the Huawei not working because it forced the preview aspect ration to 16:9 or 4:3 which is not possible when the screen is Full HD. If we do not set the resolution, then CameraX automatically picks the best for us. This was tested on p20, p30 lite and pro, low and high resolution.","closed","","yan796","2021-02-22T19:33:36Z","2021-03-15T10:21:22Z"

In the method it determines the range of the data to be loaded and first [mark the range as read](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/4b2366e537ef25d3489c08b1e9a508ef9fd37074/paging/lib/src/main/java/org/signal/paging/FixedSizePagingController.java#L89), then [spawn a thread to actually load the data in the range](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/4b2366e537ef25d3489c08b1e9a508ef9fd37074/paging/lib/src/main/java/org/signal/paging/FixedSizePagingController.java#L93). In there it loads data, and stuff them in to the (possibly) existing data according to the index of the data and post the array of data to UI to show them.  The problem here is that `onDataNeededAroundIndex` is called a lot of times when we scroll and read messages. Sometimes two or more calls to `onDataNeededAroundIndex` enter in the method before a thread that loads the data starts to execute. Because we use LIFO strategy to spawn threads and execute code, the later call to `onDataNeededAroundIndex` is executed before earlier calls. But the later one sometimes has very narrow range to load data that does not even include the `aroundIndex`, because the range around `aroundIndex` was already marked as read by the earlier calls (that have not been executed to load data yet). The result of the execution is an array that consist mostly of nulls.  When the array is posted to update the UI, RecyclerView adapter gets confused because most data is null but at the end of the array there are a few items. It calls `onItemRangeInserted` that calls [`snapToTopIfNecessary`](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/2c1c6fab3560ef12996030cf7c84cc0d895e329e/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/SnapToTopDataObserver.java#L113) and we see the chat suddenly jumps to the more recent message all of the sudden.  The code in this PR fixes the issue simply by ignoring the execution that would have loaded data of a range that does not include `aroundIndex`. This works because this situation happens when two or more calls to `onDataNeededAroundIndex` happen very close to each other and one of those would likely have the data at the index we just ignored.  ### Screen record I'll attach screen records in comments below.","closed","","fumiakiy","2021-01-16T16:57:09Z","2021-01-30T12:57:12Z"

Prepare a group chat that does not have its own profile picture 2. Open Signal, go to the chat 3. In the toolbar menu, select ""Add to homescreen"" 4. Confirm that the dialog pops up 5. Cancel the dialog. 6. Open the Android's system ""recent apps"" by tapping on the square button of the Android's system navigation bar 7. In the list of recent apps, select Signal again  **Expected behavior**:  Signal opens the chat and nothing else happens  **Actual behavior**:  Signal opens the chat and the ""Add to homescreen"" dialog pops up again  ### Description of the issue Glide's task automatically resumes upon `onStart` or `onResume` of the activity when the last state was an error. It is an error for Signal to be unable to load a profile picture from a URL so `onLoadFailed` callback is called in the steps above.  Opening the recent apps list puts the activity to paused state and selecting Signal again resumes the activity and it is when Glide kicks in and resumes the task that *failed* the last time.  The solution is to clear Glide's target when either of the callback was called so Glide won't resume requests again on onStart/onResume.  ### Screenrecords |Before|After| |---|---| |https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/105636459-7fc82480-5e36-11eb-98c0-14421e7e1564.mp4|https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/105636468-85256f00-5e36-11eb-97b0-1c175ab54536.mp4|","closed","wontfix,","fumiakiy","2021-01-24T16:24:05Z","2022-01-26T20:54:00Z"

"","11026","call ring goes only to connected headset","# Description  ## Overview  For incoming calls, ringer should sound on mobile-device speakers, even if Bluetooth headset is connected.  The reason is that a user may have recently spoken on a call using a headset, then removed the headset, without ending the connection between the headset and the mobile device. In this case, because the ringer sound currently only occurs through the headset, the user would not have effective audio indication of an incoming call. The native  system for processing regular incoming telephone calls produces sound on both the mobile-device internal speakers as well as any connected headset. As this behavior is generally desirable, Signal application should follow the same pattern.  ## Steps to Reproduce   1. Connect Bluetooth headset. 2. Receive incoming call. 3. *Notice that audio notification occurs through headset but not mobile-device internal speakers. Thus, effective audio indication of incoming call depends on user currently wearing headset.*   # Device   **Device:** LG Nexus 4 **Android version:** 9 (Resurrection Remix  7.0.2) **Signal version:** 5.3.12","open","acknowledged,","brainchild0","2021-02-24T21:35:42Z","2022-05-30T15:47:45Z"

With screen lock inactivity timeout set to its smallest alllowable number, and the user dismissing the Rate me dialog by tapping outside of the dialog, this could mean that the Rate me dialog is displayed  every minute.    The dialog will also show up whenever the user taps on a contact from the home screen, views the conversation screen for that contact, and then returns back to home screen.  This PR fixes the above problem by preventing the Rate Me dialog from being dismissed when tapping outside of the dialog.  By doing so, the user is forced to select one of the Rate me dialog buttons.  This fix was tested by actually attempting to dismiss the Rate me dialog by tapping outside of the dialog.","closed","wontfix,","phileo","2021-02-06T16:16:13Z","2022-02-02T02:05:02Z"

Today, Signal is using non 'public' image URIs for the message notifications and the notifications aren't displaying the message pictures on Android 9 and higher.   This fix ensures that the message notifications are using image URIs from the File Provider with the ""org.thoughtcrime.securesms.part"" authority, so the pictures show up in the notifications as shown in below screenshot.   The fix was tested in AVDs by sending pictures from another device to group and single recipient chats.  ![Screenshot_1617059965](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3311313/112911575-bd119280-90c3-11eb-8e5a-014658597325.png)","closed","","hugokiehl","2021-03-30T00:14:57Z","2021-04-01T19:44:18Z"

This deletion represents ~9% of all strings that have to be translated to new languages. Languages that reached 100% completeness will have a little less to maintain, but that's negligible.  ### Description of change   This commit will remove around 220 English strings that have been identified by Android Studio as unused. It was generated by running the tool (Menu > Refactor > Remove Unused Resources...), then applying the changes only to the English file.  To double check, I have read the key and value of each string quickly. And I have searched for a few of them in the codebase manually. But I am very much new to the codebase so there is a slight risk of error if some code somewhere accesses the strings in a funny way.  I tested this by opening the app and moving around, opening as many activites as I could. This was NOT exhaustive. I did that when the app was in French, and when the app was in English.  Note that Android Studio detects a lot of other unused resource types (ex: tens of icons, one fragment, some IDs in fragments...) but cleaning them might be worthless.  ### Open questions   1. Are there other tests that should be performed for this change? 2. Should I also remove the corresponding strings in other languages? I expect that they will just be marked as deprecated by Transifex, and removed the next time that translations are imported.  ### Screenshot of the tool  ![Android Studio Inspector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/242172/104853977-ad780f80-5904-11eb-9ea0-64855c3edff7.png)","closed","","Caerbannog","2021-01-17T20:12:10Z","2021-01-26T22:20:57Z"

According to https://github.com/git/git/commit/e6c587c733b4634030b353f4024794b08bc86892, the default abbreviation is subject to auto sizing depending on the estimated number of objects in the Git repository. This number can differ if the Signal developers use private branches for developing but then only push the squashed commits to the public repository, or if there are other differences in how the Git repository was cloned or configured. This means the abbreviated Git hash length might not be deterministic.  To solve this, we just use the full Git hash. The GIT_HASH config field is only used in the debug log print out anyway, and using the full hash instead of a hardcoded abbreviated size helps future-proof it as well.  For apkdiff, we ignore the new file names for signing info. We keep the older versions in case they change again (or if someone wants to verify a previous version of Signal that had the old names).  Also, the resources.arsc issue seems to be resolved according to the Google Issue and local testing.  This can't really be tested properly without a new official build with these changes. The Git hash change should not change functionality, because the debug log is the only place it uses the Git hash, and the debug log already supports long lines. However, creating an unsigned APK that is using `commandLine 'git', 'rev-parse', '--short=7', 'HEAD'` results in apkdiff giving `APKs match!`, so the commit hash length does seem to be causing an issue.

At that time, my intention was incorrectly interpreted. Later, there were more reports ([one](https://community.signalusers.org/t/privacy-issue-notifications-for-disappearing-messages-shouldnt-show-content-or-name-regardless-of-the-receivers-notification-settings/1868/8?u=agfngr), [two](https://community.signalusers.org/t/dont-show-disappearing-message-contents-in-the-conversation-list/6238), [three](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5781)) on this issue and finally I was able to convey my true intentions for this feature, simply put by [Meteor0id](https://community.signalusers.org/t/privacy-issue-notifications-for-disappearing-messages-shouldnt-show-content-or-name-regardless-of-the-receivers-notification-settings/1868/15?u=agfngr):  > _It is currently valentines day. Say I send my girlfriend, who is at work, a sexy message. I want to send the message in such a way that she doesn’t accidentally open it while her coworkers are sitting next to her in a meeting. And the notification should not automatically display on her lock screen as soon as the message is received._ > > _A disappearing message should never show content of the message nor the name of the sender on its notification, regardless of the notification setting of the receiver._  I am aware of the fact that disappearing messages are [only intended to keep a tidy history](https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/), but this feature would be so much more powerful and much more in line with a users expectation if the content isn't revealed in the notifications nor the conversation list. Especially these days where there's so much inflow of users coming from other applications. After all these years, I still think it's confusing that you set up a conversation where messages expire after a specific amount of time, which happens at the senders side, but the message is readable for an undefined amount of time in the notifications of the receiver or as a preview in the conversation list...  ### Description  When applied, this pull request will  * make notifications for disappearing messages behave as if the Notification Privacy setting would be set to _No name or message_: incoming messages are seen as ""new message"" and hides both incoming user as well as message content * show ""New disappearing message received"" in the conversation list when the conversation contains one or more unread disappearing messages","closed","wontfix,","auricgoldfinger","2021-01-24T13:53:48Z","2022-03-07T15:17:16Z"

My wife experienced a video call using 750 MB of data even though she was on WiFI. It needs to be controllable in case you are on a metered plan since it might otherwise make the call very expensive. My wife almost uninstalled Signal because of this, but I got her to stay by promising I would fix it.

The profile picture on the ""manage profile"" page is way too small to see well. That, along with the empty space on the page makes it seem odd that it's so small. This pull request simply changes the size to make it easier to see and readjusts the size and position of the camera icon to fit as well.

""Nokia 7.2"" is the correct ro.product.model of this device.  Remark regarding testing: - Comparing this commit to previous additions to the hardware AEC blacklist (e.g. see https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/8678), such a simple addition to the blacklist has at least previously been possible without testing. - Currently, I do not have the possibility to compile/test this commit - would be great if you could consider this anyway. Switching to software AEC should not do any harm in this case.","closed","","marfrh","2021-01-09T20:40:16Z","2021-04-08T18:26:25Z"
