"","3919","Messages sent with limited mobile data enabled won't send on app reopening","Yeah I know, the subject makes no sense. I blame the heat, okay?  Something I noticed today when I was out walking is that if I have TextSecure set to ""Limited mobile data"" so that TextSecure can't use the internet in the background, the messages sometimes won't send when I open the app again. Typically, this is how it happens: 1. I open the app and I write a message to someone. Any messages the person has written of course arrives meanwhile. 2. I ""send"" the message and I back out of the app, but the message isn't sent in time. 3. I open Puffin or whatever, and a minute later I open TextSecure again. The message is still ""sending"". 4. Here's where the problem shows. I sit there, waiting for the message to send. Half a minute passes, yet nothing. 5. I send another message, now both messages send without any problems whatsoever.  What should happen when I open the app is pretty obvious. The message should send, without me having to send another message.  Log while it's ""sending"" to no avail: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2901e20eb9799c2bb182  Now I realize this might be confused with https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/3068 but it's not the same issue. The message never actually fails for me when I do the above. It simply keeps ""sending"" yet nothing happens.","closed","","Dyras","2015-08-09T14:18:45Z","2018-04-02T21:52:22Z"

Debug log (though I doubt you'll want it) is https://gist.github.com/526f0bbf1de80801e008  On WhatsApp, when I attach a contact, it brings up the contact's record with checkboxes next to each item of information that you have for him/her (e.g. numbers and email addresses) and you can choose which you want to include. You then click send and it sends them all together as a record, formatted specially. Clicking on it in the WhatsApp chat then allows you to add that information to your contacts (giving you the option to add it to an existing contact, or create a new contact, as is normal for receiving a contact). It also has a clever little message icon under the contact record that allows you to send a WhatsApp message to that contact straight away without adding them to your address book.  The interface in Signal is much less developed. When you select attaching contact information on the same contact, it only shows me the phone numbers for the contact (rather than the email addresses) and selecting one just inserts the number alone (with no name or formatting). I would like to see Signal send a proper contact record with a similar flow to that described above for WhatsApp, at least if the recipient is also a Signal/TextSecure user and the message is being sent over the data channel.","closed","","Hooloovoo","2015-10-04T21:03:22Z","2015-10-06T15:59:29Z"

"","3355","Attachments - ""Quick Capture"" audio/video recording and playback  (Google's  ""Messenger"" Android app style)?","Those who have used Google's ""Messenger"" application for Android in its more recent iterations may have noticed a new feature for attachments. Clicking the ""paperclip"" for Attachments , besides the usual  options to attach a file, gives the user the option a number of ""Quick, in-app, in-line"" media capture options.   For instance, choosing Picture (or alternately, Video) allows the user to capture the picture or video right from Messenger (a camera window is opened below the text entry box ) which is then added to the message to form the outgoing MMS.  Likewise, if the user chooses the Audio tab  there is a ""Microphone button"" and instructions to ""press and hold to record"". Doing so allows the user to speak a message which is then encoded as an audio file and added to the outgoing MMS.      From what I can tell, TextSecure lacks these options. While a user can send a picture,  video, or audio  file that has already been saved elsewhere, I believe it would benefit TextSecure to enable these ""Quick Capture"" options, both for traditional SMS/MMS and Secure(Data) messaging.  Many users find these options alluring (particularly the audio quick capture, which allows the sending of a short audio message that can be played by the recipient at their leisure) and TextSecure supporting these features would mean users who enjoy them currently on other platforms could switch and enjoy better privacy/security  without having to lose said features  Please let me know if this seems feasible. Thank you.","closed","","RanceJustice","2015-06-06T10:49:30Z","2015-06-06T15:59:55Z"

Since I'm lazy, rather than rebuilding the android application to use the staging server and create another account, I wanted to try to use it to contact my mother and I modified the javascript sources to not use the staging servers (I just removed the `-staging` string from the urls, as a wild guess)  I thought:  > what's the worse that could happen? the messages might just fail to be delivered  well, apparently I was wrong... maybe because the browser plugin expects a newer version of the app, but now I always get the above exception.  The problem still happens even after removing/disabling the extension on my browser. The exception doesn't happen if I put the phone in airplane mode, but otherwise it keeps crashing (and showing the related popup)  I tried to find a way to disassociate my browser from the phone, but apparently there's no such option. Rebooting the phone didn't help.  I frankly could do without TextSecure for a few days... I'd switch back to the normal sms app until this issue would be fixed.  But afaik, the only way I could do that, is by uninstalling textsecure/removing the account. Unfortunately this would then create a new key and I'd need to notify my new contacts of the changed fingerprint.  I'd like if there was a day to do one of the following things: - Tell textsecure to stop connecting altogether - Tell textsecure to disable automatic restart - Export my textsecure's private key (ok, this is less than ideal, but I'm already suffering from a self-inflicted DOS :P )  Also, I understand that an Android application's lifecycle is not as simple as a normal Java app, so it might not be that easy. But is there no way to have a top-level catch-all exception that recognizes such an issue, increments a counter to detect if the failure was a one-off or is cronical, and does something sane (temporarily disabling itself... don't let the exception bubble up to the system, etc.)?

"","3391","quick direct capture","This continues off the work of the original author @turtlekiosk, big shout out. ### what  If a camera is available on the hardware, provide a ""quick capture"" drawer directly within the app. Unlike when using external intents, captured media will never be visible to other apps. Which is pretty cool. ### summary - Use CWAC-Camera library for cross-device camera compatibility since there are many gotchas in the Android world. Unfortunately the library is a bit dated, so there are a few classes that needed to be copied and modified to fit our needs.   - `SurfacePreviewStrategy.java` is copied without modification   - `TexturePreviewStrategy.java` is copied without modification   - `CameraView.java` was copied and modified to initialize asynchronously. Unnecessary parts were removed. - The ""keyboard-aware"" code was moved out of a ViewGroup and into a helper method so it can be used by whatever needs that info. Makes more sense that way. - Drafts can now be encrypted or unencrypted, they're treated the same. All input is through PartAuthority (maybe I should rename it to ContentAuthority come to think of it). A new `CaptureProvider` deals with the file management. ### known bugs - ~~on gingerbread the cropping rectangle isn't set properly, creating a strangely cropped result~~ - dragging animation twitches sometimes, unknown cause","closed","","mcginty","2015-06-11T04:03:27Z","2015-07-01T19:44:02Z"

The concept of a 'emulated SD card' could be even more confusing to those users ('There are no power users').  **Possible terms:** - SD card - storage - device storage - external storage (thx, @2-4601) - anything else?

Tapping the lock would enable QR code verification immediately.  When Axolotl protocol assigns Alice and Bob roles to devices by comparing the base key, they could also be used assign roles for QR-code verification: e.g. display QR code on Alice's device and open camera on Bob's device.   Bob could then scan both fingerprints from Alice's device at the same time: It could both verify that Bob's device had received the proper key from Alice, and that the proper key was delivered to Alice's device. After verification, Bob's device would either report successful verification or MITM risk. Here's a mockup I made:   ![textsecure new fingerprints](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7425650/10236413/ced229e2-68ad-11e5-8b45-eb23871e80a4.jpg)  This approach would reduce the amount of user interaction from nine taps to two, and after crude measuring, verification would be 20 seconds faster.","closed","","maqp","2015-10-01T23:40:32Z","2015-10-27T12:28:29Z"

It was received by the adressee. Hours later, I found the GSM network ""unavailable"" (supposedly due to GSM hiccup, as the phone wasn't moved nor touched). I enabled, then re-disabled flight mode in order to cleanly reconnect to the tower. As soon as this happened, I was briefly notified that TS had troubles sending a message, and TS apparently started to flood the send queue with hundreds of resending attempts. Unfortunately, many (if not all) succeeded, giving the stunned recipient a massive SMS flood / DOS experience. There was a system popup dialog asking if I wanted to allow TS to send the high number of SMS messages it tried to, but the phone (S5, normally very fast and slick ROM) was so busy sending and playing sound alerts that dialog didn't seem to care about my answer (or was immediately replaced by a new instance, I don't know). I shut off the phone and restarted, but as soon as GSM was connected, the mess continued.  Alas, I did not manage to capture any logs. When the phone finally got reponsive again, they appeared empty (I looked with System Tuner Pro).","closed","","GfEW","2015-10-24T12:09:25Z","2015-11-03T18:40:24Z"

"","3928","Warn user about contact leakage before creating a large group","TextSecure makes it too easy to accidentally leak your contacts' phone numbers to each other. It should make it more clear to the user -- perhaps through **a user warning if a group contains more than X people** -- that a group message to a large group will share everyone's phone numbers with everyone else.  Background: I've been an enthusiastic TextSecure user for a couple years now, but I hadn't done much group messaging. I reset my phone and so my TextSecure key had changed. I wanted to let everyone know en masse, and went to create a group of all my TextSecure contacts. Once I created the group (before I explicitly sent a message), it had already created the new group on all of my friends' phones, and I quickly learned that they could all see every other person's phone number.  Obviously, if I'd done much group messaging before on TextSecure, I would have known this. But I hadn't yet, and this was a rough way to learn it that resulted in me weakening the privacy of a good number of my friends.  I can imagine many solutions to address this, but the one that I think would involve the least engineering effort would be to warn a user that phone numbers will be shared before creating a group where the group is above a certain threshold. This could take the form of an OK/Cancel popup after hitting the button to create a group, or something more integrated.  Whatever the solution, I believe adding friction to mass-contact-leakage is well within TextSecure's commitment to a UX that makes secure communication easy. With a high enough threshold, it's unlikely to affect many users, and will only add that friction to a small number of important cases where that friction is constructive.","closed","","konklone","2015-08-12T03:00:38Z","2015-08-12T06:26:21Z"

First, and probably most importantly, is that the person on the other side of this issue is running WhisperPush version 5.0.2-30bd462d41 on a OnePlus running CM (which is the stock OS on the device).  My encrypted push messages to them are good, but I just receive the ""Bad encrypted message"" error.  They can exchange messages with other WhisperPush users, but I'm currently not sure about other TextSecure users.  Normal SMS works, but that's probably not shocking.  Normal MMS also works.  Thoughts/suggestions?","closed","","timewasted","2015-07-14T14:45:05Z","2015-10-21T21:09:03Z"

When I send them a secure message, the message gets stuck in pending status. From that point on, all other secure messages sent to anyone else also get stuck in pending status. The only way I've found to fix things is to uninstall and reinstall the app.  I first noticed this in August 2015, when I sent a message to my contact's old number, for which I later discovered he didn't have access anymore. Reinstalling was the only way to fix things, and I messaged him twice (ie. two reinstalls) before realizing the root of the bug.  I thought it was specific to that old number he'd registered, but now his new number has done the same thing, and it looks like I'll need to reinstall.

Even if it were to be fixed here, why settle on the Apple ones? I can't see how many people have installed Signal but there are 253 ratings, compared to 19,627 ratings for TextSecure. Would iOS users like Android emoji? Probably not. Most people likely prefer whatever they're used to, so it's better to let the system handle the look instead of forcing everyone to use the Apple ones which look really cheap and doesn't fit in at all on Android.  TextSecure uses one set of emoji while the rest of the system and other apps uses another now. Also notifications still use the system emoji and apparently nothing can be done about this. The inconsistencies look really sloppy.   Adding options is usually not a good idea but the same goes for changing the look that people are used to, so if anything there should be a ""compatibility mode"" where those who want to make sure nothing gets lost in translation can switch to Apple emoji.","closed","","ComeGitSome","2015-07-12T20:03:06Z","2015-07-12T21:08:20Z"

"","3359","TextSecure incorrectly thinks recipient is registered","Over the past week I've experienced a very strange failure mode. 1. Me and person P were exhanging unsecured text messages. I was using TextSecure (push registered), while P was using a stock messaging app. 2. At some point, TextSecure on my phone started thinking that P was registered with TextSecure, and switched to sending encrypted messages. I sent a few encrypted messages to P, which P never received. 3. Upon learning that P wasn't receiving my messages, I tried ending the secure session with P on my phone. This had no effect: TextSecure still insisted on sending encrypted messages. I tried de-registering my phone and then registering it again, but that didn't help. Ultimately the only way to reach P was to de-register my phone and keep push disabled :(  The most pressing issue is: Why did TextSecure think P was registered? P never installed TextSecure or Signal, and did not change their phone number, or anything like that.  The secondary issue is: Why did TextSecure not allow me to send plain SMS, even after I selected ""end secure session""?  I looked at the log, and the only potentially relevant line I could find was this:  `W/Directory(22806): Adding active token: +*********xx, 47+CqoNE/Fv5gw`  (where `xx` is the last 2 digits of P's phone number, so I know the line corresponds to their account.)

Hence we can get negative characters remaining as shown below.

Note the Rise is a piece of crap ;) and also one of the last slide-out keyboard phones out there, meaning there might be the mitigating factor of switching from portrait to landscape and the keyboard kicking in.

Of course I would prefer Apple's, but those aren't open source at all so that might be a problem. I don't really see how WhatsApp could get away with using them though. With Signal for Iphone and Signal soon coming to Android, I think it's quite important that both people see the same thing. That's the way Telegram does it, and it makes sure both people see the exact same emojis. Some Apple/Google emojis are so different that it's not even funny. Yeah, I know Samsung for example has their own emojis, but that doesn't exactly make things easier.  Is this being worked on? Is it even being considered?

I live in a remote rural area and cannot get decent phone reception at the same time that I have a wifi connection. If I drive to a spot to receive the SMS then I lose the wifi connection. If I try to do Voice Verify then it says no network - presumably meaning no wifi connection.   So it's impossible to register here. I almost got it once by driving out to get reception but the short time limit of 2 minutes cut off before the SMS that came in moments later.   I don't understand why you have to make it so difficult to register the phone, or even why a secure messaging app needs to have my phone number registered in the first place. Is this some hidden tracking agenda - why need the phone number for text messaging.  But my real point here is to let you know that registration is broken for people like me in rural areas. It seems the only way for me to do this is to wait for some day when I'm at some cafe with free wifi and decent phone reception both together. Can this not be made less onerous?","closed","","neocogent","2015-07-06T02:38:02Z","2015-07-06T02:51:13Z"

"","4048","Message recipients retroactively change after sending","I've only encountered this issue once and have not been able to reproduce it, but it looked really dangerous.  The order of events was, as best I can remember, like this: - I sent a message in an ongoing conversation with Person A. - I started a new conversation and sent one message to Person B. - Person A replied, and when I switched back to the first conversation, the message that I'd sent to Person B appeared to have moved to the conversation with Person A. - When I went back to the screen with the list of recent conversations, the _entire_ conversation with Person B suddenly had Person A's name on it instead.  A moment later, before my eyes, it changed back to Person B's name.  One message that I'd sent to Person A (and which I confirmed that he received) is still shown in my conversation with Person B.  That was a little convoluted, but the end result is that both Person A and Person B have potentially received messages that were intended for the other, and there's no way for me to know who got which messages without checking with both of them.","closed","","cosmc","2015-09-09T01:17:10Z","2018-04-02T21:50:58Z"

Sorry to repeat here, but I don't see any action happening or issues opened about this.  I find that usability of writing in the app is severely hampered by having the writing div be a fixed height child of the reading div.  You can read by scrolling the whole screen, then when you write more than 3 lines, the top lines vanish.  It's fidgety to scroll the parent or the child window separately.  I know you think it's ""handy"" to have the text you're replying to always visible, but IMO it's not.  The text I'm writing is what I need to see the most.  If I'm writing so much that the original message has scrolled off screen, I just need to scroll the whole screen to see it.  I know what I'm replying to. If I'm writing so much, I'll want to re-read before sending, so why do I have to fidget w/ a tiny window.  IMO, the scrolling-window-within-a-scrolling-window UI is not a good thing (imagine side-by-side scrollbars in a browser, ugh).  I know how to scroll my whole screen.  I need to see what I'm about to send without having to fuss.  p.s. thanks for such an amazing product.","closed","ux,","jeanrajotte","2015-10-26T13:25:17Z","2018-04-02T21:58:31Z"

Debug log (though I doubt you'll want it) is https://gist.github.com/526f0bbf1de80801e008  It would be great if geo: uris in messages that I receive turned into hyperlinks that, when clicked, gave the choice of opening the geo: link in whatever applications the user has installed that deal with them.  geo: uris are a way of encoding location information in a universal way, instead of doing so in a mapping-application specific way. See: http://geouri.org/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI_scheme https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#Maps  The geo intent appears to be supported on Android (if I click on a geo link in Chrome, it asks me which of my various mapping applications I would like to open it with), but geo: uris within messages in Signal do not turn into hyperlinks and cannot be clicked to load up the location on a map. I commonly see this with OSMAnd links, which generate a geo: uri by default when one uses it to send a location. I believe that GeoSMS also sends geo: links to other people via SMS.  To a degree this is a privacy issue. A key reason I use OSMAnd is because it does offline mapping and geo: uris allow you to send and resolve locations without sending them to a remote webserver (like Google Maps).   I'm not an Android developer, but it looks to me like the 7-odd lines of example code in the developer.android.com link above should go a long way to making these geo: uris work.","closed","feature,","Hooloovoo","2015-10-04T21:31:53Z","2018-04-02T21:59:18Z"

"","3863","General rules for translations?","I'm on the translate team for TextSecure and SMSSecure for the Dutch language, and I noticed in both projects some inconsistencies. In Dutch, you have 2 forms for the English ""you"" (ignoring the ""thou"" form here): the informal ""jij"", and the more formal ""u"". I noticed both forms are used in translations, probably depending on the personal preference of the translator of the specific string. In French you have ""tu"" and ""vous"", in German ""du"" and ""sie"", but I didn't check the French and German translations to see if the forms are mixed there too. I don't know any other languages well enough to say if it can be an issue there.  In current Dutch both forms are socially acceptable (although some mostly elder people frown on the use of the informal form).  I would suggest the app choose one of the forms to be more consistent. Having both forms mixed makes a sometimes strange impression. I have no strong personal preference for either form.  What is the opinion of the developers?","closed","","johanw666","2015-08-01T09:43:42Z","2015-08-01T16:55:48Z"

A system like currently used when searching for contacts where certain threads stay on top of the entire thread list. 2. An icon that would change the UI to show only favorited threads but when toggled would change back to all threads.  In addition, using the android back button would return to full thread list too. 3. Swiping the thread list (left or right?) would show only favorited threads; swiping back would of course return to normal view. In addition, using the android back button would return to full thread list too.  Perhaps a star icon could be used to indicate ""favorite"" where that's needed.  Also, ""favoriting"" a contact could be done by long-press options and/or when tapping the contact's name at the top of the thread and indicated by one of those lollipop-looking switches like the mute conversation one.","closed","feature,","jeremymasters","2015-07-14T15:42:11Z","2018-04-02T21:48:34Z"

The use case is you have a message but want to choose who to send it to.

Other times you need to put +521 (the additional 1 is used to distinguish between fixed and mobile phones, a purely historical reason). So, when you send or receive messages, sometimes it's just the number, sometimes it's +52, sometimes it's +521. This seems to confuse a lot the TextSecure/RedPhone server, and in many cases two registered (or re-registered users) can't talk to each other unless they first send a secure SMS, do the key exchange over SMS, and then they can use the push method. I know, it sounds weird, but that's Mexico ;) Please have a look at it and see if it's possible to merge the +52 and +521 numbers into a single identity.

I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example:  ""Let's speak privately!

It suggests that they are at the same point in the hierarchy, and the only thing that suggests otherwise is the slight drop-shadow that you can sometimes see over a text bubble if it is in the right place. - In the dark theme, the status bar color is lighter than the action bar, this looks particularly odd (and goes against design recommendations I believe).  This pull request makes two changes: - In the light theme, makes the text bubbles match the color of the status bar. - In the dark theme, swap the status bar and action bar colors.

Unfortunately, the app is requesting a lot of new permissions. The stated reason is so you can integrate RedPhone later on, which makes sense to make TextSecure more like Signal.  While I don't want to imply that I think you guys are doing anything fishy with my data, you will surely understand that people might not install a secure messaging app that has just about access to anything.   For example, I cannot see how access to my Calendar is important to exchange messages nor to make phone calls.   I think it would really serve you and the community well if you would put an explanation of all the permissions in a prominent place on the open whisper systems website. Having this information easily accessible (link from Google store to that site?) will help users to build trust.   Of course anyone can read the code to see that you are not up to anything, but that isn't a good enough answer here since not many people will have the time nor the technical expertise to do so.   If your code is audited you could add information about audits on your website, stating who did the audit, with which version of the app and link to their results.

So far that is fine.  But:  The lock symbol and the date in those incoming message bubbles basically have the same color as the bubble's background, which results in a very low contrast and bad readability.  In comparison:  The outgoing message bubbles in TextSecure 2.21.0 have a white background and the text inside those outgoing message bubbles is black/dark gray.

Without them, SQLite has been having to sort with temporary B-Trees which is not so efficient. Part of this requires using (column AS name) instead of (expr AS name), so I had to migrate the MMS database to use normal timestamps. - Use the SQLite EXISTS method for checking if a conversation is empty instead of having to do a full sweep of the table. - Move unnecessary HashMap and array allocations to static variables for the most-used getConversation() method. - Stop keeping track of message count in ThreadDatabase since we don't use it and it's slow.","closed","","mcginty","2015-08-04T01:04:07Z","2015-08-04T18:39:19Z"

It has the same quick capture layout, a gallery, (stickers), audio messages (push-to-talk style) and send location.   Maybe some dev could take a look at it and tell us if this would be possible. I (personally) think the design is just great :smile:   ![screenshot_2015-08-19-12-53-44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3447340/9354663/b718e62c-4672-11e5-9399-00b9b9ffe387.png)","closed","","Mihahn","2015-08-19T11:08:06Z","2015-08-19T17:07:54Z"

Some users will click through that without thinking. And someone who's never chatted to me before will not get any warning because of TOFU.  Since I don't think there's any intention to aggressively push users to manually verify key fingerprints, it would be nice if I could add a passphrase to my registration that would not let someone register a new device with my phone number without also having that passphrase. Since this adds some friction, it would be reasonable for it to be opt-in; that is to say, once I register my number for the first time, I should be able to go into the settings and enable the passphrase requirement.  The biggest drawback I can see is that if I give up my phone number and then it is reassigned, someone else will be stuck unable to use textsecure with that number. I can't really think of a perfect way to solve this, but expiring a registration that hasn't been used at all in some period of time, say 12 months, would probably be a reasonable approach. Alternatively, instead of just requiring use, the server could periodically send the client a liveness check of some sort (via push), and clear the registration if those don't succeed for some shorter period of time (3 months?) if the app isn't even responding at all.","closed","","laurencebgood","2015-08-27T04:43:35Z","2015-09-30T20:23:33Z"

"","4100","Problems with properly accessing contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices?","Could it be that TextSecure has problems with contacts stored via CardDAV on older Android devices?  Since a couple of weeks (then on 2.25.3, now 2.26.5) I'm experiencing some problems. I have all my contacts stored via CalDAV, none on the SIM card and none on the phone (that runs on 4.2.2).  1) Since a couple of weeks almost all TS-using contacts are shown twice in the list of TS users (and once under ""All contacts""). Only newly added TS contacts are listed once. It started when I used TS 2.25.3.  2) Today I noticed that one contact was listed (in the conversations list and in TS' contacts list) without her name, only by her number. Although the native contacts app shows a perfectly fine entry, when I tried to call that person, her name was not shown when dialing (as it would normally happen); instead her number was listed as an ""other"" number---in the native contacts app, her number is labeled ""mobile"". In fact, when I tried to edit the contact in the native contacts app, at the bottom there is an entry for TextSecure (that cannot be edited) that indicates that the number is stored on the phone with the label ""other"". (In turn, when I restrict the contacts to app to show contacts stored on the phone only, it lists none, as I would expect.)  Does that imply that TS creates a local copy of the CardDAV phone number on the phone? In fact, said contact is one the many duplicates.  3) I played around and ""separated"" and re-""joined"" the varying accounts via which I'm connected to said person in the native contacts app. Now her name (instead of her number only) is listed twice again in the list of TS users, but the two entries are not listed in two subsequent rows, but the first entry jumped to the very top of the list, before the names starting with an A.

"","3809","TextSecure changes colors of Google contacts","Contacts without assigned images in the default Google contacts app (also used in the default phone dialer) are assigned a color which normally cannot be changed. Recently however, I've noticed that contacts of the people who are TextSecure registered users _do change_. The color changes are seemingly random (one was grey, then light blue, red, orange, now purple), and I have yet to find a pattern as when they happen (once it occurred right after I switched back to the contact screen from TextSecure; sometimes I only notice when I open the phone dialer). When it happens all of the contacts of TextSecure users change at once.  I'm not exactly sure what causes the problem, but I'm pretty sure it is an issue with TextSecure since all my contacts' colors stay the same _except_ for those who also use TextSecure (even one whom I've never actually texted).   Note that this does not apply to the colors that you can assign people within TextSecure; those remain the same. Changing them within TextSecure is probably not the impetus for a change in contacts either, since one that I've never changed within TextSecure has changed in Google contacts.  I wonder if it has something to do with the new searching contacts screen in TextSecure? I feel it happens more often after I go to that screen, but that's just a guess.  I'm using TextSecure 2.23.2 on a Nexus 5 running Android 5.1.1.

I texted contact #2 who's SMS phone formatted XXX-XXX-XXXX and the message sent. I changed contact #1 to the same format as contact #2 and the message was sent/received.   Not a big problem but wanted to raise awareness that maybe a little regex could be applied to the SMS send function.  Android v2.21.0  Edit...

"","4073","make the migration and media situation suck a bit less","As it turns out, outgoing group media was never marked as non-pending after it was sent, which was the assumption that caused the most recent thumbnail click regression.  After thinking about it, I decided parts should only have a data uri set if there's a corresponding data file to read from, and that should be the authoritative indicator on if we can preview the media. So that's what this change does.  As for the migration: we will not try to download any part that already has a non-null data column (has media available already). I wasn't able to reproduce @McLoo's failure case and there haven't been any other crash reports besides that one, but this seems like a more fail-safe way to do this check than looking for a content location.  Tested the migration with pending parts that actually need downloading, along with outgoing group media and the previously borked self-send media messages.  Assuming 2.26.5 will be version code 151","closed","","mcginty","2015-09-14T21:57:54Z","2015-09-15T01:06:36Z"

"","3684","Improve generated contact photos with emoji names","_This is a re-submission of pull #3617 as this code should be more readable._  --- ### Issue  This commit fixes Issue #3604.  Contact names which begin with emoji characters cause their generated photo to consist of the ""question-mark-in-a-box"" UTF-8 character.  This commit fixes the issue by using a new function to strip out any non-language (not just English) characters from their contact name, and instead use the first character of the returned string as their contact photo initial.  --- #### Basic Documentation ##### `String getCharacter(String name)`  `(String) name` is the name of the contact that requires their photo to be generated.  This function will return the first character of their name that should be suitable for use in the generated contact photo. Any whitespace, emojis, or non-language characters should be removed from their name and leave only characters suitable for display in their contact photo.","closed","","danbartram","2015-07-17T16:46:57Z","2015-11-24T00:27:44Z"

With the proposed change (basically the same as [SmsDatabase.java#L434](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/f1e8357131a91c9000bebcd0b8858a2be7c4adb5/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/SmsDatabase.java#L434), just without the call to PhoneNumberUtils.formatNumber()), `record.recipients` contains a recipient with `name = ""Some Group Name""` and `number = ""__textsecure_group__!some_group_id""`. The resend button now only resends to the selected recipient.  I'm not sure if there's some existing code relying on the current behaviour. At least I found no problems when testing sending, re-sending and receiving one-to-one and group messages with and without media.","closed","wontfix,","haffenloher","2015-06-09T21:50:59Z","2022-02-02T08:58:48Z"

This guaranteed    serialization of messages per-recipient, while allowing    processing of multiple recipients in parallel.  Unfortunately    in the case of groups, this results in out of order    conversations, since the ""sender"" for each message is    different.  And we can't determine that it was a group    message until _after_ we process it.  So this change just    puts all message processing from all senders in one big queue.  2) Synchronization messages were always being displayed before    received messages, due to the ""received time"" for those    being set to the time they were sent.

It seems like a new secure session has been silently started afterwards, and the user is not informed about this fact.  As far as I understand it, the wording of '**Reset secure session**' is the one which is correct, i. e. the existing session gets closed and a new session with a new session key is created immediately afterwards.

Most people probably don't want to search for their contacts at the first, but immediately click on them in  their contact list, as stated in the corresponding issue. Fixes #3704 - ContactSelection: Pressing the toggle button now brings up the keyboard.  Furthermore I changed the keyboard as the default for the toggle button instead of the dial pad, because people would like to input real names instead of phone numbers most of the times and since the keyboard ist hidden by default the keyboard should appear first when clicking the toggle button.

"","4009","SMS fallback not triggered if recipient offline","#### Use case:  I and my contact are ""push registered"", but at various times one of us goes offline for a few hours and would like to seamlessly switch to SMS.  Explanation: I only use data when connected to WiFi, so SMS is prefered communication channel much of the time.  This is common amongst my contacts here in Europe, but some have mobile data. #### Issue:  TS seems to switch to PUSH whenever sender has data (or even if previous conversation was PUSH). This leads to frustrating undelivered messages if sender simply hits reply without deliberately forcing SMS. #### Feature request:  When there is evidence that the sender **or** recipient is offline, there should be some way to prefer SMS.    Two possible ways to avoid these undelivered PUSH replies: 1. Seamless SMS fallback if **either** person is not online. 2. If ""seamless"" is not an option: receiving an SMS should trigger SMS mode for the conversation.  I understand that defaulting to SMS is problematic now that SMS encryption is gone, but this could be an ""Advanced"" option for nerds like me.  Can add a warning as modal, or in settings: _""Warning: this could cost you money or accidentally lead to insecure SMS communication.""_ #### Related:  This behavior was outlined by @cramu here:  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/pull/984#issuecomment-36750018  > If sender or recipient are not reachable (because mobile data is not available) a popup appears, warning the sender that the message could be delayed and asking him for confirmation or to edit his message and send via SMS/MMS.
