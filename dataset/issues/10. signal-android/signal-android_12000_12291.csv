But later, there only is the option of importing/exporting a TextSecure SMS database, and nothing to re-import the standard SMS database (useful when the user did something wrong and wants to start over)  It's kind of an issue: you can still clear all TextSecure data from Android and start over, but it also resets your keys…  So, it would be cool to be able to trash all existing TextSecure SMS and re-import the standard SMS database, all in one go and without resetting the keys.","closed","feature,","zorun","2012-01-22T15:08:01Z","2013-11-09T02:57:24Z"

However, this process can take quite a long time (tried with 3000+ SMS). The screen has the time to turns off, and when you turn it on again, TextSecure asks again if you want to import the standard SMS database. If you say ""Yes"" again, a lot of messages are duplicated…  The easiest fix would be to inhibate the screen saver, but it wouldn't handle more complex cases (such as the user launching another program while TextSecure is processing the SMS)","closed","","zorun","2012-01-22T15:32:32Z","2013-11-09T02:57:24Z"

You have forbidden to distribute TextSecure binaries outside the Google Play Store.  All the arguments have you mentioned to justify this (https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/127) are invalid, because this restriction contradicts to the _Freedom 2_ of the Free Software definition: the freedom to redistribute copies of the software without asking permission. Also the GPL grants this. You can do some research if you don’t believe me.  As a result, you have two options to solve this issue: - Release TextSecure under a non-free proprietary license with all restrictions you want. Then you should delete this GitHub repository or make it private.   or - Drop your restrictions that violate GPL and let TextSecure be a **REAL** free software.  You have the choice.

I've removed all unnecessary R. inclusion, combined strings that should be together, and removed all the Log.w/d modification (to be added again in a later commit!).  There are still some new line breaks in the strings.xml file, which can cause problem with Arabic, Farsi and some other non-Roman character sets, however, I think we can deal with those tweaks once we get those translations underway. This first step should allow us to get all EU, as well as Chinese, Korean, Tibetan, Hindi, etc.","closed","","n8fr8","2011-12-29T19:45:24Z","2014-09-13T13:23:28Z"

In particular, this morning, I went to use Google Hangouts and received a prompt from the app to verify my phone number. I clicked the option to verify and received an SMS from Google stating ""Your Google verification code is _NCCiEA5qvy"". I assume this is supposed to be some sort of hyperlinked URL that I am supposed to click on, yet TextSecure is only showing it to me as text so I am unable to click on it in order to verify my number with Google.","closed","","tin-can-zz","2013-06-26T18:59:45Z","2013-06-26T21:08:38Z"

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail).  I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

"","61","Opens to most recent conversation, can't get back to conversation list.","This has been happening randomly for me lately, I assume it's since the latest update. My passphrase is cached, and when I go to open TextSecure, it opens to the most recent conversation. Hitting the back key seems to just close and re-open the same conversation. The only way I seem to be able to open the conversation list is by killing the two TextSecure processes from the running apps list. Then when I restart, if I enter into a different conversation from the list, exiting that conversation by pressing the back key, brings me back to the most recent conversation again, not the conversation list.  I think it might be worth noting also that deleting the conversation thread that persistently shows (most recent...usually...I think), doesn't solve the issue, a blank/new thread with the same contact is shown in place of the deleted one.  If it helps, I've got a Sony Xperia S LT26i running Android 4.0.4  If there's any other information I can provide, just let me know here.

Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"".  This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past.  Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.  Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.","closed","feature,","bottiger","2013-06-28T12:51:05Z","2015-07-30T15:53:37Z"

I don't need most of them for every day usage, i don't even need them on my device, but some of them are important to me and want to be able to read them when needed. I have an app on my device that backs them up from default SMS client to xml database and automagicaly transfers it to my dropbox so I can read old SMSes on my computer whenever I want. The only problem in this scenario is that I don't like my personal stuff laying around unencrypted on clouds that belong to some corporation (I can encrypt personal or confidential emails on gmail with PGP if I want).  So, could anything similar to above solution be done with TextSecure database, only in an encrypted form (maybe PGP encrypted) in a way as simple as possible?

"","199","Feature Request: Force Encrypted Sessions","I would like to make it clear to anyone who texts me that I use TextSecure only. I think two modes could be added: - Paranoid - gives you the prompt to add an exception for the contact or fire a canned response - Restricted - fires a canned response, optionally notifies the user  Here's the idea:  ``` If (incoming session == unsecure && no exception rule exists for this contact)     If (message != key exchange request)         If (mode == paranoid)             Prompt user choice:                  1. add an exception                 2. Send a canned response ""I only speak privately! Please download TextSecure to talk to me!""         If (mode == restricted)             Send canned response.             Notify user if they've opted in to receive refusal notifications. ```  So you set it to paranoid for the first few days to establish who'll do encrypted and who won't or can't. Once you're adequately happy with who can text you, stop everyone else from doing so. For the record, even in the block mode you should get to see who tried to text you in the list. The paranoid mode is a total convenience, but I think if I proposed just the block mode only -- it would seem too harsh!  This is my first issue I've ever opened, let me know if it needs changing/moving or something.","closed","feature,","Bujiraso","2013-06-13T16:30:20Z","2015-03-21T11:41:07Z"

It is sad to see that FDroid and WhisperSystems could not work together, I truly enjoy both projects. Needless to say a google alternative is required - google more and more frequently involves itself in privacy violations. I am opening this ticket in hopes that an alternative of some sort is made.  Possibilities: 1) WhisperSystems creates it's own official FDroid repository, as did GuardianProject: https://guardianproject.info/2012/03/15/our-new-f-droid-app-repository/  2) WhisperSystems provides an APK somewhere out there for people to download with simple instructions on how to verify it's not been tampered with.  In the event this is not done users not wanting Google will have to compile it from source, which although can be done, is a major inconvenience especially to newbies. Just for reference, there seems to be a large interest in migrating away from google. e,g, the NoGAPPS project: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?s=a7bf27eb98e3bcefb7e58fb46d09710b&t=1715375   I hope you all come up with a resolution.

At the moment my impression that it's not but just assumes there are no MITM and stores the keys for verification at a later point.  I guess this a very convenient and reasonable default. However, it would be nice if I could ""strongly authenticate"" my contacts which would indicate I have verified the keys in person and trust them. This could (should IMO) also be rewarded by adding some visual indicator in the UI.

I've put together a patch that provides the information by default for some common US carriers. Currently contains info for T-Mobile USA, AT&T, and Verizon. Tested and works on T-Mobile. Obviously there are hundreds of carriers worldwide that would need to be added for a full solution, but this should help some users and can be expanded on incrementally.

Before, hitting the back button while in a conversation thread would always return me back to the message list view. Now, hitting back will often send me to other conversation threads, often times it will send me to the SAME conversation thread I just hit back on.  I believe this happens when I view messages via the status bar notification. Example:  I am talking to somebody in a conversation thread then hit home. The same person messages me again, and I select the message from the status bar to view it. Then I hit back - it will take me to the exact same conversation I was just on. Then I have to hit back again to get to the message list view.  When talking to many people at once this gets quite annoying.  The back button on a conversation should always return to the message list!  Thank you guys for the fantastic software.","closed","","firepacket","2013-03-14T03:19:12Z","2014-12-29T20:50:34Z"

"","143","Send a ""aborting session"" notification accross the channel, close the session upon receiving it.","After having experienced the issue quite often, I've been looking at the code just now to make sure the behaviour hadn't changed since I had the issue. If I'm missing something, just close this :)  So, if I'm not mistaken, when aborting a secure session, this happens :  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/crypto/KeyUtil.java#L79   Basically, keys are flushed, status is retored, and the thread goes on.  So if Alice and Bob were having a secure exchange, and Alice aborts the secure session, she never notifies Bob of this.  The result is that Bob still has the symmetric encrypton key in his memory, and more importantly, he will use them to communicate with Alice on the next message, even a month after Alice flushed the keys...  This forces most users to keep the secure sessions ON all the time. Which means keys are not flushed ASAP as they probably should be. I think Textsecure should allow for an usable application of the best practice of ending secure sessions when an exchange has been completed.  This could be fixed very easily by sending a ""I'm aborting the session"" notification accross the secure channel before clearing everything. This should probably not require an ACK of any sort, so it would be quite cheap, and then it's up to the other person to close its side of the session too (but Textsecure should recognize that the other side of the covnersation has already ended its secure session, so no notification should be sent when Bob closes its session too.)  You could even automatically close the session upon receiving this notification.  I'm tempted to say that we could also use this additionnal step to disclose authentication keys and get plausible deniability, but I'm not sure if it's possible to do this without screwing up the secure channel big time, so it's probably better to not do that ATM :)  I know SMSes are not cheap for everyone, but making the other party of the conversation doesn't stay unsynced with the conversation state would probably be a great improvement... I'm tired of receiving messages encrypted with month-long-gone encryption keys, because they never see that I closed the session.","closed","feature,","koolfy","2013-03-10T00:12:17Z","2014-03-12T16:09:28Z"
