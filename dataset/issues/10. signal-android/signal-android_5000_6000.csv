Upon investigation I found that the app was setting the ""default"" uri to null which caused issues because the default uri on devices isn't null and is valid while none corresponds to a null uri. This makes sense too because the default sound plays noise therefore must have a uri that references the sound file on the device while the none setting doesn't play any noise and so can have a null uri.","closed","","mmeister1203","2017-10-30T16:57:39Z","2017-12-01T20:58:28Z"

If your phone can create and display the dialog quickly enough for it to needlessly turn the speakerphone off before IncomingRinger turns the speakerphone on, you get a ringtone. If it takes your phone too long to wake up, create the lockscreen, and then bring up the dialog, then no ringtone (or a very brief ringtone) for you.  This patch removes the ""unchecking"" of the control buttons for speakerphone, bluetooth, videomute, and audiomute when there's an incoming call. They're still disabled, but they're left in the default states so no extra events get thrown to the listeners.

"","6577","A better dark theme","Yes, I want to commit this the official way, but I'm missing directions for this. I'd like to submit a -in my view- much better dark color theme, but it's not clear where it needs to go in the Signal code-tree. For now I would rather just submit the range of colors for it, so someone with clear access can add it as an extra optional theme.  - We all have 24 bit color screens on our Android systems. The current Signal themes, aside from them not offering a lot of visual appeal, are not even all that legible: White on light red, white text on tan brown, really? I can't imagine Moxie would have signed for that to be the main dark theme, or did he?  - Here's a theme I once created for Squirrelmail, which I still use a lot because of its simplicity, and because this theme is so easy on the eyes, with good contrast and reminiscing of being in nature, think dark forest, fireflies, [Twin Peaks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFCmrB4hr_mBMwzg3vGrsQ/videos). I would imagine the several mildly differing dark greens could function as the backgrounds for the message bubbles, and the yellow-green-ish color[8] should be perfect for the text on them. Lots better than what it is now. In fact, some in my surroundings have simply stopped using Signal because of its dark theme, while the same people are still using this dark theme on my webmail-servers; ``` $color[0]   = '#092003'; // TitleBar $color[1]   = '#DDFEAB'; // Quote in mail $color[2]   = '#FECF10'; // Warning/Error Messages $color[3]   = '#041001'; // Left Bar Background $color[4]   = '#030900'; // Normal Background $color[5]   = '#102903'; // Table Headers $color[6]   = '#C3CEAC'; // Text on left bar (user created folders/Purge etc.) $color[7]   = '#CEEFAC'; // Links (also email-addresses) $color[8]   = '#EFFEDE'; // Normal text $color[9]   = '#091902'; // Darker version of #0 $color[10]  = '#081800'; // Darker version of #9 $color[11]  = '#CCDDC0'; // Special Folders color $color[12]  = '#182907'; // Alternate color for message list $color[13]  = '#DEFDAF'; // Color for quoted text -- > 1 quote $color[14]  = '#BDEFA1'; // Color for quoted text -- >> 2 or more $color[15]  = '#163011'; // Unselectable folders $color[16]  = '#F0CD09'; // Highlight color ```  - Please be somewhat respectful of the chosen colors here, be aware that these selections and combinations are not slammed together in a couple of hours; It evolved into these exact color picks during the last 17(!) years of use on some webmail servers I still maintain, and it versioned into this from friends' and relatives' user input and my own taste and views etc.  - I know you're going to kill this as a non-Issue, for not following guidelines, but it *is* an issue. I don't want to work on signal code, I just want to add a GUI color theme. Here's me hoping someone will pick it up as such.","closed","","jult","2017-04-25T09:04:39Z","2018-04-03T02:31:39Z"

I suggest we have parity on Android.  * https://github.com/WhisperSystems/SignalServiceKit/pull/130 * https://github.com/WhisperSystems/SignalServiceKit/pull/139  Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.","closed","feature,","charlesmchen","2017-03-21T21:10:48Z","2018-04-03T02:05:15Z"

"","7277","FR: Integrated keyboard input (Google Keyboard spying?)","This may sound (and even be) overly paranoid, but the most advanced encryption in the world is meaningless if using an input method like Google Keyboard, with system-wide microphone access and other permissions.  Tonight I had Signal open while watching a discussion on vegetarianism and magically I had a msg populated with ""I would die I was sick of being hungry I was sick of beans and rice"".  I DID NOT write this, or ever discuss this topic with the contact.  Perhaps it's just a random coincidence, but it sounds quite a bit like the endless reports alleging Facebook listening in and serving ads based on ambient audio. Regardless if it's a real security concern, it could be a potential one,.  A few ideas: 1) Have the option for Signal to use it's own built in keyboard, similar to those meant to circumvent keyloggers.  2) There are apps like Microphone Block and Camera Block for Android which disable the microphone and camera on a system wide basis.  Replicating this functionality in Signal for a ""Get Smart: Super Paranoia Cone of Silence Mode"" would be a great addition for those that trust Signal/OWS, but maybe not Google Keyboard/Android.  This still obviously isn't a 100% guarantee, but could help shift the balance  from ubiquitous surveillance to highly targeted surveillance (where it should be, and all we can realistically hope for)...","closed","","ThoughtPhotography","2017-12-14T08:50:37Z","2017-12-14T19:03:45Z"

If your phone can create and display the dialog quickly enough for it to needlessly turn the speakerphone off before IncomingRinger turns the speakerphone on, you get a ringtone.  If it takes your phone too long to wake up, create the lockscreen, and then bring up the dialog, then no ringtone (or a very brief ringtone) for you.

"","7169","Feature discussion: Blockchain verified conversations","This discussion really applies to the entire Signal stack, but it had to put someplace. Also, I'm not entirely sure signal doesn't already have something like this.  Signal does a great job at client e2e encryption. People mostly seem excited about it's ability to prevent people from listening in on conversations. Aside from encryption GPG also gives us verification that the message originated from a specific individual. I'm curious, what is that verification was taken one step further?  What if a blockchain (of sorts) was kept for each conversation? This way, we enforce the order in which messages were sent and most importantly that message b came directly after message a. Deletion or insertion of messages after the fact would not be possible. Such an implementation would ensure a conversation remains the same between all parties involved and that no individual could inject or remove parts of conversations without the other parties involved noticing.  An example of something like this is how git handles commits. Each commit contains a hash of the current commit (and diff) and the hash of the previous commit. A simple program can then run against the commits to verify the repo is in good order.  In Signal's case, a central authority would be necessary. So the hash chain would probably need to exist on the server. The clients can sync against the hash chain and verify their local conversations match the server's.   Thoughts?","closed","","vangorra","2017-11-09T15:45:40Z","2017-11-09T17:47:47Z"

Some devices do not have a sim card slot but the users owns another phone that can receive messages. Other users want to register with a phone number bought from a service like Twilio. In these cases it is difficult to register with the current procedure.  I propose this kind of solution: - After the 2 minutes SMS timeout, a screen is shown to the user, asking to manually enter the code receives via SMS. The screen also have a clear button that says ""I didn't receive any sms"", or something like that. - If the user taps on ""I didn't receive the SMS"", the current voice verification screen is shown.  The vast majority of the users will never see this screen.

This applies both to the message forwarded to Bob's client, and the message synced to Alice's Desktop client under Bob's thread, both will get `""audio/*""` content types.

"","7151","Receiving messages not meant for me while updating desktop version","Sorry for not sticking to the proper bug report format, I'm a little scared and confused and wanted to get out a report as soon as possible. tl;dr: my desktop version of signal is not showing my conversations but those of a friend.   The details: I had Signal installed on my laptop (Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS) as a chromium app and on my phone, everything working fine. I wanted to install the new standalone Signal on my laptop. Here are steps I did as well as I remember. Sorry, I don't know how to try to reproduce this, so there may also be irrelevant steps listed.  1. I followed the Linux install instructions: 	$ curl -s https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add - 	$ echo ""deb [arch=amd64] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main"" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list 	$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install signal-desktop  2. I tried to follow https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/115002502511-How-do-I-migrate-messages-to-the-new-Signal-Desktop-  3. I opened the old chromium signal app, there was a message saying it needed to be updated. Clicking on that message opened https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk I was confused that there was no ""update"" button or similar. I tried several times, closing and opening both the chromium browser and the app, until at some point the ""you need to update"" message was gone and it apparently also was the current version: it included the "" Migrate to standalone"" menu item.   4. In this updated chromium app there were weird messages, which I then thought to just be old messages, but have now found out to be not messages between me (J) and my friends but between A and A's friends. So on the right hand side of each conversation there are messages which A has written, and on the left the messages of her friends. There is also a chat with my name, which contains the messages between us, hers on the right, mine on the left. The names of the contacts and contact photos are also A's. These are messages between March 2017 and June 2017 and also some few messages from the day before yesterday (2017-10-30)  5.  I clicked ""Migrate to standalone"", and imported the generated folder in the new signal app.  6. From the new desktop app I wrote ""test"" to a common friend (K). On his phone he received that message twice: at 11:55 in the chat with me, and at 12:03 in the chat with A.   7. Since K's reply only reached my phone but not my the desktop app, I wanted to reconnect the desktop app to the phone. To this end I deleted my laptop under ""linked devices"" in the menu of the signal app on the phone. Shortly after this I did receive Ks reply at my laptop.  8. I found out that the messages were not old messages of mine, but As messages (see description in step 4)   9. Shock, horror and confusion   Only possible hint for an explanation I have that in 2015 or so A gave me an old phone of hers (not the one I'm using right now!) and on that phone first she and later I both used signal. I don't know exactly what degree of ""wiping the phone"" we did in context of the transfer.  My phone: Device  : OnePlus A0001 (bacon) Android : 6.0.1 (2b5f277d1c, MHC19Q) Memory  : 73M (4.69% free, 512M max) Memclass: 192 OS Host : cyanogen App     : Signal 4.11.5  I can also add log files later if that makes sense, but before posting those, I would want to at least roughly read them, for which I am too tired right now.

About 20 minutes ago I tried messaging that same contact after leaving my office, Single immediately went into a crash loop and threw the screen allowing me to report feedback (I've reported it a few times with some descriptive text). The crash still happened after I deleted the cache to Signal.  I set the device to airplane mode and reopened Signal. I was able to open the app without a crash. Opening up the conversation with said friend I could see the message I had sent was still in a pending state (3 dots animating). I long held on the message, deleted it, killed the app (app switcher swipe), turned off airplane mode, reopened the app. No crash.  Again I attempted to message my friend, again hit a boot crash. Repeated my airplane mode steps, then went back to Signal while online and tried to send a message to a different contact. That worked fine, no crash, double check marks.  I left it alone. After about 30 minutes said contact tried messaging me again and the app in the background threw the Android crash submit feedback popup box. The airplane mode trick no longer works, nor does clearing cache. Also my session through the Chrome extension is running fine. I can see the last message I received from the friend was ""Yeah, k"" before any further messages from me or him would cause the app to give up on life.

I feel like a slave to the phone because it grabs my attention constantly when I'm in the middle of something else. It breaks my concentration.  At the same time, I do want to receive notifications. Just not so many.  I propose:  1. Notify the user at most once every X minutes (default: 15 minutes?) after the last notification or after the last time the user opened Signal. There is no point in telling the user many times that messages are available. 2. Notify about an incoming message not immediately but after 1 minute delay. That way multiple incoming messages can be read in one go instead of being constantly forced to either monitor the chat or be distracted by the notifications. I think this feature must be default off because it adds a delay that users might not expect. I'm not sure.  The delay constants should be configurable to adapt the app to users diverse needs. I hope this feature request makes sense for the product. I'm using Google Android 7.1 and Windows 7 with Signal Desktop.","closed","","GSPP","2017-06-23T10:53:40Z","2018-04-03T02:54:57Z"

"","7058","User Experience Suggestions","I love this app but after sharing this with friends and family I see a few things that made their transition a little difficult or just revert back to whatever messaging app they used previously.  Here's a few things I've noticed: - The initial period of finding another contact and sending them an encrypted message isn't very obvious. There's nothing saying the app is syncing with the server to find other contacts that also have Signal so users are left confused trying to send each other an encrypted message but the box still says ""Unencrypted SMS"". An optional tour may be best here to walk new users through Signal.  - On first use, users are left with a big box at the top that asks them to make Signal their default messaging app. It seems to confuse everyone. I suggest that this option should come up after users have had a chance to use the app for a few days rather than prematurely asking them to switch immediately when new users are still exploring it.  - New users tend to switch back to the default messaging app since all the conversations are already on the default messaging app (i.e. the built-in SMS app) so asking the users to import their existing messages into Signal on first run would be more appropriate. I know this conflicts with the above point but these two points are up for discussion.  I will add more observations here as I continue to listen for difficulties with Signal from others.","closed","","JustPassingByHere","2017-10-06T14:47:36Z","2018-04-03T04:37:26Z"

When they send me full resolution (13 MP) pictures made with their smartphones, I receive scaled down pictures (approximately 3 MP). Other contacts (using iPhones with 12MP-Cameras) can send pictures that I receive just as they were shot in terms of resolution. All pictures were sent via data (not MMS). Let me know if there's additional information that I forgot to include. Thanks!   ### Steps to reproduce - find contacts using a Nokia 5 - Make them send you a 13MP-picture made with their smartphone (i.e. their camera app) - Make them capture and send the debug log - receive picture and save to device - check the details of the received picture.  **Actual result:** The received picture has a resolution of approximately 3 MP **Expected result:** The received picture shouldn't have been scaled down that much.

The term push-to-talk appears in #3563 but that issue seems to be about sending voice messages, and the way this feature is currently implemented is not the way the term PTT is commonly used. For PTT, voice should be streamed in real time.  PTT conversations could be left open for days or months, and at any given time no data is necessarily being transferred unless someone has their thumb on the PTT button.  ### Why  PTT is a love-it or hate-it kind of feature. For me, it would be a major selling point that I could use to get a few more people onto Signal. For couples, families, hands-free driving, and teams who might otherwise use walkie talkies, this method of communication can be a far superior experience than extensive SMS, group calls, or frequent short phone calls.  ### How  Having the phone suddenly blurt out a friend's voice is the main anti-feature. For this reason people need to be able to manage the state of being in a PTT conversation or not. Here's a draft sketch for how I imagine this working:  In order to be able to be heard live, the caller needs to first initiate a conversation through the menu in the SMS thread. When off, the interface would look and work exactly as it does currently, except for the new menu option to start a PTT conversation. The callee would accept the conversation either through a notification or an indicator in the SMS thread.  When a PTT conversation is active, the microphone icon would change to indicate that holding it will stream audio live, and a menu item for muting the conversation would be enabled. The three PTT conversation states would be **active**, **muted**, and **off**, with the only shared state being whether the conversation is active or not. When the user mutes a conversation, no indication is sent to the other party.  So long as the conversation is active, all incoming audio would be saved as audio messages the same way they currently appear in the SMS thread. When muted, the audio would not play until the user specifically listens to it. When unmuted, it would play live through the speaker phone. Details:  events ⇩ | states ⇨| - | - | -|-|-|- _ | PTT Active | PTT Off | PTT Muted press and talk | stream audio to everyone in conversation | record audio and send as a file when finger lifted | same as PTT Off receive stream | play audio live and also save as message | save audio as unread message, as if it was not streamed | same as PTT Off receive audio message | same as PTT Off | same as existing behavior | same as PTT Off user begins PTT | N/A | send PTT invitation, change state to PTT Active | N/A user receives PTT invitation | ignore event | notification of PTT invitation | same as PTT Active user accepts PTT invitation | N/A | state changes to PTT Active | N/A user declines PTT invitation | N/A | send PTT hang-up to all members | N/A user ends PTT | send PTT hang-up, state changes to PTT Off | N/A | same as PTT Active PTT hang-up received | change state to PTT Off | drop pending invitation | same as PTT Active PTT muted | change state to PTT Muted | N/A | N/A  There are multiple ways that the shared state of being in a PTT conversion can get out of sync, but with the event handling described in the above table, such issues will default to as if PTT is not active, and can quickly be resolved by ending and beginning the PTT conversation.  To me, the above seems like a minimal way to add this functionality on top of the existing interface without moving anything around, without forcing anyone to adopt, and without disrupting existing patterns of usage, and staying in-line with familiar patterns.  ### Conclusion /TL;DR  Signal is uniquely positioned to offer secure walkie talkie style conversations to groups, teams, and families with the need for real-time communication in short bursts. The feature can be implemented with minimal UI changes and no disruption of existing usage patterns.","closed","feature,","travisfw","2017-04-06T06:48:54Z","2018-04-03T02:15:12Z"

I know my passcode and the keys appear to be intact.  ### Screenshots Fig 1 ![screenshot_20170508-223114](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/954607/25833925/ad1a22d4-3442-11e7-8319-701cfa97750e.png)  Fig 2 ![screenshot_20170508-222228](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/954607/25833928/b447aa86-3442-11e7-8c73-b73f09cb91db.png)  ### Device info **Device:** HTC M8, hw version 5 **Android version:** 6.20.654.3 **Signal version:** 4.1.0  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/32706bddc8b09c4db21520bca8a5a513 [taken ~10 minutes and a reboot after the incident]","closed","","gimbi","2017-05-09T03:08:57Z","2018-04-03T02:42:08Z"

It usually indicates dead phone or battery, that the recepient is no longer available on Signal, wrong recepient, or even some exotic bug in the system, etc. Therefore it would be very practical to have a notification popping up alerting the user that message hasn't been received even after some time.

Both devices are running Signal beta 3.30.4. Alcatel has explicitly enabled ""video calling beta"" feature. Blackberry has it implicitly enabled, as per moxie0's comment in #6272 (""You don't see that settings, it's on by default for you""). [btw, before beta Signal 3.30.3, the Blackberry showed ""Login failed!"" when trying to place a call; now, from 3.30.3, no more ""Login failed!""].  If, instead, I call from the Blackberry the Alcatel, on the Blackberry it seems all ok, ringing tone, but the Alcatel doesnt ring, and shows a missed call just after the Blackberry stops the ringing tone, manually or because of the timeout.  Texts and attachments work ok on both directions (A->B, B->A). Alcatel device can place and receive audio calls correctly to/from other Signal accounts.

"","6602","Cannot receive phone calls or SMSs during a Signal call when on the Three UK network and connected to 4G or Wifi","I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Cannot receive phone calls or SMSs during a Signal call when on the Three UK network and connected to 4G or Wifi.    Three UK has the ""Three inTouch"" app that handles voice calls and SMSs when the phone is connected to 4G or Wifi (com.hutchison3g.threeintouch). In practice this app is some kind of VoLTE/VoWiFi replacement for non-VoLTE/VoWiFi-enabled devices that prevents 3G fallback for incoming calls and also enables calls over WiFi. It doesn't do anything when the phone is connected to 3G.   If a Signal call is started while the phone is connected to 4G or WiFi (and thus the regular calls are being handled by InTouch), InTouch de-registers from the network for the whole duration of the Signal call and no calls or SMSs can be received or sent until the Signal call finishes. The phone appears to be out of mobile coverage to someone trying to call from a traditional network. When the Signal call ends, InTouch re-registers with the network and the phone starts receiving calls / SMSs normally again.    -This bug does not happen when calling using any other apps, including Whatsapp, Skype, Hangouts and Duo. Calls and SMSs can be received while on a Whatsapp/Skype/Hangouts/Duo call regardless of being connected to 3G, 4G or Wifi, and InTouch does not de-register from the network during these calls.    -This bug did not happen with the old RedPhone calls either, it only started happening with the new WebRTC calls.    -This bug does not happen if the phone is connected to 3G.  In a nutshell, it looks like Signal WebRTC calls are breaking Three InTouch.   Incidentally, a very similar issue happened with the early versions of Google Duo, but it was fixed soon after being reported. The only difference was that in that case, InTouch was not just being broken during a Duo call, but every time Duo was on the foreground, regardless of whether a Duo call was in progress or not. Link:   https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/Duo/yX0e4cjT2hI   ### Steps to reproduce - Be on the Three UK network, connected to 4G or Wifi, and using the Three InTouch app (being connected to 3G does not trigger the bug).  - Initiate a Signal (WebRTC) voice call (old RedPhone calls did not trigger this bug).   **Actual result:** Incoming phone calls / SMSs cannot be received during the Signal call. Calling the phone from a traditional network while on a Signal call results in an ""out of coverage"" message. The Three InTouch app de-registers the phone from the network as soon as a Signal call is initiated.   **Expected result:** It should be possible to receive incoming phone calls / SMSs while on a Signal call. Calling the phone from a traditional network while on a Signal call should work. The Three InTouch app should stay registered on the network during a Signal call.   ### Screenshots ![01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28192843/25558454/116aa32e-2d1f-11e7-825c-702abf350fdd.jpg) ![02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28192843/25558457/1fbcd960-2d1f-11e7-961c-057cc9d6ea75.jpg) ![03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28192843/25558458/2322fef4-2d1f-11e7-8488-e95f3af75733.jpg) ![04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28192843/25558459/26f6b52a-2d1f-11e7-80fa-f9cf4e3cf7da.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** Nexus 5 D821 **Android version:** Stock 6.0.1 M4B30Z **Signal version:** 4.5.2 (but this bug happens with every Signal version since WebRTC was introduced)  ### Link to debug log Debug log of successful Signal call while on 4G: no regular phone calls or SMSs can be received until the Signal call has ended. https://gist.github.com/ee60c98e50a43a404f0e63f809da425a","closed","help wanted,","cegg1","2017-04-29T20:14:05Z","2018-04-03T02:29:39Z"

Especially how and with which algorithm. I suppose that the encryption, if there is one, is used from WebRTC. However, I haven't seen the used algorithm in the Session Description when I was debugging the app.  Accordingly to https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal-video-calls-beta/, the **signaling** of calls are **effectively encrypted** through the Signal protocol. However, in the Session Description, there is **_no encryption_** information to **_encrypt streams_**. Normally, if the Session Description is correctly written (with encryption), there is a ""a=crypto:1 AES_128_GCM inline:[Key+Salt] ..."" somewhere in it. Here, this line is missing.  Can you explain me how the streaming encryption is done, with which algorithm and where are lines in source files ?  Sorry for my english.  Have a good day :) ### Steps to reproduce Not applicable.

Please make a copying few messages like a Telegram-style copy. Or just insert empty strings between messages.  1) The first annoying thing is not adding empty string between two different messages. For example, here is a chat:  ``` John: Hello! Could you copy that?   Alex: Hi! Yep, I will try   John: Thank you. Please paste here. ```   What will be if you will select all these message and copy/paste them somewhere? You will see the following:  ``` Hello! Could you copy that? Hi! Yep, I will try Thank you. Please paste here. ```  Absolutely garbage of text, no any splits, you are unable to understand even by splitter - what message was written by who.  So, the first what is very wanted - is to add ""enter"" (empty string) after every inserted to a clipboard buffer message, except the last one. So, in this case you will have:   ``` Hello! Could you copy that?  Hi! Yep, I will try  Thank you. Please paste here. ``` It is not ideal, but it really much better than current behavior.  2) The best result you will get if you also will add (insert) nicknames before every new message from other guy (except a few messages from the same guy), like in Telegram.

This is partial done for people who have no Google Play installed on their devices. A part of this group does not have Google Play installed because they don't want to have proprietary software on their device.  Fortunately, you can use Signal without Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging but unfortunately, the proprietary libraries are still included in Signal's build. Some of these are: ```     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:9.6.1'     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:9.6.1'     compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-places:9.6.1' ```  In my eyes it makes sense to add a fully free and open source gradle build flavor to Signal which builds get published on the website instead of the default Google Play release.

"","6455","Improve voice messaging","I have: - [X] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  Several things should be improved (imho) to make voice messaging as enjoyable as with similar popular messaging services:  - The voice messages' lengths should be displayed next to the them. I always listen to short voice messages even if I don't have much time because I see it won't take long. With longer voice messages, I usually dedicate some time in my day to listen to them later. But one has to know how long the message is going to be before playing it back. Another argument is that when receiving more voice messages than fit on the screen, and listening to them one-by-one, it's easy to loose your current position in the messages if they can't be distinguished from each other. Currently, it's only the timestamp that distinguishes them, often displaying the same time for multiple messages (because they were sent in the same minute) or a very similar time with only a minute difference, which makes it easy to loose your current position. A competing messenger [solves the issue of indistinguishable voice messages with sound graphs](https://telegram.org/file/811140355/1/WIZMMGf4N0o/42aafb28995492f57c). - Rotation should be locked when recording starts. Currently, accidentally tilting your phone while recording rotates the screen and stops the recording. This is especially annoying since voice messaging is mostly used in situations where one can't type well, e.g. when walking on the street, eyes on the road instead of looking at the phone. In this position one doesn't pay much attention to how one is holding the phone because one is concentrating on the surroundings, resulting in accidental tilting that aborts the recording. - Recording voice messages without an active internet connection is a pain, for example on train rides or on vacation. Once a voice message is recorded, it can't be played back until it has been delivered to the server. Re-listening to what one has just said (to avoid repeating oneself) is impossible until the internet connection is reestablished. Instead of replacing the play button with a Spinner (I mean the Android View) to indicate the message is being sent, thus making it unplayable, just display a ""..."" animation like with text messages. - I am unsure if this is already implemented and just doesn't work for me, but holding your phone to your ear or otherwise blocking the proximity sensor doesn't switch audio playback to the earpiece. It works with competing messengers though.  To conclude, a word of compliment: It seems like when sending multiple voice messages with no internet connection, then reconnecting again, sends the messages in the order they were recorded. Some competing messengers do not care to save the order, usually resulting in the smallest/shortest voice message being sent first, and so on, resulting in a weird order that confuses the receiver.","closed","feature,","Lesik","2017-03-28T20:24:31Z","2018-04-03T02:17:54Z"

"","7064","Overall Privacy-Compromise Created by Profile Feature","I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  Not really sure how to report this. I deem that it belongs here since it is not a support request, and is an issue with Signal. But it it is considerably more general than other bug reports.  I have read all of the issue tickets reporting issues with the new profile feature, and all of them identify issues with the way the feature was implemented. None of them speak to the addition of this feature itself as problematic.  I use Signal because it is still the project with the most diligent commitment to smartphone messaging privacy. I have until now had high confidence that Signal development decisions would be smart and levelheaded, and would not compromise my privacy. The addition of the profile feature has shaken that confidence.  The [announcement of the Profile feature in Beta](https://signal.org/blog/signal-profiles-beta/), which I've only now had a chance to read, claims ""All of this is possible without sacrificing the privacy and security that you have come to expect from Signal."" This is not true.  Half of my contacts know me by one name, half by another. It is imperative that there is no crossover between these identities. Furthermore, the gmail account my Android phone is registered under is a third identity. Disclosing that identity to some Signal contacts would represent a catastrophic privacy breach, which could even, hypothetically, endanger my life.  Up until now, there has been no cause for concern in using Signal, as enforcing the segregation of these identities has presented no issues. Signal's design decisions have never presented any threat to this segregation, because the presumption has always been in favour of privacy.  The ""set up your profile"" wizard which announced itself after the update prepopulated the name field with the name associated with my Google account. It would have been very easy to have accidentally accepted this as my profile name. As per the Signal blogpost, this name would then have been visible to all contacts saved in my phone. This decision thoughtlessly left me a single mistake away from a catastrophic privacy breach.  The ""Do It Later"" option was minuscule and dangerously close in the UI to the very large ""Accept"" button. It was initially not visible to me, so it looked as if I was being forced to choose a unitary identity for a Signal instance where I was managing multiple identities. When I did spot it, after a reinstall, several attempts to press it on my large smartphone screen were unsuccessful. It took multiple attempts.   Before I discovered the ""Do it later"" option, my compromise attempt to save an empty profile returned an error message. I also discovered, after temporarily choosing a privacy-preserving pseudonymous profile name (which would nevertheless appear highly incongruous to several of my contacts) that [it is not possible to delete an identity once chosen](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/6960). There is no option to do so, and if you try to save an empty profile it gives you an error. So I had to reinstall the app to delete my profile. And when you do not set up a profile,[ the app harrasses you with persistent notifications](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/6927) to do so during group conversations, as if the decision not to is assumed to be a temporary one by the Signal devs.  There are several bug reports which suggests mitigations for some of these different problems (although not all of them - e.g. I have seen no mention of the prepopulation of the name field as a concern). Fixing each of these problems would indeed have reduced the severity of the threat to privacy represented by the introduction of the feature. (I also imagine there are people who believe that simply adding support for multiple profiles would solve the issue, but in my opinion this would drastically sophisticate the task of managing identities, and result in accidental breaches.)  But fixing each of those issues would not address what seems to me the major issue: that this issue was so thoughtlessly introduced at all. Yes, it is clear that - to preserve my privacy - Signal devs decided it would be unwise to just automatically create a profile for me based on the name associated with my Gmail account. Instead I was given a dialogue with the name prepopulated. But this in itself was dangerous, and the fact that I was subjected to even this danger with apparently no consideration of how it could affect people with multiple identities leaves me with little confidence that similar or worse breaches might be thoughtlessly created in the future, in order to introduce some convenience feature which is secondary to the goal of a truly private messaging application. Using Signal is now fraught with inherent risk, and I am no longer confident that Signal devs have my privacy as their priority.  For me - a Signal user whose privacy is paramount - this profile feature is not a feature but a bug. The utility added to the app by the profile feature, eliminating unknown phone numbers in group conversations, seems to address an edge case at best. It does not enhance the privacy of the user - its only effect on user privacy is to make privacy compromise more likely. I cannot see how its addition necessitates the attendant complexification of the task of staying private while using the app. And the reasoning behind its introduction, in a dev team with a commitment to privacy, is entirely opaque to me.   I submit this issue as a Signal user who values privacy, and who has experienced a privacy scare because of Signal development decisions - something which I am sure should be of concern to a privacy-oriented project. It is considerably longer than a typical bug report, because it speaks to a broader issue. If this issue can be taken on and used to improve matters, that is to the good.   If it is simply the case that Signal is reprioritising, or that it does not intend to cater to users like me with harder privacy requirements than the average (but privacy-conscious) user, that is sad to me, but I accept it. But it also suggests to me that it is misleading to call it Signal Private Messenger, and to entice users with more stringent needs into a potentially risky situation.","closed","","turningdragon","2017-10-07T17:11:52Z","2017-10-08T20:47:25Z"

(akin to temporarily locking a thread or page in other contexts).   Perhaps this whole system could be tucked into a app preference and not displayed by default. There could be a second preference ""respect cooldowns"" which would be enabled by default.  It could be set up such that: one person initiates the cooldown and a second person concurs. This could be presented as a text bubble like, ""XYZ requests a cooldown locking the chat for two minutes"" and a ""Accept"" or ""Decline"" buttons are presented. The second person who approves could then send out a blocking message with the time limit on it.   Then the other clients can disable their send buttons, and a mellow SVG animation with some kind of hourglass or similar would appear, or maybe an abacus subtracting numbers to zero. (like a bigger hourglass than the disappearing messages one, across the whole viewport).   When the cooldown is completed the timer message disappears and the send buttons are enabled again.  I think this could in fact help the user experience significantly by giving a way to let a overall emotional moment blow over for a few minutes and then resume again.

Basically, it doesn't appear that there's any way I can specify an application is ""trusted"" to receive decrypted text messages from Signal. This is probably against the general principle of end-to-end encryption, but it might be worth it so I can use Signal in conjunction with other apps.  Basically, what I'm requesting is a way to indicate to Signal that other apps on the phone (e.g. Google Assistant, Garrulo (an app I wrote - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glasstowerstudios.garrulo&hl=en), etc... can ""read"" text messages (in clear text) from Signal. This is useful, because, when I'm driving, right now, when I ask Google Assistant to read my new SMS messages, it can't see anything inside of Signal.   ### Steps to reproduce - Start Signal on Android, make it the default application for SMS receipt - On another device, send an SMS message (or a Signal message) to the phone in question - Using a hands-free device (or just by talking to your phone), say ""Ok Google. Read text message"" when the new message is received.  **Actual result:** Google will not read clear-text (SMS) messages or encrypted (Signal) messages received within Signal. The last message it will read is the one that verifies my participation in Signal.  **Expected result:** Google assistant will read my newest text message.  I expect that, in order for this to work, I would have to whitelist the application somehow. In that sense, what I'm asking for as a feature here is for Google to be able to ""poll for new messages"" to Signal, once whitelisted.  ### Device info **Device:** LG Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.11.5","closed","","jwir3","2017-10-24T23:17:38Z","2018-04-03T04:44:33Z"

Obviously I only want that for that particular contact.  A further extensions could be repeating until I move a slider from left to right (like in fire alert 2). But for me that is of minor importance. A high repeat factor with a small interval in a *per contact* setting should do.","closed","","rck","2017-07-19T19:54:15Z","2018-04-03T03:38:01Z"

In most IRC clients this works with ``, in Whatsapp a list of users is shown if `@` is entered.  Since the contacts names are not necessarily equal on the different devices, e.g. the phone number can be used internally.  A big advantage of this is, that it enables a personal ""ping"", so that users can mute the group chat but receive notifications if they are personally messaged (similar to IRC).   ### Duplicates I hope this isn't reported somewhere else or already supported.

This interrupts typing, breaks autocorrect, and prevents things like long press to get a symbol (Holding the 'A' key to get the '!').  In addition to the keyboard showing inputs that aren't happening, the number at the top of the screen changes format.  Instead of showing the number below the contact name, it will randomly switch to +xxxxxxxxxx below the contact name instead of xxxxxxxxxx.  Once this happens once, it will continue to randomly Shift throughout the app being open.  No other app on the phone does this when typing.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open messenger on Android 7.0.   - Open an SMS message or a Group message (Happens in both) - Type a word, then punctuate the word with ""!"" by holding the ""A"" key.  **Actual result:**  Keyboard shifts randomly, with the Shift key becoming illuminated or not.  Typing becomes very tedious, as the quick changing of the Shift key seems to interrupt typing.  Number at the top of the screen 'flickers' between two different formats (""xxxxxxxxxx"" and ""+xxxxxxxxxx"").  App must be closed down and reopened to type properly.  Typing may or may not trigger this again before restarting the App. **Expected result:** The message should simply type as I input the proper keys.  ### Screenshots Due to the issue, I'm unable to get a screenshot of it in it's different states, since it happens very rapidly.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S6 **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.3.2  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b7ab2376d7b38b75bc07086e1893bd4f","closed","help wanted,","BitterLies","2017-04-28T14:27:47Z","2018-04-03T02:30:13Z"

It would be very useful if this were visible.  ### Steps to reproduce - use a dual SIM phone with both SIMs active - use Signal as SMS app - use Signal to send SMS to non-Signal contact  **Actual result:** - the active SIM card is visible as ‘filler text’ text in the text box when no text is in the text box (this is good) - once something is in the text box, the active card is not visible anymore (this is inconvenient when one didn't pay attention, or when continuing a concept, or on roaming state change when crossing a border) - to check (by choosing) the active SIM, it is necessary to long-press the send button  **Expected result:** - the active SIM card is visible as ‘filler text’ text in the text box when no text is in the text box - once something is in the text box, the active SIM card color is used to color the send button and a small ‘1’ or ‘2’ (or ‘3’,… for multi-SIM-devices) is put above the arrow (at the horizontal location of the unlocked padlock) in the SMS send button icon  I assume that the SIM number, name, and color are all available through the API; obviously the SIM name is something Signal already uses. But if, for example the SIM color is not easily accessible, using the number as suggested above would already be great. So, my suggestion is just an idea from which you can create the variation that you think is best or most convenient.  P.S.: Signal also provides quick-reply functionality for directly replying to a message; also there some part of my suggestion may be useful, although it is reasonable to restrict active SIM card change to the main interface.   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Duos (GT-i9192) **Android version:** 7.1.2 (LineageOS) **Signal version:** 4.8.1","closed","","equaeghe","2017-08-08T11:34:38Z","2018-04-16T18:34:00Z"

Since `libjingle_peerconnection_so.so` seems to be compiled with the assumption that the device supports NEON and does not check for this during runtime, it crashes on these devices (trace included below). Ideally this should be checked during runtime (like described [here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpu-arm-neon.html#rd)) or a non-NEON version of the library should be loaded on these devices.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use ARMv7 device without NEON support. - Receive or place a Signal call. - libjingle_peerconnection_so.so crashes Signal repeatedly with signal 4 (SIGILL), code 1 (ILL_ILLOPC).  I recompiled the M59 version of the webrtc binaries with these options:  ``` gn gen out/Release --args='target_os=""android"" target_cpu=""arm"" arm_use_neon=false libyuv_use_neon=false rtc_build_with_neon=false is_debug=false' ninja -C out/Release ```  Overwriting `/data/app-lib/org.thoughtcrime.securesms-1/libjingle_peerconnection_so.so` with the newly compiled non-NEON version of `libjingle_peerconnection_so.so` fixes this problem (until the next reboot).  ### Debug log  ``` I/DEBUG   (  129): pid: 14049, tid: 14049, name: crime.securesms  >>> org.thoughtcrime.securesms","closed","","k1521206","2017-08-19T18:06:07Z","2018-04-03T04:18:47Z"

This includes normal messages and also received confirmation (the double check mark). I am however able to send messages (single check mark) and they are also received. Switching back from mobile network to WiFi also does not solve the problem. After reinstalling Signal the bug still persists.  Important: This phone does not have GCM. It appears the websocket pipe gets broken.   ### Steps to reproduce - Switch from WiFi to 3G/LTE (or vice versa)  **Actual result:** Switching to mobile network causes Signal to not receive any push messages **Expected result:** Signal is able to handle the network switch and is able to receive both messages and received confirmations.    ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S4 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.1.0  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/timotk/bad33a0bff9129358938cd2c4f568ada  I believe this is the relevant part:  > 03-27 11:16:39.679 31337 31371 W MessageRetrievalService: Application level read timeout... > 03-27 11:16:39.682 31337 31371 W MessageRetrievalService: Network requirement: true, active activities: 1, push pending: 0, gcm disabled: true > 03-27 11:16:39.684 31337 31371 W MessageRetrievalService: Reading message...","closed","","timotk","2017-03-27T09:52:23Z","2018-04-03T02:18:31Z"

I have made some tests, only on French mobile phone numbers, which are in the format +33 (0)6 xx xx xx xx or +33 (0)7 xx xx xx xx,  and here is what I have observed: - what I have described above applies when the digit right after the leading 6 or 7 changes; - it also applies when you replace the leading 6 by a 7 or the leading 7 by a 6; - it also applies if both conditions above are met; - it seems not to apply when it is another digit which is modified; - it applies both for numbers written with an international dialling code (+33 6 xx xx xx xx) and for numbers written without it (06 xx xx xx xx); - it applies both for signal contacts and non-signal ones; - actually, if the second number is also in the directory and a previous conversation with the first number already exists within Signal, when one tries to start a conversation with the second number, the conversation with the first number opens.   ### Steps to reproduce - Pick up any number in your directory. Let's say it is 06 12 34 57 89, and that the number is the one of  Robert Dupont. - Try to write a message to a number  where the 6 or the 1 (or both) is changed, for instance 07 12 34 57 89 or 06 92 34 57 89, or 07 82 34 57 89. - Alternative to step 2: find a way to receive a message from one number such as the ones mentioned in step 2.  **Actual result:** The conversation which opens is your conversation with Robert Dupont, who has the number  06 12 34 57 89. If you send the message, it is sent to that number.  **Expected result:** The conversation window which opens should correspond to the number you actually typed (or received a message from), and the message should be sent to that same number.  ### Screenshots So, if I type any of the following numbers: ![screenshot_typing_number_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19377750/27769722-96513d26-5f30-11e7-9c6e-837fc11e24b5.png) ![screenshot_typing_number_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19377750/27769725-a26c3aac-5f30-11e7-9eef-f34cf2589c1f.png) ![screenshot_typing_number_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19377750/27769727-abdb6f04-5f30-11e7-9faa-0a5016929f34.png)   When I press ""New message to..."", the conversation window which opens is: ![screenshot_result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19377750/27769728-b0c7c51c-5f30-11e7-95c8-5483de31c60a.png) (with the contact ""Contact"" owning the number +33612345789 previously added in my directory)   ### Device info **Device:** HUAWEI G740-L00 **Android version:** 4.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.6.1  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/efed29ecd96d3ec8728c894903a43e3d","closed","","lemeda","2017-07-02T12:21:11Z","2018-04-03T02:53:58Z"

Many of my contacts have signal installed but still use SMS separately, or use iPhones where they cannot use signal for SMS.  When a Signal contact sends me an SMS message, the Signal default is to respond via a Signal message, which is confusing for the other party and inconvenient for the user, who has to remember to change the mode to SMS. This discourages users from using Signal as their SMS client.  ### Steps to reproduce Receive an SMS from a phone number registered with Signal.  **Actual result:** The user responds with a Signal message, which may appear differently on the recipient's device and cause confusion. **Expected result:** The Signal app should either match the sender's mode of communication (perhaps with a warning about encryption) OR remember the user's preference for that contact across restarts of the app.  ### Screenshots Friend sends an SMS.

Both phones are set to synch to carrier time.  ### Steps to reproduce * Make phone A call phone B in Signal * Observe that phone B gets no notification about the incoming call just the missed one.  ### Device info  **Device:** Sony F5121 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.14.10  ### Link to debug log   Callee debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9984ab543d85a181b06b02954564c060 Caller debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5eae662fee114e5e07a72dbd02c0e92d","closed","","szotsaki","2018-01-03T17:07:51Z","2018-04-03T04:57:05Z"

(Signal strips the % and B, then prepends +1 to the resulting number.) **Expected result:** Signal creates a new message to +18005551212.  ### Device info OnePlus 3T running latest LineageOS  ### Notes: - Google's SMS app (com.google.android.apps.messaging) handles this url as described in ""Expected Behavior"" above. - The sms: urls described in RFC 5724 use an actual + sign, rather than url-encoding the plus sign as %2B. As such, it's not clear whether my example URL should be valid or not. However, it is obvious how this URL is intended to be parsed, and some developers do create SMS urls this way. - The Lyft android app is an example of an app that generates sms: urls with %2B in place of the plus sign. As such, this app works with the built-in SMS app, but breaks with Signal.","closed","","praxiq","2017-04-08T18:28:07Z","2018-04-03T02:14:16Z"

They also do not show up under the documents tab of the media library for that conversation.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a file to someone, using desktop client - Attempt to open or save them on Android client - The files are unknown and inaccessible - Check all media and the documents tab and they will not be there either  Issue originally opened here: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop/issues/1853 (worked with Scott to figure out what is going on, he was able to reproduce the issue and found it to be an Android client issue, could not reproduce on iOS client and was suggested I open this issue here)  Issue similar to https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/6791 (except not just for PDF but for ANY file type - list of tested types so far mentioned above) and the system contains viewers for all these file types and they work normally outside of the client, the issue is not opening them but rather that you can't open or save them at all, they basically show up as an entry with unknown as the file name and nothing more can be done with them.  **Actual result:** The files are not accessible and marked as unknown under the Android side for anything sent either via Desktop client to someone. **Expected result:** Files should be properly listed with their names and be accessible to open or save and appear under the documents tab of the all media library.  ### Screenshots Screenshots available at the referenced original issue above but do not reveal anything special beyond what is described.  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Nexus 6 (shamu) **Android version:** Nougat 7.1.1 (stock N6F27M) **Signal version:** 4.14.3 (beta)  ### Logs https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f06a523736972102de8f296e85c224fc  I would be happy to provide anything else you need and as with Scott, we worked directly with each other to send stuff so we can see the behavior, if anyone needs me to use the special debug build and do the same, be happy to do it, just give me a way to contact you privately like with Scott.

This behavior started before Burning Man, but I didn't have time to troubleshoot it then, and I had my phone off that week & Labor Day weekend anyway. I was hoping it was a transient issue that would somehow work itself out when I came back to cell signal, but no such luck.  I didn't get a chance to poke at it until this weekend, when I went to the Play Store to see if there was any update to the Signal app.  Updating to 4.9.9 gave me the ability to enter my passphrase once, and I could see my conversation list for a moment, but then an ""updating database"" screen came up, stayed for about 60 seconds, and then Signal crashed again. After it stopped during the ""updating database"" it's back to the same behavior (crash at the ""enter passphrase"" screen) as before the update.

I looked at issue #6948 but this doesn't appear to be a duplicate (different platform, different logcat errors)  ### Steps to reproduce This happens every time I try to open Signal.  **Actual result:** When I tap the Signal icon, it flashes the ""Enter passphrase"" screen and then crashes, and I get the ""Unfortunately, Signal has stopped"" Android error.  **Expected result:** When I tap the Signal icon, it allows me to enter my passphrase and access my messages.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** LG G3 LGLS990 **Android version:** 4.4.2 **Signal version:** 4.9.9  My phone is rooted.  ### Link to debug log I can't capture a debug log because it won't run, but attached is the adb logcat.

But not all recipients had received the message. Also, the verification decision I made for a user didn't show up in the conversation view or on my linked desktop install.  ### Steps to reproduce   - In a group with four participants, all are verified   - Keeping the conversation open, two participants reregister   - Attempt to send a message   - Get an error in the conversation, and you can tap the message for more information. You see two errors, with view buttons.   - Tap the first 'view' button, and see a dialog explaining the situation. Tap Accept. First error is now gone.   - Tap the second 'view' button, see the dialog, tap the text to take you to the safety number screen. Then back out of all that - tapping cancel on the dialog, then back to the conversation view.  ### Actual/expected 1. The conversation view no longer shows an error. Expected the message to still have the red icon. One recipient never got the message, but the conversation view shows no error. 2. The decision I made about that first user's new identity key was not added to the conversation view. This was also not sync'd to the linked desktop, so a message sent from desktop ran into the two identity key errors even though a verification decision had happened on Android.  ### Device info **Device:** Moto G5 Plus **Android version:** Android 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.7.4  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/183b9ff4e8104a092b18eec0a95624b1","closed","","scottnonnenberg","2017-06-29T21:17:47Z","2018-04-03T02:54:11Z"

Other similar bugs mentioned that power saving may be an issue. Via the ""Security"" app in the MIUI I set battery saver to ""Off"", and under ""App Battery Saver"", Signal has a custom setting  of ""No Restrictions"".  ### Steps to reproduce I cannot consistently reproduce the bug. Steps that have caused it in the past: - Signal is open in the background (i.e., I have recently used it, have not closed it via the task manager, but have used other apps since opening it) - Contact sends a text message to me - I open the signal app - I send a message back to the contact  **Actual result:** The message they sent appears only after I have sent another message back to them **Expected result:** The message from the contact should be received as soon as it is sent  ### Screenshots In the screenshot you can see that the final message shown was from 39 minutes ago, yet was delivered after the message I sent 22 minutes ago. This was because the final message was only delivered after I sent the second-last message. This means that in the debug log, it will be around 16:49 when the message was finally displayed, thought it may have been received any time after 16:32. Line 532 is right around the time this would have happened. ![screen shot 2017-11-27 at 5 13 38 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8398540/33292220-74303d66-d396-11e7-8779-636f62f75e63.png)    ### Device info Device  : Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (mido) Android : 7.0 (V9.0.3.0.NCFMIEI, AL1512-mido-build-20171028011511) Memory  : 34M (24.05% free, 512M max) Memclass: 192 OS Host : mi-server App     : Signal 4.12.3  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6848cc7789aefa05008659a5c4f3caa1","closed","","sam-jaques","2017-11-27T22:23:48Z","2018-04-03T04:49:27Z"

Since on my P9 I use Signal for all communiction SMS get to Signal conversation flow. If the contact that have passively abadoned signal write an SMS it gets listed and Signal defaults to send them an answer over data service, which the doesent reach the Phone of the SMS message received before. This is very bad. Moste of the time I am aware the person doesnt use Signal and chose SMS to sen dthe message but sometimes I forget it and the to be receiving person is going to be upset because she doesn't receive an answer. ### Steps to reproduce - register mobile number A for signal - delete app from phone of user A - send an SMS from user A to B - B uses Signal Android as SMS App - B receives SMS message insecure - B knows A has removed Signal from phone and wants to write back but forgets to choose SMS for sending the message - A doesn't receive the message because it never contacts the server    **Actual result:**  contact doesn't receive an answer **Expected result:**  Either the receiver should get the message over the way he sent it to the receiver or the sender should be made aware the receiver probably doesn't uses signal anymore or  sms should be a default option to chose from in contact setting  There are some workaround for this - drop SMS on Android app altogether (which is a no brainier in myy eyes) - make trafic type selection permanent, in user settings, which would just wire up some available functions as defaults (workaround) - implement active database , eg a number doesn't communicate once in a (to be defined, weeks/months ) timeframe to the server (connect to server not sending receiving a message) either   1.  drop the number from Secure user circle  2. or notify the sender of a data message the chat partner has seen no data usage recently and my not receive the message in time (optimal, but provides probably meta data leak)  ### Device info  **Device:** HUaweii P9 to iPhone 6 **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** All until to date as of writing","closed","","OlHeNi","2017-06-08T20:06:20Z","2018-05-18T20:05:47Z"

Using Signal only through WiFi. Signal seems to be recognizing there is no SIM card, as if it has lost contact with the SIM or it is a dual-SIM phone (it is not). So every time a contact's message page is opened, an empty popup asks to ""Select SIM card"" and there is none to select. This doesn't make Signal very user-friendly since you have to hit outside the popup before reading or sending a message. And this happens over and over again every time you click on a contact's name to send a message or see what was sent.  ### Steps to reproduce - Take out phone's SIM card. - While SIM card is out of phone, try to send a message to a contact.  **Actual result:** ""Select SIM card"" popup will be there every time.  **Expected result:** ""Select SIM card"" popup will not be there every time.

I changed phone numbers and devices, added my new number and removed my old number from a few large groups.  A small fraction of group members didn't receive the update (maybe due to key changes, but I don't know).  Some weeks later, these group members have updated the group to add new members or change the group name, and this had the practical effect of propagating their device's view of the member list to everyone else in the group, resurrecting my membership and exposing the new owner of my old phone number to group messages.  #6177 mostly describes a nuisance of continuing to receive messages from people that didn't get your ""leave group"" event.  My issue feels more like a security concern, since my old group membership gets re-propagated to everyone in the group even if I don't have control of the original device or number anymore.  ### Steps to reproduce - join a large group - have a member of the group change their key and don't accept the change - leave the group - observe that most members no longer see you're a member - cancel your phone service and recycle your phone - have the member that didn't get your ""leave group"" event make a change to the group  **Actual result:** The previously-left number is re-added to the group **Expected result:** The previously-left number should get propagated somehow to the group member that didn't get the memo and the old number should not be re-added to the group.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel XL   **Android version:** 7.1.1   **Signal version:** 3.31.4","closed","","dnesting","2017-03-15T15:48:42Z","2018-04-03T02:06:33Z"

Here they are (in order of importance): 1. There is too much empty space between messages from the same person. The amount of space is OK for messages from two different people but that space is too much for messages from the same person. I often express my point in several consecutive messages and the spaces are breaking the flow. Right now you could fit about two extra lines between the text of two consecutive messages. 3. Similarly it's not necessary to display the profile picture for every message. In one-on-one chat you actually don't need the pictures at all. But I'm less sure if this is actually an issue.  **Actual result:** a lot of space between messages which interrupts the flow of conversation **Expected result:** good use of space","closed","","thomkeh","2017-05-14T14:39:31Z","2017-05-15T09:17:32Z"

One of them has been closed and the other two could've been filed in a more structured way so I'm opening this one hoping we can move this conversation forward in a constructive way.  The problem is that Google App Engine blocks connection from Iran and this renders the anti censorship feature of signal useless for Iranian people. This is important now as the authorities are trying to shut down all the secure messaging platforms following the uprising and economical protests. Additionally, Telegram, -the main social media and messaging app for Iranian people-, has been blocked recently and this gives us a golden chance to help people adopt Signal. All it takes is to make sure all the Iranian numbers are being routed through a meek server that is not Google.  We at Tor, have tested both Azure and Amazon and they work perfectly fine. I assume this is gonna be the same with other major CDNs as well.  ### Steps to reproduce - Try to connect to Signal servers from an Iranian IP address  **Actual result:** Connection fails due to censorship. **Expected result:** OWS needs to either switch to, or add new meek servers on a platform that isn't Google App Engine and Signal should automatically enable censorship circumvention feature for Iranian phone numbers (+98).   ### Device info  **Device:** Any device **Android version:** Any device both Anodrid and iOS  Here are some additional info for the curious mind: https://twitter.com/CDA/status/947556800328433664 and https://twitter.com/mrphs/status/947601608061353984  Please help us to enable and empower millions of vulnerable people to communicate securely with making this change.","closed","","mrphs","2018-01-01T21:24:45Z","2018-01-02T18:49:45Z"
"","6417","Manual MMS Settings Missing","I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description The underlying problem is that my MMS messages are not being sent correctly in a group chat. My contact says that ""I can see some of your message until I open it up. Then the phone converts it to a MMS & I can no longer see what you said."".  I am using Sprint, and on some other issues I saw that on Sprint it may be necessary to go into Signal's manual MMS settings and set a different MMS server from whatever it defaults to.  However, the manual MMS settings are missing on my copy of Signal. Under Settings -> SMS and MMS, I have only three options: ""SMS Enabled"", ""SMS delivery reports"", and ""'WiFi Calling' comparability mode"". There also does not appear to be any relevant option in the ""Advanced"" section if the settings.  Searching the source code for ""Manual MMS Settings"" reveals a bunch of hits, so I assume the settings have not been removed, and that they are just not appearing on my device.  How do I make the manual MMS settings appear so I can apply the Sprint MMS workaround?  ### Steps to reproduce - Have a Sprint LG G2 - Open Signal's SMS and MMS Settings  **Actual result:** No Manual MMS Settings option appears **Expected result:** A Manual MMS Settings option should appear  ### Screenshots  http://m.imgur.com/QmuD83z ### Device info **Device:** LG G2 **Android version:** 5.0.2 **Signal version:** 3.31.4  ### Link to debug log  https://gist.github.com/660f15e53aa9639df0d16afd6fed2465","closed","","interfect","2017-03-19T21:56:07Z","2018-04-03T02:05:38Z"

E. g. in Android 8 (Oreo), the ""path"" for those settings differs. Not sure right now about other Android versions, but I guess they differ somewhat as well.  I'm not sure how to solve this nicely, though. Is it possible that Signal does the work for the user and opens the correct settings page for each Android version?

(For me four contacts/groups were shown) - Go into an app, from where you can share stuff (such as an image) in the gallery app. - Share the picture. - Let the share window pop up (see screenshot). **Actual result:** The default icon for a group is very small. **Expected result:** The icon should be normal size.  ### Further Info When clicking on the Signal Icon in the share window then the list of the contacts/groups appears and there all icons have the correct size.

Since Signal already sets `android:largeHeap`, the relevant limit is returned by `getLargeMemoryClass`, [as per the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getLargeMemoryClass()). I think this is behind the effect where some devices can easily send higher resolution images over other messaging apps (e.g. Whatsapp) but get a rather low memory class rating in Signal and compress the images too much as a result.","closed","","dkasak","2017-07-19T13:49:29Z","2017-07-21T23:02:21Z"

Starts loading and then halfway through it goes back to spinning again  I have no idea why this happens, the phone has plenty of free memory and the delete timer is set to 1 day so the chat isn't bloated at all. This has been happening for several months now and it's getting really annoying.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Receive a video (It doesn't happen every time) 2. Wait for it to finish loading... 3. Oh wait! It never does! 4. Restart the device 5. It now works just fine  **Actual result:** Videos get stuck downloading until a restart **Expected result:** Videos should never get stuck   ### Device info Device  : motorola MotoG3 (osprey_reteu) Android : 6.0.1 (2, MPIS24.107-55-2-5) Memory  : 31M (14.53% free, 256M max) Memclass: 96, low-mem device OS Host : ilclbld36 App     : Signal 3.30.4  In the most recent debug log below: App     : Signal 4.1.0  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/494993a950189778dc6e6d7f469d1e58 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0c21e2e84df4dcc8a7a3ecb3af8a34b7","closed","","Dyras","2017-04-01T11:50:40Z","2017-04-29T21:34:07Z"

They misinterpret the menu item '*Leave group*' as '*Leave current group chat back to chat overview pane*'. I see several possible enhancements: - Change menu text to '*[End | Cancel | Terminate] my group membership*'. This was an easy change which should clarify the purpose of this menu item. - Enhance confirmation dialogue like it is in Signal / iOS. Add a clarifying sentence, what it means to leave the group. - Add a menu item '*Back to chats overview*' for people who are looking for this functionality. - Move '*Leave group*' menu item to the '*Edit group*' submenu. Maybe you should be able to remove yourself from the group at the same place where you can add people to the group.   I'd prefer the combination of moving this item to the '*Edit group*' submenu and enhancing the confirmation dialogue like it is in Signal / iOS. But this might be (to) much work for a minor issue...  ### Steps to reproduce - Give unexperienced user a device with Signal - Ask him to open an existing group chat - Ask him to leave this chat back to chats overview  **Actual result:** People sometimes open 3dot-menu and choose '*Leave group*' and ignore or misunderstand confirmation dialogue. **Expected result:** People always understand purpose of '*Leave group*' item and never accidentally leave the group.  ### Screenshots None.  I don't think screenshots are helpful here and i'm lazy ;-)  ### Device info not reasonable, device-independent issue.  ### Link to debug log not reasonable as it works like it is designed.","closed","","wizardofid","2017-06-05T13:47:11Z","2018-04-03T02:57:43Z"

This behaviour persists even if Signal is given full access to both WiFi and cellular connections in NetGuard. This behaviour is unique to cellular data connections. Signal works properly on WiFi while NetGuard is active.  It is not yet clear whether the problem is in Signal or in NetGuard. If it turns out to be the latter, then a help / faq page saying ""NetGuard breaks Signal, there's just no way to make it work, here are alternatives / workarounds"" would be a good idea.  Running without NetGuard or a similarly capable alternative is not a workaround, as that would permit other apps to quickly gobble up mobile data (which, in this case, is expensive and in extremely limited supply).  ### Steps to reproduce Debug log attached, generated as follows: - While an active WiFi connection is present, close and then start Signal. - Verify that NetGuard is set normally (firewall is on, Signal has full access for both WiFi and cellular modes). - Move outside the range of the WiFi connection. Device automatically switches to LTE connection. - Attempt to send a plain text message in Signal.       **Actual result:** Get a ""failed to send message"" error.       **Expected result:** Message is sent, shows 1 checkbox (sent), shortly thereafter shows 2 checkboxes (received). - Turn off NetGuard entirely. - Try sending the message again in signal.       **Actual result:** Message is sent correctly.       **Expected result:** No change. - Re-enable NetGuard and move back into WiFi range.      **Actual result:** Signal works normally.  ### Device info **Device:** LGE Nexus 5 (hammerhead) **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.1.0  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d9a7d59b0737474aec9191101ee182a5","closed","","marshmat","2017-04-03T17:53:39Z","2017-04-04T11:52:38Z"

The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377, https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/2285#issuecomment-218601632 etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI.  It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol.  (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285, https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/845#issuecomment-134381412 etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678, #2847, #3074, #4009, #5001)","closed","feature,","Lenbok","2017-03-15T06:01:13Z","2018-04-03T02:06:55Z"

When this happens, I don't get a notification sound either. The fact that I get only one short vibration and no sound leads to me missing the fact that I have received a message. This happens even though all sounds in the system, as well as the vibration, are turned on.  If I get another message a few seconds later, the behaviour is often the way it should be with the usual pattern and a notification sound.  The bug appears as follow: - A message is received. - If the normal vibration pattern of Signal is assumed to be approximately (250 ms vibration, 250 ms without vibration, 250 ms vibration), the vibration I get is more like 50 ms vibration and then nothing more. Thus, I get ONE very short vibration and not a pattern like I usually do, and there is no notification sound.  ### Steps to reproduce - Unknown, although I have tried to find out how to reproduce this during the past few months. - I most often experience the problem when the phone is lying on a table. It is possible it happens with the phone in a pocket as well. The vibration is so short I'm not sure I would feel it if the phone is in a pocket. - The screen appears to have to be turned off, usually for a while.  **Actual result:** A message is received and I only get ONE short vibration instead of a vibration pattern. I get no notification sound. **Expected result:** A message is received and I get the usual vibration pattern (250 ms vibration, 250 ms without vibration, 250 ms vibration) and a notification sound.  ### Device info **Device:** Google Nexus 5X **Android version:** 7.1.2 (stock, unrooted) but had the problems on 7.1.1 as well **Signal version:** 4.3.2  ### Link to debug log Update: https://gist.github.com/ecd9eceea928b11d171beb4beba05dac Happend with the screen on while holding the phone in my hand","closed","","kwlg","2017-04-28T20:55:40Z","2018-04-03T02:29:50Z"

On earlier versions of Android (pre 8.1), this notification was present but low priority, and therefore did not have an icon in the status bar and did not show up on the lock screen. It only was visible in the expanded notification drawer.  On Android 8.1, however, the background connection notification is visible in both the status bar and the lock screen notification view. Furthermore, it uses the same icon as incoming Signal messages, creating the effect that a message notification is always present and causing user confusion. (See annotated screenshots.)  ### Steps to reproduce - run Signal on a device running Android 8.1 without Google Play Services - look at the lock screen or status bar  **Actual result:** background connection notification is shown in the status bar and lock screen. **Expected result:** background connection notification should only be shown in the notification drawer, and the Signal icon should not be present, per previous versions.  ### Screenshots Standard usage of the device, without any dismissable message notifications. (The icon in the status bar is from the background connection notification.) ![screenshot_20171207-232132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3037552/33751266-be67a59a-dba7-11e7-9d08-d03c1f44aad3.png)  Standard usage of the device, with an undismissed notification. Note how two Signal icons are present in the status bar, one from the message and the other from the background connection notification. ![screenshot_20171207-232226](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3037552/33751284-dc1cc318-dba7-11e7-9193-91216ddc5194.png)  The expanded notification drawer. ![screenshot_20171207-232236](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3037552/33751300-045ed41a-dba8-11e7-8eb1-4998c09aee97.png)  _(Irrelevant sections of screenshots removed for privacy.)_  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel **Android version:** 8.1.0 (without Google Play Services; running CopperheadOS, like raw AOSP) **Signal version:** 4.13.6","closed","","milesmcc","2017-12-08T04:43:10Z","2018-01-03T21:31:17Z"

The problem is that while the phone always beeps when she gets a new message, the beep is often really quiet/short when the screen is on and she's already in a conversation with me. ""In-conversation notifications"" is enabled, which is why it beeps at all. However, it seems the message is marked as ""read"" too quickly, so the beep is interrupted. My mom is old and she just can't hear the beep which means she can't respond right away when I'm texting her at the supermarket or whatever.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Receive a message when your screen is on with the chat open, make sure ""In-conversation notifications"" is enabled in the settings 2. Most of the time the notification beep is really short, which makes it easy to miss  **Actual result:** The beep is seemingly interrupted **Expected result:** The beep is fully played, just like you'd expect it to  ### Device info Moto G3 Latest non-beta Signal Android 6.0.1  ### Link to debug log Don't think this is necessary, but if it is just tell me and I'll post one","closed","","Dyras","2017-03-08T15:29:57Z","2017-06-11T10:33:49Z"

Upon receiving a MMS message, LED and notification icon both appear but notification sound/vibration does not occur and message does not download. Messages can then go unnoticed until phone checked for other reasons. After opening signal or opening and unlocking signal, MMS messages promptly download as expected and only then does sound/vibrate occur. In the case of group messages they show as numerous new texts from individual users but then download sequentially and are placed in a single group automatically (time stamps indicate actual download time regardless of send time or how long they have been in limbo). Wi-fi connection does not seem to make a difference. After opening, MMS response time seems improved for short period and messages will download as expected.

MMS set to auto fetch all types in all situations in Signal settings Signal ""doze"" turned off, background data unrestricted pnf - no root app doesn't seem to help either Issue is not new and has been occurring for some time which and has led to use of alternative messaging apps from time to time however built in and all other 3rd party apps work as expected  ### Steps to reproduce - allow signal to be idle for period - receive MMS message - failure of notification - open signal to receive message and notification  **Actual result:** SMS and signal messages notify with sound/vibrate/LED and icon as soon as they arrive.

If one opens that conversation and a second message arrives, the label changes to ""2 unread messages"", which is actually not true. In fact the conversation view is not able to know if someone read a message or not. That's only known by the reader himself. I mean, I'm staring at the screen reading the new messages and Signal is telling me that I haven't read the messages!?  The truth is that I did not answer the 2 messages mentioned before, that's why the label stays where it is. But: why should it be useful to see a label right under my last answer telling me that I did not write anything since then? That's just logical.  In conclusion this label is just useless in my opinion.

After installing the ROM I registered my device and tried to restore the backup. That seemed to work fine but on closer inspection it turned out that group chats had been split into separate conversations, one for each person in the chat. So, for example, if I was in a group chat with Tom and Jerry, I would now have one chat with Tom (with all messages he sent to the group) and one for Jerry (with his messages). The group chat was not restored at all.   ### Steps to reproduce - Use Signal like normal (I did use a custom build with layout changes I've been working on with my own signing key, version 4.6.0), participate in group chats - Create a backup in Signal - Install a custom ROM (Lineage OS in my case). I wiped everything like system, cache, etc, except the internal storage (data) partition. - Reinstall Signal - Import the backup you've created earlier   **Actual result:** Group chats are imported as separate chats for each person participating in the chat. **Expected result:** Group chats should be restored the way I backed them up, so all the messages from that group should appear in that group chat.   ### Screenshots Omitted because privacy and I don't have photoshop at hand to do some blurring.   ### Device info  **Device:** Moto X 2014 (victara) xt1092 **Android version:** 6.0.0 (stock moto) -> 7.1.2 lineage os nightly june 2nd **Signal version:** 4.6.0 / 4.6.1  ### Link to debug log Sorry, don't have that..","closed","","rejhgadellaa","2017-06-09T12:40:05Z","2017-06-12T14:43:53Z"

Refreshing Signal's contact list manually always corrects the situation. This happens pretty often, i. e. > 25 % of the time ~~when Signal is not in the RAM anymore~~.  Again, the phone numbers aren't swapped. They stay at their ""correct"" places all the time. Which with the swapped names/avatars of course means that e. g. under the letter ""M"", you have an entry with name and avatar of ""Jxxxxx"", while the corresponding phone number is ""Mxxxxx""'s.  PS: Don't know if this is important here, but ""Mxxxxx"" used to have dual SIM.  Edit: As pointed out by @AndHell , the affected contacts are always **the 6th and the 8th contact of the list**. Edit: As an alternative to refreshing the contact list, leaving and re-opening it seems to work as well.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Launch Signal when it's not pre-loaded into memory 2. Open contact list & dismiss keyboard 3. Notice issue 4. Refresh or leave and re-open contact list 5. Notice everything's correct now  ### Screenshots  **Screenshot at step 3:** ![screenshot_20170403-034953 markup small](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12624674/24654170/de25fbc0-1938-11e7-97b6-3d60281f9f9a.png)  **Screenshot at step 5:** ![screenshot_20170403-035024 markup small](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12624674/24654180/e81ff702-1938-11e7-85ed-8527de1ea7bb.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 5X **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.2.2  ### Link to debug log  Taken at step 5, i. e. after refreshing the contact list. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cb0f2786a618aae220e2fdbc613a59df","closed","","RiseT","2017-04-03T19:57:44Z","2017-10-05T21:34:43Z"

(Signal would ideally need a way to identify when two copies are received, one via SMS/MMS and one via Signal when cellular or Wifi permits the original message to arrive)  For many people, the encrypted nature of Signal messages is less important than a single, reliable messaging app, and these people are nonetheless important for growing the Signal user base.

I tried hard and searched but found no way to get rid of this banner.  Profiles have been fairly recently added, and they're great! I am sure many people love them. However, I'd prefer to not use them, and I expect Signal to respect that choice. Right now, I have to say I feel coerced by Signal to use profiles. On first startup, when it asked to enter profile data, there was not even an option to say ""No thanks, I don't want a profile"" -- there only was ""fill profile data later"". That's the kind of UI I expect from software disrespecting their users, software that primarily wants to extract user's data. I am aware Signal does that, but then I have to wonder why the UI clearly tells me that the software does not want me to choose to not have a profile.  In every group chat, there now is a banner that lets me share my (empty) profile with the group. Clicking it, I again have the choice between sharing now (which I don't want to do) and cancelling, which leaves the banner enabled. There is no option, it seems (or it is well hidden), to just make the banner go away without enabling profile sharing.  ### Steps to reproduce - Never enter any data into the profile - Join a group chat. There's a banner there taking ~15-20% of the screen space. - Try to get rid of the banner that tells me that I can share my profile with the group. I tried swiping, tapping, and I went through the entire settings dialogue.  **Actual result:** The banner persists, in all group chats. **Expected result:** There should be a way to make the banner go away without enabling profile sharing. Actually, given that my profile is empty, it should not even show the banner.   ### Device info  **Device:** Moto E2 2015 LTE **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.10.9","closed","","RalfJung","2017-09-15T07:59:15Z","2018-04-03T04:28:29Z"

The client uses the credentials that were valid before unregistering, and the server accepts them: they are still valid. This means two things:  - There is a bug in the (websocket) client, which keeps connecting even when it shouldn't. This is quite bad, as no contact to the server is expected when the push functionality is disabled. - The server doesn't really delete the account when the push functionality is disabled. This is even worse, as the users expects any trace of their account to disappear after unregistering. Even commercial, non privacy-centric services promise this.  ### Steps to reproduce - Register to Signal - Unregister - Monitor the app's connections. - If running an instance of Signal-Server: check the server log.  ### Device info  **Signal version:** 4.5.3-website","closed","","paride","2017-05-09T13:44:38Z","2018-04-03T02:41:47Z"

My old phone broke, and I got lent one by a friend, Samsung S3 (model GT-I9300), running CyanogenMod (11.0-InstallerXNPQ32P) with android 4.4.4 which is old but they asked me not to reflash it as it had some tools that were hard to set up and worked which they didn't want breaking.  The google play framework was out of date, so couldn't install via the play store, instead getting the apk from https://signal.org/android/apk/ and installing it. I have swapped sims from old phone, and started up signal, registered and sent test message to my friend which worked, they could send one back and that worked. Later I asked someone from a group chat I was in to send a message to the group, and it came through, but now everytime I open the app it crashes with the stack trace shown below. I get notifications fine, but whenever I go into the app it crashes.  I cleared data and reinstalled the apk and it still does this repeatably.  It also has xposed framework on it, but I couldn't see how to disable that so unsure if it is interfering.  I'm just wondering whether this would be an issue with: - signal - old cyanogen - old gapps - xposed  Attached the logs below, let me know if you need more than that.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have a group chat on one phone - Register a new device running outdated software? - Receive a group chat message  **Actual result:** Crash **Expected result:** Signal works as normal, can view group chat messages, no crash.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S3 (model GT-I9300) **Android version:** 4.4.4 **Signal version:** 4.10.12  ### Link to debug log ``` E/AndroidRuntime( 5212): FATAL EXCEPTION: JobConsumer-0 E/AndroidRuntime( 5212): Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 5212 E/AndroidRuntime( 5212): java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot set request property after connection is made E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at com.android.okhttp.internal.http.HttpURLConnectionImpl.setRequestProperty(HttpURLConnectionImpl.java:508) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at com.android.okhttp.internal.http.HttpsURLConnectionImpl.setRequestProperty(HttpsURLConnectionImpl.java:294) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.push.PushServiceSocket.downloadAttachment(PushServiceSocket.java:468) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.push.PushServiceSocket.retrieveAttachment(PushServiceSocket.java:372) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.whispersystems.signalservice.api.SignalServiceMessageReceiver.retrieveAttachment(SignalServiceMessageReceiver.java:119) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.whispersystems.signalservice.api.SignalServiceMessageReceiver.retrieveAttachment(SignalServiceMessageReceiver.java:88) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.AvatarDownloadJob.onRun(AvatarDownloadJob.java:85) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MasterSecretJob.onRun(MasterSecretJob.java:18) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.runJob(JobConsumer.java:76) E/AndroidRuntime( 5212):        at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.run(JobConsumer.java:46)  ```","closed","","hughdavenport","2017-09-29T01:09:19Z","2017-09-29T02:14:17Z"

If VPN is connected, Signal takes forever to connect an incoming call (up to 250 seconds, that 's long...)  The VPN is shadowsocks-based, tested for general VoIP compatibility via Groundwire client and callcentric's VoIP service, with very good results, under 5s from call initiation to call connection, good quality.  The issue was also replicated on Mullvad VPN with usual android OpenVPN client (exactly same behavior)  So it is not an issue specific to a particular VPN implementation or server/client config.  Also, it's not a push issue groundwire uses push too Also, to further verify it's no a GCM/push issue, PNF Root app was installed and yet another incoming call via Signal was attempted. With other person trying to Signal-call the phone behind VPN, phone showed  no signs of being called for 149 seconds, while, during all this time, the GCM log courtesy of PNF Root app showed numerous push messages from whispersystems/Signal  NB: Signal text messages are not affected and are delivered instantly  ### Steps to reproduce - Install an android VPN (any Shadowsocks or OpenVPN one seems to do) - connect it - test that signal works by exchanging text messages - try to call the phone behind VPN   **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  The incoming call takes unreasonably long to connect   **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Somewhat more reasonable time between ""other party initiated call"" and phone actually ringing. Maybe like, 5 - 15 seconds  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Tested and reproduced on Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, Xiaomi Redmi Pro, Elephone P7000 **Android version:** Different android versions, Android 6 on Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, various Android 5 (vendor ROMs) on Xiaomi Redmi Pro, Elephone P7000 **Signal version:** 4.1.0  ### Link to debug log","closed","","BurnySnek","2017-04-03T13:19:46Z","2018-04-03T02:16:10Z"

Messages are received upon a reboot. Chrome app on desktop continues to work fine.  ### Steps I took  - Earlier today, everything was fine, and I was chatting away happily via my Android device.   - I then chatted a bit via the app on my desktop. Walked away from my computer and opened up the Android app again and tried to send a message, but it failed. Attempted to retry, and it failed again.  - Went back to my computer, and sent a message via the desktop. It was received fine. Got a reply as well. Everything seemed fine from the desktop perspective, but none of the messages were received on my phone.  - Attempted to open the ""linked devices"" list and I get a ""Network connection failed"" error dialog.  - Attempted to deregister the device, as per https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/216948747-What-do-I-do-if-I-see-Network-connection-failed-,  and I get ""Error connecting to server!"" popping up in the middle-bottom of the screen briefly.  - Rebooted phone, opened Signal, and the intervening messages all were delivered. Repeated above steps and no messages arrived on my phone and none could be sent.  **Actual result:** The Android app only receives messages after a reboot, and cannot send messages, manage linked devices, or deregister. **Expected result:** The Android app should be able to send and receive messages normally, open and manage the list of linked devices, and deregister if desired.  **Note:** I'm ""still"" using the Chrome app on this desktop, having never migrated because the standalone app's GTK usage doesn't play well with my KDE theme or DPI settings. I do have the standalone app installed on another desktop PC (which is how I became aware of the GTK-related problems), and the Chrome app configured on a ChromeOS laptop (which obviously couldn't run the standalone app even if I wanted to there), but I haven't had a chance yet to see if they are also still working.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel XL (marlin) **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.13.6 (from Play Store)  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fc26f282c52288f71392732eb86410f4","closed","","keithzg","2017-12-06T01:23:08Z","2017-12-06T21:01:14Z"

But just to make sure it is no issue on Android, I'd like to report it. So, if this works fine on Android, it is fine with me. Better safe than sorry.  When I update a contact name in my contacts, the name is not updated in Signal. It looks like it only reads the name in the initial install or when a contact starts using Signal and not afterwards.   ### Steps to reproduce 1. Edit contacts in the native device ""contacts app"" 2. Check contacts in Signal where nothing is changed 3. Tap on the pen to open contacts in Signal 4. Swipe down to refresh/update contacts 5. Nothing changed 6. Delete conversation, repeat step 3 and 4 and get result of step 5  **Actual result:** Nothing happens in relation to the contact name **Expected result:** Name of contact updated to the contact in the address book/contacts.  ### Device info  **Device:** Blackberry Q10 SR10.3.3.1463 **Android version:** Android Runtime with [Android Jelly Bean support](https://developer.blackberry.com/android/apisupport/unsupported_api_jellybean_appfeatures.html)  **Signal version:** 3.3.0 to 4.6.1 (all versions I ran so far)  ### Link to debug log  Not Applicable I guess, but if it is useful I'd like to read the preferred actions. When looking at the debug log the only relevant thing I see after step 4 is:  ``` W/PushServiceSocket(593825851): Push service URL: https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org W/PushServiceSocket(593825851): Opening URL: https://textsecure-service.whispersystems.org/v1/directory/tokens W/Directory(593825851): Adding active token: +*********--, --------------, video: true ``` The dashes are the replacement of the last two digits and the secure string. So it does refresh but does not look at the my address book. There are no errors are shown either, so that made me think if it was just the absence of the functionality.","closed","","Recte","2017-06-01T07:26:22Z","2018-04-03T02:37:03Z"

Instead it displays numbers and all in gray.

But that's not what was originally intended. This block exists for a reason, I assume. So it seems the thumbnail generation finishes at a time that the video message is still displayed in preflight mode and slides are not reloaded in preflight mode. However we could make it reload, if the slide changed.  ### Steps to reproduce - attach a video somehow (sharing from outside, forwarding inside etc.) - hit send - wait for end of upload  **Actual result:** thumbnail placeholder is shown with play overlay (suspicious, overlay should only appear with the thumbnail, not the placeholder).

After closing the conversation and opening again the gif animated properly. This seems to be repeatable, so every 2nd time I open the conversation the gif doesn't animate. As a test I've send a second gif, now that conversation has 2 gifs, gif A and gif B. Now the behavior seems even more strange. On opening the conversation gif A animates, gif B doesn't. After closing and re-opening the conversation now gif A doesn't animate and gif B does animate. After every close and open sequence the correct animation switches between A and B. This behavior seems to happen in both version 4.13 and 4.14. Unable to verify older versions.  edit: The behavior with 2 gifs only seem to happen for some time after sending the second gif. After not using the phone for a while I opened the conversation with the 2 gifs and now it behaves similar as the one gif description. So either both animate correctly or none does.   ### Steps to reproduce - Open a conversation with a gif (either a send gif or a received one) - close the conversation and re-open and check animation of gif - repeat close/open conversation and check animation of gif  **Actual result:** Animated gif doesn't actually animate every 2nd time on opening a conversation. **Expected result:** Gif should animate every time a conversation is opened.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung SM-G900F **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.14.2  ### Link to debug log  This debug log contains opening and closing a conversation with 2 gifs multiple times. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d836c32fbdb2453395f2532fe4a12c2e","closed","","bme13","2017-12-07T12:21:20Z","2018-04-03T04:48:20Z"

While reproducing the issue to produce a log, it seems it has worsened, and now Signal crashes on launch, rendering it completely unusable.

SIM2 is the secondary SIM without data connection. _In my case, Signal was registered using the number of SIM2. However, sending/receiving encrypted messages via SIM1 only works flawlessly, thanks!_  - open existing conversation of a contact which does not use Signal (yet)   - this contact does only know my SIM2 number and thus, the whole conversation so far was written to and sent by my SIM2 - send an un-encrypted text message without manually switching the send-button to SIM2; SIM1 is always selected and used by default  **Actual result:**   - the contact gets my message from my SIM1 phone number which she did not recognize - my text message gets misinterpreted as spam which results in a failed conversation  **Expected result:**   - my text message gets sent via SIM2 (as before) and my contact recognizes my number  IMHO, this can be accomplished in two ways:  1. Signal asks me once (per un-encrypted conversation) which SIM I want to use for this contact     - This can be modified in the conversation settings 2. Signal analyses the conversation so far and if (a) every or (b) the most recent ones or (c) the previous message was sent from SIM2, use SIM2 as long as I manually don't switch the SIM for this conversation.  I'd go with 2. (c) because it seems to be the most intuitive solution without additional UI elements for switching default SIM in the conversation settings.  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.9.9","closed","","novoid","2017-09-22T16:29:02Z","2017-11-04T10:39:05Z"

I compared the list (while adding contacts to an existing group) with the list when using to send a Signal message. My observation is:  List (when adding contacts to a group):  * A * B * ... * Z  List (when sending to someone)  * A AnameWithA * B BnameWithB * ...

"","6702","Feature: Auto-Expiring Groups","I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  ## Summary  In similar vein to the ""disappearing message"" setting in Signal for set deletion of messages after a given time, I request a ""disappearing group"" setting. Such a setting would cause all members to leave a group a set period of time after the group's creation or after the most recent message and remove the group. This has at least one potential advantage / use case:  _Automated reduction of attack-surface for recovery of communications metadata_. Even if the auto-expiring messages feature is enabled, the discussion group's existence potentially remains on devices of involved parties. Compromise of any device involved in the conversation could reveal at least the contact information for people involved in the group, even if no actual communication information is risked.  ## Relevant Issues / Feature Requests Previously Opened  I did search the issues to try and ensure similar requests were not already considered. I did find a couple items, that are related but not the same:  * #1764 ""Enable sender to delete own messages from all parties in the conversation"". I agree that this was rightfully declined for the reasons mentioned in the thread. My feature request is not to create a single-user ability to remove a group from many devices, but to enable an feature analogous to ""disappearing messages"" that the entire group would see and be able to re-negotiate.  * #2412 'Is there a way to create an ""incognito thread""?' This discusses automated log-cleaning of individual conversations. It was declined according to discussion #1764 regarding deletion of messages from remote parties. I would argue my feature request is more akin to the ""disappearing messages"" feature, but extended to groups to further protect group membership from after-the-fact discovery by 3rd parties.","closed","","privong","2017-06-03T19:11:52Z","2018-04-03T02:36:51Z"

Due to technologic development in the last decades it got possible to communicate *wherever* the communication partners are and do it *whenever* they want to communicate asynchronously (in some forms this concepts were already present in the past by e.g. writing a letter). But in the digital age this whereever, whenever communication is heavily used and thus is optimized by integrating components that are natural in a face-to-face communication (which is due to evoluation development of humans the natural way ).   **One such very important integration were smilies/emoticons** which integrate the communication of mood/sentiment/feeling on the level of text based communication. Look how heavily these are used today! How many emoticons/smilies *did you* use the last 3 days, hmm? That was innovation for text based messaging and they got *indispensable for today text communication*. **Now are you ready for the next innovation??** (I hope you can't wait for it *drum roll please*):   *Important messages.* I know, I know at the first view this look really boring, but just think about it. When we talk face-to-face we can communicate emotions. By async text messaging we integrated that by introducing emotions/smilies. When we talk face-to-face we can just switch and talk in the present moment about, what is most important to us. By **async messaging we can not do that .... yet**. The ""problem"" with async messaging is, that we always have a form of mailbox where many messages await us. But what if we don't have time to see all messages? We just want to read the most important messages, but what is important, we can only determine after reading. The contact partner himself has no way to show, that one message is really important (in the face-to-face communication he could just simply speak about the important thing, **but in async communication this competes with his earlier communication**).  So, just one **question for you**: Did you ever have the problem, that someone had open messages from you and you couldn't communicate important messages (and calling would be inappropriate)?   One of many examples would be, that you want to remind someone of a credit transfer which should be done on the next day (or a meeting, or [...]). You don't want to interrupt your communication partner by calling him (busy person) and just want that when he looks the next time on the phone (in some short free period) he sees and looks at the important message (wihout needing to read and answer to an discussion about another topic you had earlier).  I belief that this feature would have quite an impact, especially for persons who don't always read all messages right away. A question about a cinema visit today eventing would be read in time. Important messages:  Like emoticons **at first inconspicuous but later indispensable**.  What do you think? :)  # Realisation example On the sender: Equip the context menu of the ""send button"" with a third element (additionally to unsecure sms and signal), called e.g. ""Signal - urgent"" or something. After writing and sending such a message, signal would switch automatically back in the normal mode.  On the reciever: He gets the special message with a special notification (e.g. the notification get's a slightly red color and the important messages get a red icon) .  What do you think? :)","closed","","DoS007","2017-07-11T17:08:55Z","2018-04-03T03:40:24Z"
"","6928","Messages w/attachment sent on desktop disappear from mobile","I have: - [X] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  - Issue copied over from [Closed Desktop issue 1424](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop/issues/1424) as requested by @scottnonnenberg  ### Bug description  Under the following conditions, messages disappear in an untimely fashion from Signal Android:  1. The message is sent from Signal Desktop (Electron); and 2. The message has an attachment or is a voice message; and 3. The message is sent in a conversation that has the ""Disappearing Messages"" feature turned on  ### Steps to reproduce - Have Signal Android and Signal Desktop (Electron) linked - Enter a conversation on Signal Desktop - Turn on ""Disappearing Messages"" if not already on (set the time to 1 day) - Send a message with an attachment - or - send a voice message - Wait for the message to be sent successfully, reach the recipient successfully (two ""tick marks"") - Watch the same conversation on Signal Android  **Actual result:**  - The messages are synchronised to Signal Android - After around 1-2 minutes, the messages with the attachments disappear from Signal Android  - Unreproducible: Sometimes the message doesn't show up at all on Signal Android. This happened to me yesterday pretty consistently with voice messages but I can't reproduce that today. I suspect that they might show up and disappear too fast for me to see. Today they behave like other messages with attachments.  (the messages do not disappear from Signal Desktop nor do they disappear from the recipient's device)  **Expected result:**  - The messages are synchronised to Signal Android and stay there for the duration specified in the ""Disappearing messages"" menu - The messages disappear simultaneously from both Signal Desktop and Signal Android when the period specified for ""Disappearing messages"" has elapsed.  ### Screenshots  Desktop: ![signal-desktop-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1229613/29997387-eaba116e-9011-11e7-9059-c7906d3baf0a.png) ![signal-desktop-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1229613/29997388-eef386d4-9011-11e7-8ea2-bf2e8a802c28.png)   Mobile: ![signal-android-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1229613/29997368-8ab10520-9011-11e7-9a46-58f2e039c86d.png) ![signal-android-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1229613/29997370-8fd6efe2-9011-11e7-944f-ca593560d310.png)  ### Platform info  **Operating System**: Ubuntu GNU/Linux 16.04.3 LTS (xaniel) x86_64 **Browser**: N/A (Electron) **Signal version:** signal-desktop 1.0.22       amd64  **Operating System**: Android 7.1.2, LineageOS version 14.1-20170824-NIGHTLY-oneplus2 **Device**: Oneplus 2 **Signal version:** Signal 4.9.9  ### Link to debug log  [Signal Desktop](https://gist.github.com/80b6257811b7775b8e04c00ebe9fce1b) [Signal Android](https://gist.github.com/e5caede11b46aebe281adfa98e2316d8)","closed","","arikb","2017-09-06T22:25:56Z","2017-10-31T18:08:59Z"

This would allow swiping up or down instead of using a back button (in navigation or action bar) for closing the activity. You can see this feature in action with the official Twitter app when you view an image in fullscreen. (EDIT 2017-10-04: WhatsApp's media preview also supports this in the most recent stable Android release)  I see the following advantages in this feature:  - If we decide to hide action bar and navigation bar in the future (#5934), this feature will allow the user to go back without bringing the bars onscreen before. - When using a touch screen, the middle of the screen should be the easiest accessible region for touch actions. With this feature we don't have to move our finger to the corner of the display to leave the activity.  This feature was first proposed in a [community forum thread](https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/support-android-drag-dismiss-activity/896).  This [extended FrameLayout](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/ui/widget/ElasticDragDismissFrameLayout.java) could be useful for implementing this feature.","closed","feature,","FeuRenard","2017-05-10T13:24:55Z","2018-04-16T18:37:00Z"

Even deleting the draft doesn't delete the file.  **Actual result:**  - A file with a `jpg` extension is created in the folder `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/org.thoughcrime.securesms/files` - the file name is made of the digits of what appears to be `ctime` of the time the file was created. - The file persists throughout the life of the app and never deleted, even when the image in the conversation is deleted or the entire conversation is deleted. - Clearing Signal's storage from the app info applet does delete all files in that folder.  **Expected result:**  - Ideally, No plaintext image file would be created anywhere within the phone's file system - Alternatively, the file will be deleted as soon as practicable after it has been encrypted and stored in Signal's database  ### Device info **Device:** Tested on OnePlus 2 and Samsung Galaxy S7 **Android version:** Tested under OxygenOS Stock 3.6.0 for Oneplus 2 and Cyanogen 14.1 NIGHTLY for S7 **Signal version:** 4.9.9 and, based on the pictures left on my device, multiple previous versions","closed","","arikb","2017-08-29T22:45:43Z","2017-11-03T17:54:35Z"

Here's the stack trace and a couple lines before it for context:  ``` 08-01 13:02:50.094  4752  7122 I ActivityManager: Start proc 11609:org.thoughtcrime.securesms/u0a105 for activity org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity 08-01 13:02:50.211 11609 11609 I MultiDex: VM with version 2.1.0 has multidex support 08-01 13:02:50.212 11609 11609 I MultiDex: install 08-01 13:02:50.212 11609 11609 I MultiDex: VM has multidex support, MultiDex support library is disabled. 08-01 13:02:50.215 11609 11609 W PartProvider: onCreate() 08-01 13:02:50.261 11609 11609 W PersistentAlarmManagerListener: class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.service.RotateSignedPreKeyListener scheduling for: 1501615220840 08-01 13:02:50.266 11609 11609 W PersistentAlarmManagerListener: class org.thoughtcrime.securesms.service.DirectoryRefreshListener scheduling for: 1501620162997 08-01 13:02:50.314 11609 11609 D JVM     : JVM::Initialize@[tid=11609] 08-01 13:02:50.314 11609 11609 D JVM     : JVM::JVM@[tid=11609] 08-01 13:02:50.315 11609 11609 D JVM     : LoadClasses 08-01 13:02:50.315 11609 11609 D JVM     : name: org/webrtc/voiceengine/BuildInfo 08-01 13:02:50.315 11609 11609 D JVM     : name: org/webrtc/voiceengine/WebRtcAudioManager 08-01 13:02:50.315 11609 11609 D JVM     : name: org/webrtc/voiceengine/WebRtcAudioRecord 08-01 13:02:50.315 11609 11609 D JVM     : name: org/webrtc/voiceengine/WebRtcAudioTrack 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: JobConsumer-4 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 11609 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: Theme: themes:{default=overlay:system, iconPack:system, fontPkg:system, com.android.systemui=overlay:system, com.android.systemui.navbar=overlay:system} 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.AssertionError: Not e164: HQ-spotthestation@mail.nasa.gov 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.Address.toPhoneString(Address.java:112) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientProvider.getIndividualRecipientDetails(RecipientProvider.java:136) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientProvider.getRecipientDetailsSync(RecipientProvider.java:130) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientProvider.getRecipient(RecipientProvider.java:83) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientProvider.getRecipients(RecipientProvider.java:99) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.RecipientFactory.getRecipientsFor(RecipientFactory.java:53) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MmsReceiveJob.isBlocked(MmsReceiveJob.java:89) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.MmsReceiveJob.onRun(MmsReceiveJob.java:60) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.runJob(JobConsumer.java:76) 08-01 13:02:50.349 11609 11628 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.whispersystems.jobqueue.JobConsumer.run(JobConsumer.java:46) 08-01 13:02:50.351  4752  4837 W ActivityManager:   Force finishing activity org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity ```  There are actually more Signal-related logs below, but I'm guessing this is all you need - let me know if that's not the case and I can post the other ones too.

Not that awesome when you sit in public transport and suddenly your music drops to the phone speakers at max volume.  ### Steps to reproduce - Play music on bluetooth headset - Receive a call  **Actual result:** Music is offloaded to speakers **Expected result:** Music should pause as it does on phone or hangout calls (for those two i know that it works correctly)  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus 3T **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.2.5 **Headphones** Parrot Zik **Music player** Poweramp  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/88ba0c6e3490d603f6638846c7e4272f","closed","","sulaweyo","2017-04-20T18:05:37Z","2018-04-03T02:32:25Z"

I don't really have particular steps to repro this with, but it _seems_ to happen if I'm chatting with a signal user and during that, another contact I've invited to use signal installs it and messages me.  ### Steps to reproduce see above  **Actual result:** Signal contacts appearing as non-signal contacts sometimes in-conversation with them **Expected result:** Signal contacts always show as signal contacts in-conversation unless they've uninstalled the app, etc.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S8 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.10.12  ### Link to debug log","closed","","jeremymasters","2017-09-28T20:15:58Z","2017-10-23T20:04:27Z"

This seems to be an intermittent problem. This is a regression from 4.7.4 where it was working fine.   ### Steps to reproduce 1) Open the app 2) Put it into to background, let the phone go to sleep or bring another app into the foreground  **Actual result:** New Message notification are often not triggered till I bring Signal to the foreground. **Expected result:** New message notification should occur even when in the background.  ### Device info  Device  : OnePlus ONEPLUS A3000 (OnePlus3) Android : 6.0.1 (118, ONEPLUS A3000_28_161213) Signal Version: 4.8.1  ### Link to debug log Debug log captures this.

Current sounds (sonar sound and ping when call is established/terminated) are by my opinion too aggressive. They contain too much high tones.  My proposal is, to use more soft sounds.  My proposal is also to replace sonar sound with something more similar to ringing... for instance instead of sonar there should be ""slow"" ringing and when ringing starts, there should be regular ringing (as it is now).  Another proposal is also to measure bandwidth and quality of call. When quality of call starts to get to low, user should get a very soft beep-beep-beep sound, so he/she is alerted there are problems with bandwidth. This should also be visible on the screen.  If connection drops (because of bad connection), it should be re-establisher automatically - user should be alerted of this re-establishing by sound and by screen text.  Anyway, I am also noticing some problems with bandwidth consumption. Are there any plans that when bad network conditions occur, codec automatically ""switches"" to lower quality? I am not talking about VBR codecs, just that maybe there should be two codecs used - one for normal bandwidth and another when bandwidth is lower.","closed","","MatejKovacic","2017-04-26T20:46:10Z","2017-04-26T23:33:44Z"

Once that message has been sent, set the _disappearing messages_ timer, which will automatically delete subsequent messages (excluding the _anchor_).  It is unknown if this will serve to anchor the group with recipients, especially if they manually delete the _anchor_.  - Assuming you're using the desktop client, where the group will not disappear once the timer has expired (but messages will), send a message to the group.  This will serve to recreate the group on the mobile app.  The group will disappear on the mobile app should the timer expire again.  ### App State - Signal messages and calls registered  - SMS/MMS Enabled  - Notifications on  - Passphrase on, Screen security on  - Theme Dark, Language Default  - Message trimming off  - 3rd party app info unknown, other than being Signal registered  ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei Nexus 6P **Android version:** 7.1.2, build N2G47H **Signal version:** 4.4.0 _beta_  ### Link to debug log Bug(?) was not noticed in a timely fashion, so no debug log was generated.","closed","","AboveMyPaygrade","2017-04-24T16:03:38Z","2017-04-25T17:19:08Z"

I am also using Biocoded app, which is using Signal protocol, and it is working without any problems. So I assume it is not mobile network problem...  Anyway, I remember there were some problems with Signal servers a few months ago, and after Moxie resolved them, Signal calls started working. Maybe there is similar problem?  ### Steps to reproduce - start Signal call - after some time connection is not possible anymore or right now: - start Signal call - just pulse sound is heard  **Actual result:** The other party cannot hear me or the call is not established at all. **Expected result:** Call should work.  ### Device info **Device:** LG Nexus 5 **Android version:** CM13 **Signal version:** 4.3.2  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/f793698a73ccc839818fffd1b42bc97b","closed","","MatejKovacic","2017-04-24T18:13:35Z","2018-04-03T02:32:02Z"

Actually it is not a bug, but for me it is not enough, Signal Protocol is probably the best end to end encryption, but who cares about it, if someone could log in as a second device or else. There should be a better logging situation. I would suggest a small thing, that would change a lot. The security code, which is send over SMS or Call should be just shown in the App. If Alice adds her second smartphone, the verification number should be send inside the signal app. That could give the user a better feeling of authentication and prevents also eavesdropper (like ss7 hacks etc.). But if we wanna go further, signal developer should implement two-step verification.

"","7140","[Feature Request] Signed Encrypted Backup Signal Apk","I have an idea to overcome the lack of the encrypted backup functionality.  Problem: The problem with encrypted backups is that you can only do them if you compile your own instance of signal (which can not be installed over an existing installation and can not be easily updated). An encrypted backup of an existing official signal installation is not possible. (but necessary) The titanium backup way requires rooted phones, which is not feasable every time. Since this issue has been open for years now, without a (usable) sollution, i propose a simple workaround that does not cost many ressources.  Suggested Feature: The signal developers that hold the key used to sign the official apks could provide a version where encryted backups are enabled. This version could be installed over the existing signal installation on non rooted phones and would finally enable users to migrate signal to a new phone. (without root obviously)  Expected outcome: No more whining about missing functionality. Development of a ""clean"" sollution can go on without stress.  Footnote: Maybe hide the apk download a bit and mark ist as unstable so people wont complain if it does not work in their case.","closed","","username11236","2017-10-30T14:13:18Z","2018-04-10T12:32:01Z"

It doesn't look good and confuses the user. If this is supposed to help the user understand what should be put into the field, please use `android:hint` instead.  - If during registration internet connection is lost, even if only for a few seconds, registration is aborted (understandably), but the app prompts you to start again by editing your phone number. There is no need to adjust the phone number, as at this step the phone number has already been confirmed, the confirmation code was received, the only thing that's missing now is to register online. A simple ""retry"" button would be nice, as there is no reason to re-confirm the phone number by re-receiving the confirmation code.

I'm trying this with 3.31.1, and it's happening both on an emulated Nexus 5X (API 24, no gapps) and on a physical Nexus 6 with stock Android 7.1.1 (with gapps). The only difference is that the app on the emulator crashes immediately, while on the physical device can see (for a second or so) the calling screen. Here is the debug log of the crash from Android Studio for the emulated device:  ``` 03-10 11:11:58.132 3362-7710/org.thoughtcrime.securesms I/org.webrtc.Logging: PeerConnectionFactory:

Start video from message list, and entire video plays without the screen shutting off. 15 seconds after the video completes, the screen shuts off. 2. Pause video and screen shuts off after 15 seconds.  3. Pause video and seek, then screen shuts off after 15 seconds.   I'd also like some feedback on a couple things: 1.

"","6559","Play services issue","First of all, I've never come across another app that won't allow the user to bypass the ""update play services"" popup by clicking outside the popup, and then work as normal, if indeed the app doesn't REQUIRE play services (but still attempts to use it for something). Signal registration fails completely if play services isn't the latest possible version, even if the user has it disabled. You should allow the user to click outside that popup and proceed without updating/using play services if in fact Signal works without it. That's what most apps do if they don't require play services.  Second, your comment about Signal being designed to work if play services isn't installed on the device at all is completely facetious. ALL android devices have this installed. The only way to get it completely deleted is to root the device, which thanks to google, can only be done by using third-party apps like Kingroot which is made by unknown people in China and introduces a huge security risk. Therefore, it's only feasible to DISABLE play services, google services framework, the play store, and google account manager.  Third, you ask what is the benefit of making play services disabled ""if it is some kind of malware."" Well, (1) play services constantly phones home to a google domain at 1e100.net. It has complete permissions to your device and, knowing how google is, most likely uploads the user's contacts and files, and may even record audio and video without the user knowing. The mere fact that it has permission to do all of that is a security risk in itself (and opens a backdoor for the government to collude with google to develop spy tools for Android phones). (2) Play services is constantly updating, which I have found can cause major incompatibility issues and brick phones, since google doesn't test the update on every phone in use in the marketplace. Google forces the updates on users, which is unethical and unnecessary if the old version is working.  So, hopefully you can see why play services is a major problem. Basically, google treats peoples' phones as if it belonged to google, controlling what can run on the device, forcing updates, accessing god knows what, and constantly phoning home, as any user with a firewall app can see. They act as if they are only ""licensing"" the phone to the user, rather than the user actually owning the phone and controlling it. Honestly, I would think any developer working on a privacy/security product like Signal would have grasped this already.

I see the message popup indicating I've gotten a new message, and about 80% of the time when I click the popup, my chrome instance is highlighted, but the signal instance does not appear.    I've enabled, disabled, removed, re-added, re re re,moved , re re added etc a number of times with no change in behavior.   Once I have the window open and working, it will continue to work as long as I do not close the window. once I close the window, it's anyone's guess whether it will come back again.   Sometimes I have the signal icon showing in the control panel open programs list, where I have attempted to bookmark the signal icon so it is easily accessible: If I hover over the icon and I can see the program preview, signal will work as expected. If the icon will not show up, or hovering does not show the program  preview, there is literally nothing I can do to convince the window for signal to show itself. It is obviously running, because I still get the message alerts- but the actual message window can not be accessed.   I attempted to go to the extension, and use the ""create shortcut"" option from the extension window. This will very occasionally work, but it's rare. the shortcut mainly gives me a ""working"" icon, and then does nothing.     I can also go to the ""view in store"" and select ""launch app"" from the chrome store. Again, occasionally this will work, but almost never. mostly it just does nothing.   I have been paying attention, but I can not find any  consistency for when it will work vs when it will not work. It does not seem more likely to work after a reboot or before, And I believe it has randomly started to work in the middle of a browser session (though I'm not 100% sure).  The only thing that Has changed about my configuration is the OS version, so I'm sure there is something environmental causing this- but I have not been able to narrow down what triggers the behavior.   One more interesting thing I just discovered: It's more likely to work if I use one chorme profile than another.  when it fails to work, it always highlights the  shortcut to the chrome profile that works less often.  The extension shows as installed on both.     Perhaps this is a strange side effect of windows 10 + profiles in chrome?","closed","","amazingandrogen","2017-03-08T16:48:10Z","2017-03-13T18:30:45Z"

Device A scans Device B's QR code, checks the number, marks it as ""verified"" and sends an acknowledgement message to device B, authenticated by the temporary password; 1.

"","6613","[UX] Passphrase-protect and hide only ""sensitive"" contacts.","As part of an intermediate threat level(?) model, I'd like to have - like in GO SMS Pro, for example - the passphrase-protection apply only to a subset of my contacts/conversations, which should not affect normal usage of the app for the rest of the conversations in any way. The ""sensitive"" conversations should only show up and be available to interact with when the passphrase is entered.  For this to happen, of course, there needs to be an entirely different handling of the passphrase-protection (or just a new dedicated contacts-hiding passphrase mechanism?) where it doesn't auto-lock the whole app but only some conversations. In this case I should have something like an Unlock option in the Settings menu rather than as the first thing shown on app launch.  The scenario I'm thinking of is probably a quite common one, where you expect to forget your phone on a table somewhere and to have people looking through it while you're gone. In that case it's not much of a problem if they can get past the lockscreen but it becomes more important that a few apps or app sections holding sensitive information be really locked down with something more complicated than what's typically available as a screen locker. (If I complicate the screen locker by making it a long PIN or passphrase I severely reduce the usability of my phone, and in my opinion it's the same with my SMS handling app, which should be able to deal with ""inocuous"" conversations quickly and easily even if I have other conversations that I want to keep under a tighter lock.)  As for new message notifications from the hidden contacts, they should have some generic new-message text that doesn't disclose either the contact's name or the contents of what they've sent you.","closed","","donjoe0","2017-05-04T21:29:12Z","2017-05-23T09:45:57Z"

After a fair bit of hunting, I managed to find that phone numbers are being synced periodically, [after SHA1-ing their e164 value](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libsignal-service-java/blob/a722aef284e2ce08bfc63f4e15be3fbaa44e4651/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/SignalServiceAccountManager.java#L296) (well, 10 digits of it).  Given that [SHA1 hashing tends to be measured in _millions per second_](http://thepasswordproject.com/oclhashcat_benchmarking), and phone numbers are a rather small search space, this is effectively giving all your phone numbers to the server.  Reversing these hashes is, while not giving guaranteed results (given only 10 chars), trivial and still gives very high confidence in the results.  Not that I believe you're doing so, but for future-proofing this appears to be a pretty big leak if someone gains control of the Signal servers.  I was legitimately shocked that I couldn't find a way to disable this sync, either in the app or code.  Since it seems this could be done lazily (only check for the single contact you're trying to message, on first attempt) and the tradeoff is that you would only lose known-users (until checked) when browsing all your contacts, it seems like it'd be a good idea to allow people to disable this for a bit better protection.

Please see the referenced pull request for a detailed description of the problem and most of the proposed solution.  As far as this pull request is concerned, a periodic alarm is set up, to ""prod"" and awaken the pipe, which, in the absence of GCM, will generally be trapped in blocking wait.  The period is set to 60s, because that's the smallest period allowed by `AlarmManager`.  As a result the keep-alive period on the socket's side had to be increased to match.  Note that in the proposed solution:  *) Allowance is made for the co-existence of more than one pipes, or, at least more than one `MessageRetrievalThread`s, which, as far as I could determine, can be the case.  *) Prods are only enabled in the absence of GCM.  If it is deemed, that they would be beneficial on GCM-enabled devices as well (see the relevant discussion in WhisperSystems/libsignal-service-java#45), this can trivially be accommodated, by unconditionally creating and registering the alarm receiver.","closed","","dpapavas","2017-10-15T22:11:14Z","2017-10-16T08:33:30Z"

Every time something needs to be saved on the sdcard, we see some `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()` calls and checks for errors. I believe this belongs to utils, both for clarity and for centralizing the access to the file storage. Moreover, this refactoring is supposed to help for issues #2791 and #5364.  I believe that more refactoring should be done on the `SaveAttachmentTask` in order to make it testable: I would move the decryption logic out of it and make it get directly an `InputStream`, so that instrumented tests could try to write attachments on the sdcard without taking care of the encryption.","closed","","JonasVautherin","2017-04-02T15:10:20Z","2017-07-11T11:18:40Z"

I had to change one minor line in the `build.gradle`, but that has no consequences on the code itself. * __Notes:__ The travis configuration required a few tricks (the build was crashing because of memory issues, for instance, so the javaMaxHeapSize had to be decreased and the simulator had to be started after the build, ...).

Even so the linking process worked pretty fine, it turned out that all the other functionality in Signal-on-Android-x86 isn't working at all (like sending text messages or esp. **calling other signal users**). That is probably because Android-x86 (in a Virtualbox) uses the LAN interface (NIC) (to connect to the internet) and it seems like the Signal-Android-app expects a WiFi connection instead of a LAN connection.

This makes it hard to share a message with a group, especially if it has an attachment.  ### Steps to reproduce - Make sure some conversations and groups exist - Select a message and try to forward it to a group.  **Actual result:** Groups only appear in the following lists under ""recent conversations"". This means, if the group does has no recent messages, it cannot be selected here. Also, the search functionality does not find groups in this activity.  **Expected result:** I'd expect groups to appear in the contacts list as well and that they can be found by the search feature. Alternatively, an extra category ""groups"" could be introduced alongside ""recent conversations"" and ""contacts"".","closed","","merkste","2017-12-16T16:08:13Z","2017-12-16T18:27:48Z"

No draft is saved.  ### Steps to reproduce - Be using an app that's not Signal - Receive a message - Start typing a reply in the toast box - Receive another message (in my case from the same sender, I'm not positive a different sender will cause this)  **Actual result:** The 2nd message's toast pops up over the first one, and the message being entered into the first toast disappears. **Expected result:** Preferably the 2nd message would be queued (or perhaps extend the toast vertically, if that's an option?), or at least a draft would be saved.

"","7158","Easy mixup of personal and group conversations: Change the styling of a group conversation","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates  ----------------------------------------  ### Underlying usability issue  There is a common **usability bug** of Signal. Lets say you are getting a Signal message on your mobile. You select the notification message, switching to your Signal app, opening the conversation. You now see the last part of the conversation dialogue between you and this single person. You now answer the message of that person, writing things that are meant to be read only by that single person. Just after sending the message (or never?) you realize that you just sent this message to a group chat of many people whose conversation happens to be filled with messages of you and the other person  as long as your screen view/history is showing.   Therefore, you **accidentally sent a personal message to a group conversation**.  You _assumed_, that you wrote your message in a private conversation because you have seen only one person's answers. Other people did not write for a longer period of time to that group conversation. You could have read the header information where you could have seen that this is not a person-to-person conversation. However, you concentrate on the bottom of the screen, where the received message could be seen and answer right below it. Therefore, it is easy to overlook the group chat header when answering a message in Signal. There is no other distinction between group and personal conversations.  The ability to change/overwrite the background color of group chats to an alarming red one for example could give the user a hint that this is not a personal conversation but a group chat. However, there is still the issue that Signal might give away ""red"" for an arbitrary personal conversation but this only leads to you looking more closely to the header, realizing that it is save to write personal stuff in this conversation.  _There might be other solutions to this usability issue_ (all group chats look different that any other given person-to-person conversation somehow) but my proposed feature here is a quickfix that might work for many users.  ### Proposed Quickfix  I would like to be able to **set (or overwrite) the background color of a group conversation** just like it is possible for person-to-person conversations.  ### Steps to reproduce - switch to a person-to-person conversation - hamburger menu > ""Conversation settings"" - ""Color"" may be changed/overwritten - switch to a group conversation - hamburger menu > ""Conversation settings"" - no ""Color"" option is shown  **Expected result:** I want to have the ""Color"" option for group conversations as well.  ### Device info  **Device**: OnePlus 5 **iOS version**: Android 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.11.5","closed","ux,","novoid","2017-11-04T10:34:54Z","2018-04-03T04:41:59Z"
"","6905","Texts not delivered to users who get new phones and don't reinstall Signal","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Scenario: Someone is using Signal, then switches to a new phone but doesn’t reinstall/re-set up Signal.  Issue: I send them a text message through Signal. The lock symbol appears (so the message is being routed through Signal), the first checkmark (the message was sent) appears, but I never get the second checkmark (the message was delivered).  I've run into this issue with at least 3 people in the last week. In addition to the problem itself, it is additionally problematic that there is no notification the message was never delivered. I only discover it when I go to text that person again days, or weeks later - and even then it often takes me a few more instances before I notice what's going on.   ### Steps to reproduce - Set up Signal on a phone. - Drop phone in toilet. - Get a new phone, don't set up Signal. - Have someone else send you a text message.   **Actual result:**  - The recipient does not receive any message. - The sender does not receive a notification their message failed to deliver.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) - The text message would be routed to the recipient's normal text message app, OR... - The sender would be notified the text message could not be delivered.  ### Platform info  **Operating System**: LG G6, Android 7.0. **Signal version:** 4.9.9","closed","","zacharycohn","2017-08-28T18:20:09Z","2019-03-05T00:16:01Z"

To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal://  I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.)  Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible.  `Send message to Signal Private Messenger`  Read more about this [here](https://www.themarketingtechnologist.co/open-a-whatsapp-conversation-directly-from-your-ad/)","closed","feature,","Meteor0id","2017-12-31T22:27:29Z","2018-04-03T04:57:27Z"

I've tested this on my device. I see the new option in the dialog that appears when you tap on the banner, and I can select the never ask again button and make the banner disappear. Going back to the chat, the banner is still gone. So I'm fairly certain this solves the issue.  I only have the string for English, because I only speak English.  (I had trouble testing it, because my build isn't signed with the key used for the Play Store and I couldn't install it over the existing Signal to use its database. I couldn't get the bar on any group chats I made, and eventually I had to resort to asking all my Facebook friends to Signal group chat me. I've also clobbered my Signal keys about 3 times today. I wish there was some kind of testing guide.)","closed","","interfect","2017-10-05T03:40:23Z","2017-10-31T18:15:56Z"

Fixes #7255 (though _improves the situation_ is perhaps more accurate).  This is what the expanded notification drawer _used_ to look like (sensitive data removed): ![screenshot_20171207-232236](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3037552/33751300-045ed41a-dba8-11e7-8eb1-4998c09aee97.png)  Note how this results in _two_ Signal-icon notifications in the status bar when a message notification is also present: ![33751284-dc1cc318-dba7-11e7-9193-91216ddc5194](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3037552/33974893-101b76e0-e059-11e7-9802-3ca05f35f668.png)  This pull request changes the background connection icon to `ic_settings_input_antenna_black_24dp` (part of the Material icon set), making the message notification icon different from that of the background connection notification, so that the two can be easily differentiated: ![screenshot_1513222627](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3037552/33974926-3c4b86f6-e059-11e7-9c3e-57a36fbb4de7.png)  This change affects only a small number of users (i.e. users whose phones run Android without Google Play Services), and is only particularly relevant to users of Android >= 8.1 (the background connection notification does not appear in the status bar in lower versions).  This contribution comes out of a desire to fix something that has been nagging at me ever since I updated to Android 8.1, and I imagine that I'm not the only user who is bothered by the confusing background connection icon. (It looks like I _always_ have a notification.)  This is my first contribution to the Signal codebase. I'm happy to change the icon if the chosen one seems inappropriate. (I spent awhile combing through the Material icon set and this one seemed ideal, though beauty is in the eye of the beholder!)  The license of the Material icon (Apache 2.0) is compatible with GPLv3, so licensing should not be an issue.

So the single-tap that usually shows/hides the playback controls now also shows/hides the action bar, too. Additionally I colored the action bar semi-transparent.  I tested this contribution for both image views and for both video views.

This PR makes sure that `insertListener.onComplete()` is called before `notifyConversationListeners(...)`. I see two possibilities to achieve this:  - Move `insertListener.onComplete()` to [`insertMediaMessage(...)`](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/MmsDatabase.java#L961). That's what I did. The only disadvantage I see, is changing the method signature of `insertMediaMessage(...)`, which is used in two other places. - Move or copy `notifyConversationListeners(...)` to [`insertMessageOutbox(...)`](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/MmsDatabase.java#L866). This method is used when sending a media message, sending a self message and receiving messages. So by moving this method call, we maybe miss to notify in some cases. Copying the method call will cause redundant notify calls. My intuition says, that this alternative is slightly more risky or error-prone.  I tested:  - sending messages in groups: no duplicates as described in #6677. - sending self messages: behaviour seems unchanged - receiving messages while the according conversation is showing: behaviour seems unchanged  Fixes #6677","closed","","FeuRenard","2017-05-25T16:02:05Z","2017-06-02T20:39:28Z"

The following problems remain:  - Raise offscreen page limit of the viewPager to enable a smoother paging experience? By default the viewed page plus one page to the right and one to the left is instantiated (offscreen page limit = 1). If you use a slow phone and swipe swiftly, you will reach a page whose media are not yet instantiated. You will see a black page which will display media with some latency. We can try to solve this issue by raising the offscreen page limit to 2. In worst case you are still using a slow phone and 5 GIFs are now instantiated (animated). I observed that the animations get slow in this situation. This could be solved by stopping GIF animations when GIFs are offscreen. If you want this behaviour, I will implement it. - Do we want to be able to switch pages when an image is zoomed in? I implemented this feature in #5801, but decided to keep it out of this PR to keep the diff low. - On Android versions prior to Marshmallow no video thumbnails are created. In media preview when swiping to a video the placeholder will be shown. It has to be tapped to start video playback. To make this clear, we should show the play overlay above the placeholder. This should go in a separate PR, too. -> #6635 - The video thumbnails maybe should have the same size as the video and don't fill the whole screen.  Sadly I'm not able to test this contribution with the platforms that use the old video player, which are Android versions 4.0.1 downwards (see #6603). I would be happy, if someone tested this PR using such a device :)  Fixes #2355  Supersedes #5801","closed","","FeuRenard","2017-05-12T21:55:50Z","2018-03-16T21:49:31Z"

It can be really annoying as users may not even notice that part of message is not shown if the message is not cut half-sentence. I had this problem multiple times when my contact copied a longer text to me using Signal Desktop and I tried to read it on Android.  Resolving the issue properly probably requires a lot of work (like adding a way to display full message body or splitting large messages into smaller parts) and I believe it will take some time, especially considering that the issue mentioned is already over a year old. In the meantime I think it would be fair to inform users that part of message is not displayed so that they can resolve it with their contacts somehow (like using another communication channel or splitting the message manually).","closed","wontfix,","greenjoe","2017-05-30T22:28:30Z","2022-02-02T06:09:08Z"

Iterating through all messages is not a very fast solution, but still better than manual searching. That’s why only the loaded part of the conversation (500 messages by default) is searched, to get a fast feedback whether the information you’re looking for is in the conversation or not; if no match is found the user can decide to load the whole conversation and search again. If you don’t think that the user experience with this patch is good enough, I’m fine if you don’t want to merge this PR, but I considered this patch quite useful during the last month, so I wanted to share it.","closed","","gulp21","2017-09-10T20:59:23Z","2017-12-25T22:52:54Z"

The main problem here is that during de-registration all messages are sent/received.   **Expected result:** Not sure what I expect, but if Signal is blocked then messages shouldn't go through at all. So maybe it is a security issue, or perhaps there is another way to circumvent censorship?  ### Screenshots Sorry no screenshots as the explanation is self-sufficient (hopefully).   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.8.1  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/b53230b3764cb08ad97ff102088700db","closed","","OH-BUGGER","2017-08-24T22:38:17Z","2017-08-28T01:05:59Z"

Freezing the microg framework allows websockets to be used instead, as gsf is no longer detected.  I use the standalone apk release from the website, and would greatly appreciate it if an option to toggle the use of gcm could be exposed somewhere in the standalone apk releases. Alternatively, Signal could test to see if gcm is functional or not before registration and upon startup, and fall back to websockets with the standard notice in the event a system issue is present, or the user is opting to use websockets on purpose.  As an aside, if I unfreeze the microg framework now, will Signal continue using websockets instead?

This is especially easy to do if you use Signal continuously throughout the day and alternate between conversations. People who use Signal may be sharing very sensitive information. Misfires can be disastrous.   ### Feature request  Provide a user option that greys out or (better) disables every contact except the one being actively used.  Example of the need: A friend accidentally shared sensitive personal information with a reporter today, and he told her he had done the exact same thing earlier in the day. My friend did this when she moved from Signal IoS to Signal desktop, which had a different contact's window open than on IoS. Yes, she is an idiot, but there are a lot of idiots with sensitive information who are using Signal.  For many Signal users, this would be a very important feature. Finding ways to reduce user error makes Signal safer to use.  ### Device info  **Device:** Iphone 5c **IoS version:** 10.2.1 **Signal version:** 2.7.1  Desktop: MacBookAir OSX Sierra 10.12.3  Signal version: ""About Signal"" is greyed out","closed","","ailanthus8","2017-02-28T22:45:07Z","2018-04-03T02:10:17Z"

I am Jinsik, a manager of SK Telecom, a telecommunication company in South Korea.  Rececntly I found that your ""Signal Private Messenger(android)"" has a bug action.  When someone send a message to other's Signal App, the receiver's Signal App doesn't show the notification of receiving a new message. At that time, the receiver has to start  ""Signal Private Messenger"" manually for receiving the new messages.  So I tested my phone with Signal Private Messenger, and found the some points of improvement for pushing the notification from your push server.  < Testing Phone's Packet Analysis > 1. When the LTE device staying in the state of RRC_CONNECT,       the latency of the international network to your push server(2404:6800:4008:c06::bc)       is good between the handset and your phone.  ( RTT : about 100 msec )  2. But, while the LTE device' state changes from RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECT,    the latency to your push server(2404:6800:4008:c06::bc, port:5228)      is too big between the handset and your server as the attachment.( RTT : about 400~1000 msec )    And sometimes the TCP latency causes the TCP retransmission of push packets from your    push server to our phones.  < Check point > 1. Please check that the TCP latency including LTE device state's change may cause    the big network latency and TCP retransmission of push packets.    and it may cause the failure of immediate receiving the notification of a new message arrival.  2. For improving the success rate of receiving the new message notification,      Please consider that your app and push-sever extend the internal TCP or SOCKET timer for     tranporting  push packet and waiting ACK packet for the new message notifiction.        Best Regards, Jinsik  ### Steps to reproduce - install Signal Private Messenger into Android phone in South Korea - Send a new message to it. - Sometimes, app doesn't receive the new messages immediately. - At that time, after restarting app, it can receive the new message.   **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots  attachment file can show the international latency for push packets. and screenshot of app is no notificatino of receiving the new messages.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 **Android version:** 7.0.1 **Signal version:** 4. 11. 5  ### Link to debug log   Sometimes, app doesn't receive the new messages immediately.  At that time, after restarting app, it can receive the new message.","closed","","JinsikKimSKT","2017-10-31T05:05:28Z","2018-04-03T04:43:06Z"
