There things to consider: If a person has not set up a passphrase, would an automatic backup be of security concerns? That would introduce the need for another UI-element, which is not an option when sticking to the development ideology. And only having automatic backups after setting up a passhprase is opaque.  So I guess the best solution would be to bring in Flock: Let's enable automatic backups only if Flock is present and in a way that only Flock can access the (maybe unsecured) backup-data.","closed","feature,","perguth","2014-08-27T14:04:26Z","2015-05-29T23:45:31Z"

"","1764","Enable sender to delete own messages from all parties in the conversation","While I think this is an important feature, some people were opposed to self-destructing messages. I would take it even further and do similar to [Gliph](https://gli.ph/), where anyone in a conversation can delete messages. A risk with Gliph is their effectively central control*, which the TextSecure team seems to have solved very elegantly.  _* Gliph is quite [transparent](https://gli.ph/privacy.html), and have what they call [Lockdown™ Privacy Protection](https://blog.gli.ph/2012/05/31/introducing-gliph-app-version-1-2-powerful-privacy-for-iphone/). Unfortunately, the fact remains they are in control of the infrastructure and could theoretically capture the passphrase next time you login. Meaning we have to trust them._  > Messages I send other people should disappear on my terms. The sender should have control over her messages, as she's the one providing the content after all.  Without much insight into the project, I'd like to share my ideas. Let's hope they are of value. # Scenarios to relate with  Imagine two journalists discussing some political issue over TextSecure, and one of them loses track of their phone. Say this journalist didn't care immensely and neglected security in a way that his messages are now available to read for anyone in possession of his phone. If the journalist's friend could trigger the phone to delete sensitive messages—provided the phone can reach the Internet—they could rest more peacefully.  **In case you are not a top secret agent**, something easier to relate to may be sending a message to the wrong person. If you realize you've sexted your family like around 10% in a [poll by Recombu](http://recombu.com/mobile/news/half-of-uk-adults-have-sent-a-sext-one-in-10-to-the-wrong-person_M17564.html) have you may want to have an undo button. (how do people accidentally do this?) # Friends and collegues  I care quite a bit about privacy and security, and although I've managed to make my friends care more than expected, there is a limit to what they'll endure. This suggestion would ease the pressure on them to control their habits. They won't use a very secure password if they have to enter it every time to read messages. # Implementation complicatedness  Putting this idea together into the product can get complicated. Should the recipient have the ability to disallow deletion? As he could already be in possession of the information, one could argue it may already be captured and that my idea gives a false sense of security to the sender. I think it's an issue with little impact to an otherwise very valuable feature. Anyway, if we let the recipient prevent such deletion, I would like the sender to be aware of that fact before submitting her message.  If the recipient doesn't agree with letting the sender delete their messages or having them expire, he could disable it for future messages. The recipient may have the ability to disallow deletion/expiry for (specific or all) senders, but the sender must always be aware of which before sending.  **All this causes complexity and new UI considerations. It appears we do not want more of that. Everyone should easily understand their message's fate.** # Solution - Let the sender delete it's own contribution to the conversation. - Allow manual locking of messages as suggested in #283.  That's a simple and in my opinion reasonable compromise resulting in an easy to understand model avoiding added complexity. ## Model  Messages are owned by the sender, who can always delete them, but is also aware that removal from other devices (or human memories) cannot be guaranteed. ## User interface  We have the following alternatives for deletion.  Delete message or conversation... - ...from current device only. - ...from current device and send deletion notice for own messages to other parties. - ...from current device and send deletion notice to other parties, regardless of sender. - ...from other parties only, by sending a deletion notice. ## Potential problems  How can messages be kept track of, and could this kind of ownership break the plausible deniability we currently enjoy? Would the ability to delete any message in a conversation solve that problem? ## Future considerations ### Let any party delete any message  People should manage to handle this as a social issue, where if someone disrespects the wishes of message retention, they're reprimanded appropriately. TextSecure has no role in this. ### Expiring messages (requires UI modification)  Perhaps auto-deletion after recipient specified time period suits better for TextSecure. # Related issues #175, #176, #226, #283.  I love that Signal was just released for iPhone!","closed","feature,","jooize","2014-07-30T22:45:40Z","2015-03-16T12:55:43Z"

"","2114","[UX] [security] Notification if plaintext message is received in encrypted conversation","When somebody receives an unencrypted SMS from a contact with whom s/he previously communicated securely, this can have several reasons: - The contact currently doesn't have internet connectivity/access to their phone for whatever reason - The contact stopped using TextSecure permanently for whatever reason - An attacker is trying to coerce an unencrypted response (requires user interaction), provoke metadata leakage, explain the error message of a following MITM attack, pretend the contact is still alive/free or similar.  In the first and second cases the recipient probably doesn't notice that the received message was unencrypted (which hints at the ""no connectivity"" of ""no TS"" scenarios) and will probably reply with an encrypted push message. This leads to the sender wondering why s/he doesn't get a response and the recipient thinking s/he already did respond. Which s/he did, but accidentally via the wrong channel.

"","2193","Make re-registration of same phone number more userfriendly","When reinstalling TextSecure or switching the SIM card to another phone, PUSH service registration often fails because the number is already registered. This forces the user to go to https://whispersystems.org/textsecure/unregister/ and unregister manually.  Average users don't know that they have to unregister first. They even don't know the above mentioned page. And that GCM eventually notifies the server about unregistration seems unreliable due to the fact that many users really have trouble with this issue and are unable to proceed using TextSecure. (just wondering if similar steps are necessary when web sockets come in...)  I propose to let the registration process check if the number is already registered and automatically perform the necessary steps to unregister and re-register the number. When I understand the unregister web page correctly, this is authenticated by receiving an SMS (or call). I think this is possible when using the same SIM card / phone number.

It should be noted that the first call to canonicalize a number will result in a disk read, meaning it could take a couple hundred milliseconds (saw 350ms on occasion for first call). We can mitigate this by cheating and prime PhoneNumberUtil on a separate thread during the app start, create an E164 cache database, or bitch at Google until they add an option to preload locale data (unlikely).

When I configure Textsecure as standard SMS app and deactivate the internet connections, Textsecure should send messages as SMS also to Textsecure contacts. This does not work for one phone number of my address book (it says error sending message, both for encrypted and unencrypted SMS). The phone number contained a plus sign (+49). When I replaced it by 0049, it worked, so I think the cause for the error message is the + sign.

User Story:  As a new user, when I want to register my telephone number B (SIM card for number B temporary inserted into my mobile phone B) on my tablet A (a device without phone or SMS capabilities) with the TextSecure PUSH server, I have to  - enter the mobile number B into the TextSecure registration form on tablet A - start the registration progress (my device B immediately receives (a first) 6-digit verification code SMS) [X] - wait for the 2 minute time-out on tablet A (because A cannot receive the registration SMS) - press the button on A for registration via an automated telephone voice call - which now triggers the registration process by voice call to device B (user must be capable to understand a female voice, English language. This is a second and different verification code.  Problem: - Not everyone is able to understand the quite quickly spoken verification code on the phone. - Not everyone understands the English message - Users cannot enter the _first_ verification code: because there is no possibility (no input form) in the current registration workflow - Users have to know to wait for the timeout in order to trigger the ""sent me code by voice call"" process  Observation: - I regard the **second SMS by voice as superfluous (in the standard case)**, because I already obtained a verification code on my device B at step [X], when I would only be able to enter this code on device A.  @moxie0 I think the verification workflow should be _deliberately modified_ which solves many issues: before starting the verification process at the device A, after having entered the telephone number,   two new second buttons are proposed - automatic registration (this is the present workflow with the silent SMS to the device where you press the button, but you have to enter the telephone (BTW: Can't this be fetched from the Android automatically?) - **new button: ""manual registration""** (a  verification code is sent via SMS to the device with the entered number) - **new button: ""registration by voice call""** (you receive an automated telephone call on the device with the entered number, and a six-digit verification code in English will be presented)  Advantages of my proposal: - lower workload on TS registration server (the second SMS is not necessary, this step after the 2-minute-timeout is obsolete in the case that the user can receive the verification code on their second device) - time saving: the user does not have wait for the 2-minute timeout - easier: no need to understand the English voice message - verification code text message (SMS) could be i10n/i18n","closed","","Wikinaut","2014-04-20T09:28:30Z","2014-04-21T08:41:42Z"

After hitting the send button a dialog appeared below the message bubble saying something like ""click here for insecure fallback mode"". I had never seen this before and was reluctant to send an insecure message so I ignored it and tried again, same dialog.  I don't recall what I did next to try to remedy the situation, I might have force closed textsecure, I'm not sure. But when I returned to the list of messages, all the contact names where ""anonymous"", but the icon for each thread looked correct. I then tried to create a new text message to myself, this brought up a text thread for a completely different person.  I realized something was very wrong, so I decided to export my text messages and reinstall textsecure.  I did this, and was not able to import the encrypted database. Once it just said ""bad password"", once it allowed me to, but all of the texts read ""bad encrypted message"".  I should also add that I have not been able to ""register"" with textsecure again through sms. I click register and the text never comes. However the calling method works.

Right now I have this text in the phone number field at the top of a thread in textsecure:  ""+1510xxxxxxx - Sms and and generally use the""  (The xxxxxxx are actually 7 digits I just omitted them to preserve his privacy)  This text should NOT be in a field meant for a telephone number!  How did this happen? Well, I got a text from someone that went through my google voice number and was telling me they had a new number so I tried to copy just the number google puts there at the beginning of the text but It copied the whole text. I went into their address book entry and cleared their old number field to replace with the new data. When I pasted I noticed there was a bunch of text after the number so I cleared it all except the number then saved. I'm not sure if i saved the text by accident then edited it again or... maybe i saved the number that it was relayed to first then finally the proper number (not the google voice relay number)... it is a blur in my mind.  When I went back into TextSecure instead of their number under their name I saw part of the text message in there. So bizarre.  The google voice is ANOTHER google account pointing to my number, not the one that holds the address book on my phone. This number was copied from the text that is placed their automatically by google voice, he didnt add his number to the text himself. I don't know if that matters.  I have deleted any thread from him in textsecure and started new ones. I have restarted my phone. I have deleted and created a new contact for this friend in my google address book, both on my phone and in a web browser which then syncs with my phone. I have deleted the whole thread from the other google voice account. I also tried renaming the contact in my address book... nope. Every time I get a new text from him or start a new thread to him this same bad string is in the phone number field under his name. No matter what I do it won't go away. It doesn't matter if I am connected to wifi or not (I have no data plan)... This makes me assume this data is stuck in a textsecure database somewhere.  Why is the data in the contact phone number field not just retrieved from the address book on the phone at some regular intervals or at startup? Why is textsecure holding it forever in some table? The table must be associating a number to a number string... but why? Why not just use the actual number??  I notice that some contact number strings have a +1 in front of the number (USA international code) and some do not even though NO CONTACTS in my address book have this +1... so textsecure has a strange way of handling this data. How does it decide what to make this string? There are errors in this function.  My suggestion is to retrieve this data from the phone address book and store it or maybe refresh it every time the password is entered or every week or something. I don't know the programming aspect...  Thank you!","closed","","landry314","2014-04-25T00:13:52Z","2014-04-30T19:44:30Z"

And it may be violating rule 3, so apologies in advance if this is deemed too power-usery.  Importing/exporting public keys via the sharing interface would be useful for allowing people to easily construct alternative out-of-band verifications.  For example, for people who have verified PGP keys in the past, but are not now close enough to verify TextSecure keys:  1) Share public key -> Sign/Encrypt with APG -> Share via Email/whatever 2) Receive -> Verify/decrypt with APG -> Share to TextSecure, importing the key  Right now, you can export your fingerprint QR code, sign, send and have them verify and scan it, but it's not quite smooth, and the QR seems like a complicating step.  Another possibility is making a URI protocol that TextSecure is assigned to, like `tsfpr::`. This would resolve the import problem altogether, and could resolve something like #1016 in passing.","closed","feature,","effigies","2014-09-13T14:28:02Z","2016-11-19T20:30:54Z"

This commit changes the behaviour in the following ways: - the EXTRA_TEXT string from the intent is always included - the mime-type of the Uri passed in EXTRA_STREAM is deduced via ContentResolver or File extension, depending on the Uri type which makes handling of ""*/*""-type intents possible (and possibly makes textsecure more robust against wrong intent types)  This behaviour is the same as in most other apps (tested Hangouts, several mail apps, G+ and others)","closed","","b0m0x","2014-04-20T14:22:53Z","2014-06-12T17:26:42Z"

After doing some digging I got the idea to double check my phone records to see if TextSecure had received this message via push or SMS. What I found was extremely odd because my carrier usage showed that I had sent the picture message to this random number. The reason I speculate this image has come from TextSecure local database is because I had deleted the picture, from my SD card, after I had initially sent it. There does also appear to be an issue with my TextSecure local database because I tried to send the same friend a picture of my usage summary and after the send button was pressed the picture swapped to a picture he had previously sent me in our conversation. Although it showed the incorrect picture on my end he reported the correct picture did however make it to him. I have attached my original screenshots that show the incoming picture message, an outgoing message from me, and my usage report showing that both messages were in fact outgoing.   ![screenshot_2014-04-21-22-23-57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7367717/2761802/2280ca88-c9e2-11e3-86e2-772d9e147ba9.png) ![usage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7367717/2761803/2287bb86-c9e2-11e3-972f-d4508b71c6bc.png)","closed","","raypoward","2014-04-22T02:24:42Z","2015-03-16T18:49:48Z"

""Disable"" is then encoded as 0.  This looks like a huge change, but it isn't. I had to move everything from the PreferenceActivity to a (Support)PreferenceFragment, for this string of reasons: Problem: The pickers library needs a SupportFragmentManager, but the PreferencesActivity does not supply this. Solution: Move everything to a PreferencesFragment and attach it to a very simple FragmentActivity (that gives us a SupportFragmentManager). Problem: PreferencesFragment is only available in API level 11+, and not part of the support library. Solution: Use an external maven artifact supplying us with a SupportPreferencesFragment.

The bug can easily be reproduced by creating a new group, creating a draft, delete the thread and create a new group. The new group now contains the draft from the old group.  The second commit adds the possibility to save drafts for recipients you haven't written to before, i.e. no thread exists. This also fixes the behavior described by @landry314 in #103. It is implemented by creating a new thread (if necessary) when a draft is saved. When the draft is deleted and no other messages exist in the thread, the thread is deleted in ThreadDatabase.update().","closed","","AsamK","2014-05-18T22:13:44Z","2015-02-13T22:16:42Z"

"","1864","Feature Request: Option to strip unicode characters","Recently I stopped using the stock CyanogenMod SMS app in favor of TextSecure. One thing that bothered me and continues to do so is that there is no option to strip all unicode characters. It would be really usefull to have this option for alphabets that use non-standard characters ( e.g Cyrillic, Greek ). This basically means swapping any non-standard character for its closest counterpart in the default GSM alphabet ( e.g. 'á' => 'a' ) allowing the use of 160 characters per SMS instead of 70. I consider it an essential feature especially if you are not online, as the same text in unicode might charge you more than double than it would on the default GSM alphabet.  I hope you implement this feature. Thanks and keep up the great work! :)","closed","feature,","merdox","2014-08-22T01:05:36Z","2018-04-02T21:26:03Z"
"","2185","Group message issues after device change","Recently as I got a new phone, I experienced some issues with group messaging. As I cannot say, how far they are related, I'll just describe, what happened. - First of all did a backup of the messages on the old phone. - Tried to unregister push on the old phone. This didn't work with some rather generic error message (something like ""unable to perform task"" or so, don't remember exactly). - Installed Textsecure on the new phone, registered for push. - Imported backup from the old phone.  So far, so good. The hassle began, when the first group message arrived. - The message is shown in a conversation named ""Unknown group"". There's no way for me to change the group name or even leave the group to be readded. - After someone else has added me to the group a second time (although I was already part of the group according to his phone), I can see the group name and receive messages – but only from the one who readded me. Messages from other members are not shown. - However, now I can leave the group. After being readded again, I can now receive all messages from any group member again.","closed","","benedetto","2014-12-04T13:18:21Z","2015-05-29T22:21:51Z"

We currently do _not_ have a safe method which allows to translate and adapt the timestamp format and ""at"" string (which separates timestamps in the message details à la ""SENT:  at ""). A wrongly ""translated"" timestamp currently breaks and crashes TextSecure as discussed in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/pull/1309 , so that it cannot be allowed at the moment. > 2. The word ""at"" was not localized, which makes localized (non-English) timestamps looking strange  Therefore I propose _for the moment_ - until we sanitize translation inputs for the timestamp string -  to simply drop the ""at"" word.  Dropping ""at"" simply avoids the need of translation.","closed","","Wikinaut","2014-04-18T01:08:13Z","2014-04-24T19:33:20Z"

This can be disabled by setting android:allowBackup to false in the AndroidManifest.xml. It may not add much security for cases in which the user used a strong password to encrypt the TextSecure files.  But consider the following scenario: - unrooted smartphone - Attacker has physical access for a short period of time - no/weak/circumvented lockscreen password - unknown but weak TextSecure encryption password.  Even with physical access the user isn't allowed to read the /data/data folder and can only do online attacks against the TextSecure password. But if he/she is able to copy the whole TextSecure folder, the attacker can do offline attacks, more or less instantly breaking all simple passwords.  There is also a nice talk, demonstrating this exact problem with password container apps like LastPass (interesting part minute ~13): http://blog.deepsec.net/?p=1740","closed","feature,","generalmanager","2014-04-18T01:47:43Z","2015-12-06T15:11:04Z"

Currently, the only way in which to see the type of the incoming message is via viewing a single message's detail. If the transport changes often, this in impractical, but can be vital in understanding the chances of your own messages getting through.

When looking at a contact's thread, long pressing on messages that include: - a photo or - a number that has been auto-recognized by Android (therefore underlined)   ...  does not work as expected: - Such messages cannot be selected (they will not be highlighted), even though the ""info"", ""delete"", ""copy"" and ""forward"" buttons will show up. - Performing any action on them (like copy or forward) makes it obvious (when pasting or sending the forwarded message) that a different message has actually been copied to the clipboard! Example: I long-press on msg number 10 in a thread, click the ""copy"" icon, then paste in the text input area and a different message (usually 11 or 14 ) is pasted! The same effect is seen with copy/paste, forward and message deletion.  To test whether you're affected by this bug: 1. Find a TextSecure message that meets the above criteria (has underlined numbers or a photo) 2. Long-press to select it 3. Tap the ""copy"" icon 4. Long-press in the message composition area 5.

Now, the phone cannot register with TS at all. Registration fails, because phone does not receive any sms with the required code from TS server, instead error message appears with something like ""Network connectivity error ..."" and TS recommends registration with call message. When doing it, registration code is noted and when enter, TS tells us ""Network connectivity error ..."" and registration fails. - Updated to latest TS 2.1.9 and still the same issue.

I've had this happen with a few friends, even just when they've had to temporarily use loner phones, and it's fairly frustrating. I spend a bit of time each day reading on privacy and security. They're very important to me, and for someone like me/us, having to mess around with this stuff is no big deal. But for the average person?

"","1568","Unable to send PUSH messages (with possible fix)","I've installed TS, and until a few minutes ago I was unable to send any kind of PUSH message, it was defaulting to SMS, all the time. Admittedly there is only one contact in my list that I can use TS with. The app wasn't recognizing this contact as a TS user, it appeared in the list of TS users, but I could only send SMS (which failed right away because I disabled the SMS send function from the options).  From what I can tell the problem is that when I exchanged my identity with this contact (over SMS) I didn't have the international prefix included in his number (he's from another country). This created an entry within my SMS database with that number. After installing TS and being unable to send PUSH messages I noticed this and added the international prefix. Nothing changed and I was still unable to send messages. Upon sending more messages I noticed that at the top of the window, next to the contact name there was still the old number without the prefix. At first I thought this was a display issue, but then I cleared the app's data, redid the initial setup but SKIPPED the SMS import procedure. This fixed the problem. Without any previous SMS to take the number from, the app took it from the contact list (or at least that's what I assume has happened) and of course took the right one. I can now send PUSH without any problem and at this point importing the SMS db worked fine and kept the correct number.  I hope this help somebody and can be fixed.

"","1299","Improve privacy of contact discovery","I've been reading a lot of blog posts, reviews and user feedback about TS lately.  At least in Europe many people really aren't comfortable with the fact that it's currently not possible to opt out of uploading all phone numbers to the TS server, myself included.  This is also not something only the crypto nerds (I mean that in a very positive way!) complain about, but also many average users. Probably because it's one of the few things they really understand in the difficult landscape of privacy and security. And especially the uninformed are very anxious when they are asked to give all their contacts away. They wouldn't give their own number to any stranger on the streets and now they are supposed to give some strangers on the internet all of their friends numbers? The internet is the place where all the russian cybercriminals steal their money and evil smartphone apps are the way they get the TANs for the banking accounts, right?  This argument is typically used in conjunction with something along the lines of ""they are using US(=NSA) servers, oh no!"". The second complaint may not be of any factual difference for the safety of the messages in a good crypto system, but that doesn't matter. It's repeated over and over again in blogs and reviews. Allowing users to opt-out is one of the easier things we can do to make privacy-aware users happy (and kill the US-server argument once and for all).  I am aware of https://whispersystems.org/blog/contact-discovery/ and https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/692 and would like to discuss the possibilities we have to increase the privacy of the TS contact discovery process. It appears that we are currently waiting for the silver bullet to be discovered, which probably won't happen any time soon.  Below I listed the simplest solutions I could think of, which appear not to be overly complex to implement, but still give a good balance between effort and privacy. If you have other/better proposals, I'm all ears! 1. Allow the user to opt-out and download the whole bloom filter 2. Allow the user to opt-out and download a subset of the bloom filter    based on the country code of the contacts. Realistically most people    don't have contacts from more than 1-3 countries. It's a little less    private and people with contacts from India, China and the US won't be    much better off data volume wise, but most users will. 3. Allow the user to opt-out and manually upgrade to push from the    settings menu. This would be typically only used if the user knows the    contact to be registered. This doesn't leak any information about    unregistered users to the server and is basically what Threema does iirc.  If we end up using 1. or 2., updates could be provided with tiny daily/hourly builds. This way the client only needs to know the global/server time + age of his database and can grab only the updates he's missing.  If somebody needs to try push messages with the friend that just installed TS, because he told him about this great and secure app, we simply allow the user to do the manual upgrade from 3.  The privacy-minded users will sacrifice the 40MB+ volume or do it when they are on wifi. I know dozens of people who downloaded gigabytes of OSM maps for OsmAnd.  When other identifiers like emails will be allowed (https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/1085) we are obviously in for another ride. The easiest solution would probably be https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/1259 and allowing the user to enter the identifier manually if they aren't in the same location. Email addresses could be imported from the Android address book and upgraded via 3. tough.  The preferred ""privacy friendly"" setting should be preselected if https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/838 will be implemented.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, I'll appreciate all input!","closed","","generalmanager","2014-04-05T14:08:53Z","2014-04-07T10:45:22Z"

The numbers were entered in MS Outlook and are stored in this (year long default) format:  ``` +xx (xxx) xxxxxxx ```  The sending of the message fails without giving a reason. (I can text these people with the on-board messaging app and I can call them, so the number is correct.)  After playing around a bit, I noticed that the parentheses seem to be the culprit. Any other Android app silently discards them and dials the number. I added a new number manually (without parentheses) and things worked out just fine.  Then I changed the number of the aforementioned friend to not contain the parentheses anymore in my address book and tried to re-add him to TextSecure. Unfortunately TextSecure somehow caches the old/other number somewhere and I'm not able to enter his number in any way. Neither by selecting it from the (now updated) address book, nor by entering it manually without any special characters. I guess #791 is related here.  Both problems are real show stoppers for using TextSecure.

I was able to send and receive encrypted messages to/from this user, but when it came to SMS messages, I was able to send but a lot of the time would not receive them.  I have browsed the GIT issue logs just to check that this issue hasn't already been fixed, but couldn't find one exactly matching my problem. From what I read, it could be a GCM problem.

Since I reinstalled TS on the new system, all of our messages appear as ""bad encrypted message"". I tried unregistering for PUSH and reregistering, but this didn't change anything. Any ideas what might go wrong?  One thing that might be relevant: On the new system, I disabled backup & restore of app settings from Google servers before installing anything.

"","1749","Can't send messages over data [SOLVED]","I recently downloaded and installed TextSecure because of, what I've heard, it's ease of use and security. But now that I have it installed on my phone I realised everything doesn't seem to work as easy as I thought for a newbie user as myself.  My main problem is that for the moment, it seems like the TextSecure app can't recognise who among my contacts is a registered TS (push) user.  I know at least one of my (international)friends is but when I tap on her number and want to send a message through data the only option that shows up is nonencrypted sms. Also, when I untick the box for sms to non-TS users non of the contacts are displayed when I tap the + icon. Is there something I have to do before I can send messages through data except registering for push or is there something I'm missing? Is there supposed the be some kind of notice if you send over data or via sms at all before you actually send the message and green/blue bubble shows up?   I'm running the 2.1.1 version of the app on a G3, I went through the installation process without problems and have registered for push. I had to uninstall and then reinstall the app twice though because the app didn't recognise my password after I locked it. The timed lock feature seems to be broken too because after the set time no password is needed to unlock the app, not sure if that has anything to do with my problem but I thought I should mention it anyway. I'm pretty sure my friend is also running the 2.1.1 version.","closed","","luad","2014-07-27T16:47:28Z","2015-02-16T06:11:34Z"

"","1605","""Send SMS"" in context menu still sends data message when an attachment is present","I noticed the following behaviour:  When an image (or something else) is attached, the context menu options still show ""send unencrypted SMS"" ""send encrypted SMS"" but using either one still sends a TS data message including the attachment.  I think either those buttons should not be shown after an attachment was added or they should produce some kind of error message, telling the user that he should remove the attachment.  Attached is a quick implementation for the second version.  This error continues somewhere deeper, because the forceSms parameter from ConversationActivity:sendMessage:1073 was forwarded to ConversationActivity:sendMediaMessage:1097 and then to MessageSender:send:56 and then to MmsDatabase:insertMessageOutbox:575 and then to... actually I lost track there, but I don't have a good understanding of the transport mechanisms working there.  I think someone more experienced should have a look why the forceSms parameter ultimatively still doesn't prevent the message from being sent as a data message / mms, maybe @moxie0 ?  There still needs to be a user notification, so I think this pull request is fine anyways. Alternatively, fixing the bug somewhere else and just removing the buttons when an attachment is added would be fine for me as well.","closed","","eikowagenknecht","2014-06-13T16:00:04Z","2014-06-14T12:15:58Z"

"","1418","TS caching old phone number? (SMS)","I installed TS while on holiday in the UK.  I started using it as the default SMS app and it picked up my friend's info and number number 07951 XXX XXX from the android address book (4.4, Nexus 5) and we could send messages etc. - So far so good. We are just using plain SMS as my friend does not have TS.  However, I have now returned to the country I live in (Japan) so I had to update my friend's number to include the international prefix +44 7951 XXX XXX in my Android address book .  However, whenever I try to send that person an SMS now using TS it fails to send. the old 07951 number is also displayed at the top of the thread under their name.  I am wondering if TS is still trying to send to the old number which will fail since it does not include the intl prefix? I have tried deleting the thread to no avail.  However incoming SMSes from that friend do turn up in the correct thread (TS seems to recognise that the new international prefix'd number is still my friend).   It also displays the correct intl number in the ""select contacts"" screen when I start a new thread with that friend.  Debug Log: http://hastebin.com/isefolaqid  Line 365 looks pretty suspicious; it looks like it might be assuming my friend is in Japan which implies it is not seeing the new intl prefix.  I have also seen a number of other issues here that look similar but they are usually to do with TS  TS communication rather than plain SMS.","closed","","rurounijones","2014-04-23T04:53:25Z","2014-04-24T23:02:29Z"

The idea is to have a status message with text and/or emojis for yourself and group chats. The problem for this ER is to display the message, because at the moment there's no space for it. If we look at e.g.: Whatsapp, you can see the status in the  chat overview and in a contacts view  Currently you can see the last message in the chat overview. I would rather like to see the status message of a user there instead. So I think it would be a smaller problem to achieve this.  To have a status message in the contacts view is a tougher job, because there is no contacts view yet. What we have now is the stock android contacts view you get, after clicking on the contacts avatar in the overview. So this would be an entirely new view. Maybe this should be a new issue also... An own contacts view would be a nice improvement, because we could add other little informations there.

I have only experienced and verified this issue with messages containing pictures, text-only messages seem to work as expected (apart from not beeing resent automatically via push when internet connectivity comes back, but that's a different issue).  **System:** Android 4.1 rooted Samsung stock ROM TS 2.3.2  **TS settings:** Push messages:                  enabled Receive all SMS:                 enabled Receive all MMS:                enabled  **Allow outgoing SMS to:** TextSecure users:               enabled **Ask before sending SMS: enabled** Non-TextSecure users:       enabled  **Witnessed behaviour:** 1. When trying to send a picture on a spotty connection, TextSecure fails to send it via push and asks to tap the message to fall back to MMS. 2. I tap the message and click **no** when asked if it should fall back. 3. The message then shows the red triangle with the matching text that the message could not be sent. 4. I now select the message and go to details -> resend message. 5. TextSecure **does not** show the ""please tap message to fall back"" dialog again, instead the message stays in the failed state with the red triangle. 6. _When the internet connection comes back, the message is sent via MMS_  **Expected behaviour:** If the internet connection is still not available TextSecure should ask for permission to fall back to MMS once again, as it does with text messages.   **To reproduce:** - disable wifi+mobile data - follow the above procedure from step 2 to 5 - enable wifi+mobile data again - you might have to wait several minutes or select the message and choose resent instead  Log: https://hastebin.com/ipogomogov.vhdl  I have another log ready if needed, but I'd have to scrub this one first.

"","1479","SMS number always taken from contacts","I have a somehow special setup. As I use my mobile phone for business and private contacts I do not send my number when calling in general. So I have switched that off. For people that should see it's me calling them I have added the *31# GSM code in their phone number in the contacts so that my number is shown to them. (I do this because I have to take hotline calls from time to time and calling them back should not show my number). I now tried using TextSecure and found that when I type in a number that's in my contacts (and I type the number without the *31#) TextSecure automatically finds it and takes the number with the GSM code in front of it. Thus no SMS ever gets send because the taken number does not work on SMS.   Would be great to have the GSM code filtered away, thus I could use the Contacts (which is also not possible with the standard SMS app with my setup) fully or at least just take the number I've typed into without looking it up further (this is how the standard app behaves).  If there is any more information needed just let me know.  kr Tom","closed","","Toemmsn","2014-05-11T07:56:59Z","2014-10-16T09:35:41Z"

My ""phone"" is a wifi only device and currently receives SMS via Google Voice, so this didn't work.  I sent him a message saying I can't fall back to SMS and disabled it on my side, and then got one or two from him later saying that he couldn't restart a secure session. I also got a couple ""secure session ended"" messages and the ""send"" UI element turned to the green (should be red, IMO) unlocked one.  Now, with network connectivity good, every message I send results in ""Error sending message!"" with absolutely no additional useful information as to WHY there was an error, WHAT the error was, and WHAT I may do to correct it.  There is no UI element to restart a secure session.  It doesn't exist, or at least, I can't find it in 5 minutes of searching, which means for all practical purposes it doesn't exist.  Thinking to ""reset"" the state between my contact and myself, I selected ""delete thread"" and erased our prior messages. He then DISAPPEARED FROM MY CONTACT LIST (wtf?) and, despite having an identity key still in my contact keys, there's no way to re-add him.  Once I stumbled upon the send message dialog (still with the green unlocked UI element) somehow - no idea how.  Otherwise, it's impossible.  I can't add him using his number, or directly from contacts.  I rebooted the phone and still can't add him from contacts or by using his number in +1xxxxxxxxxx format.

Can't we just ping google or the push server as soon as text is entered, (hopefully not DOSing it) to evaluate if we have a working internet connection? Apparently the Android framework [already offers a function for that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1560788/how-to-check-internet-access-on-android-inetaddress-never-timeouts). Simply checking if wifi or mobile data are enabled is probably not good enough in case of captive portals and patchy reception.","closed","ux,","generalmanager","2014-04-29T13:22:37Z","2015-03-16T18:47:37Z"

In fact it did not even list the to-be-send messages in the thread – pressing the send arrow just cleared the text input field. - After a while a notification was shown, that delivery failed – tapping it took me to the thread for the correct user, but without showing any failed message. - Reinsert SIM X, remove SIM Y - Try to send the messages again, which worked now - Receipient says that the ""encryption is unknown"" (their words), but some playing around made them show up in plaintext anyway. - Reinsert SIM Y, remove SIM X - Try to end the secure session, but that message was never sent - Try to unregister from Push, but that fails (nothing happens, the WiFi icon shows some transmissions initially, but then nothing) and blocks the TextSecure application with the message ""Unregistering for data based communication"" – back button and tapping the screen does not allow me to exit this mode. - After waiting for a long time (maybe half an hour) and returning to my phone, I see the message ""error connecting to server"". - I can use the home button and reenter TextSecure in the thread pane. - Any messages I try to send now will not be delivered – they show up in the respective thread as ""pending"", without anything happening. This affects regular unencrypted SMS as well as TextSecure Push messages. - Messages can still be received, but the notification area will not be cleared when opening the thread, and neither will the thread be marked as seen in the thread pane. - Situation is the same for SIM X and SIM Y – both cannot unregister.","closed","","devurandom","2014-08-09T14:37:02Z","2018-04-02T21:26:31Z"

"","1659","make messages visible for other apps","I am using TextSecure as my default app for text messages. However, there is a difference between TextSecure and other apps like my phones default or Hangouts:  Using Hangouts or the default app of my phone, I can still access my messages via bluetooth. Third party apps like droidstats or airdroid are able to see the Messages and count them.  Using TextSecure, droidstats does not ""see"" me sending messages and accessing my messages via Message Access Profile (Bluetooth) or Airdroid only yields messages of the time before I started using TextSecure.  So I believe that TextSecure stores messages differently, though I don't know what the difference is and if it might be a design-decision (e.g. for security reasons). I see that those third-party apps would probably only work with unencrypted messages, but that would be fine for me.  **tl;dr:** Is it possible to make messages sent and received by TextSecure available in the same way as ""the default apps"" do? I.e. that they are accessible via MAP or third-party apps, even though some of them might be encrypted.  _Disclaimer: I've not developed any app for android, so I have very little knowledge about how things work here and if there is a uniform way to store text messages._","closed","","NobodysNightmare","2014-06-28T14:53:15Z","2017-03-02T18:46:37Z"

"","1459","An alternative to the painful plaintext key comparison","Humans are better at comparing images than comparing a long string. Currently, the latter is used in TextSecure, and it's very inconvenient.  My proposal is to be inspired by Telegram, here is how Telegram users compare their shared key:  ![key_image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5030488/2898441/b37f563c-d59d-11e3-95b5-5d923fd7c30b.jpg)  Important: If we take that path, there is one problem which Telegram didn't resolve and we should - Users often compare their key visualizations over an insecure channel. The most common way is for them to take a screenshot of the key visualization and then send it via Telegram itself. This defeats the purpose of key visualizations,  because Telegram should be considered an insecure channel until the keys are compared outside of it.  The solution is just a simple message like: ""Please compare your key visualizations in real life / over a secure channel, never compare your key visualization via TextSecure itself""","closed","ux,","SafwatHalaby","2014-05-07T04:16:19Z","2015-02-16T06:20:05Z"

If it was not received by the receiver, a notification in the NotificationBar should pop up, which asks the sender if he/she wants to resend the message via SMS.

Steps to reproduce: 1. Open TextSecure plus two other random apps 2. Go to the mutitasking screen 3. Swipe one of the two random apps to the right. This is what happens: the app is removed from the list, the list stays open (expected behavior) 4. Now swipe TextSecure to the right (one other app still has to be in the list)  Result: TextSecure is removed from the list and the multitasking screen is closed immediately.  Expected behavior: Usually, the multitasking screen would remain open until the last app has been removed.  Furthermore, if I want to re-access the multitasking screen directly after it has been closed( by removing TextSecure from the list), it does not react - I have to wait around three seconds before the multitasking button starts reacting again.","closed","","fitsch","2014-05-21T07:23:37Z","2014-06-05T18:08:10Z"

"","2271","Error on transmission results in large message, crashing TextSecure.","Hi,  the scenario: - B sends an image to A over encrypted channel. - There is an error on transmission - A cannot decrypt the message  - Textsecure interprets the message as plaintext (in the pane with all chats it is visible in preview as some base64-string) - On opening of the chat Textsecure tries to render the multi-kilobyte ""text"" message - Crash  This is critical as A can not chat with B any more. The only hotfix so far seems that B sends 10-20 messages to A, so the corrupted message is not visible on opening the conversation, but only after scrolling.  It is still impossible to scroll behind the corrupted message this way, so this is just a temporary hotfix.  Suggested fix: all text messages with more than X characters are rendered only partially and have to be clicked on to be shown completely. This will allow for the corruped message to be rendered partially and removed by hand.  (As a side effect this will allow for easier scrolling beyond long messages)","closed","","phryneas","2014-12-26T16:16:26Z","2015-03-13T21:40:20Z"

"","1700","Type SMS without selecting recipient first","Hi all,  When creating a new SMS message, a user is forced to select a recipient before being able to type a message. It's not uncommon for users to prefer to type the message first, than select the recipient(s). Advantage: if the user presses 'send' accidentally, an incorrect/incomplete message is not sent by accident.  One way some SMS apps implement this, is to have a recipient selection screen show up, like TextSecure does, but which also contains a button ""Skip"" or ""Next"". Pressing this button brings the user to the next screen, where the message can be typed. The top bar of the screen than doesn't display the recipient, but instead shows something like ""Add recipient"" or another visual cue of where to press to select a recipient.  Thanks for considering this, Ludovic  Nexus 5, stock Android 4.4.4, TextSecure 2.0.8.","closed","feature,","ludovicaelbrecht","2014-07-15T07:57:20Z","2018-04-02T21:26:54Z"

I can successfully send and recieve push messages to resp. from other users but one: This very user registered her phone to the push service (is green in my contact list), but TextSecure seems to ignore this fact and insists on sending messages via SMS. The UI looks as if the receiving user doesn't have TextSecure installed, i.e. there is no lock symbol etc.   I used to send SMS messages to this user via TextSecure, before this user installed it on her phone. Is there a way to convince TextSecure to use push? Deleting the existing conversation didn't help.  http://hastebin.com/musugexido  (I didn't find the phone number in the log, sending SMS works, however I disabled it for testing purpose)","closed","","oleid","2014-04-12T21:27:29Z","2014-04-17T08:04:26Z"

However, even though I have ""Complete Key Exchanges"" ticked, the received key was not processed (and since I got about 10-12 messages in one burst, the topmost (the remote key material), was out of sight, while all the others were still encrypted, with the ""encrypted with an existing session"" (or something like that :-) message).  Of course, as soon as I scrolled up and found the key exchange response message (""key"" icon) and clicked on it, everything was fine. I do believe this will be confusing to new users, though.

"","1957","Lost all my conversations (again), how come?","Hey,  I just reached for my blinking mobile (Nexus One, MIUI 2.3.23, Android 2.3.7) to read a TextSecure message. TS has been restarted (it asked for my passphrase) and after entering that, I see TS has lost all my messages but the newly received one (which is from a group now called _Unnamed group_).  Unlike last time, I did not restart my phone, and instead tried to get some logging data out. I have no USB cable with me unfortunately. On a terminal (on device) as root I tried `logcat | grep -E ""TextSecure|whispersystems""`, but all I got was  > W/PartProvider( 2725): Got master secret:  org.whispersystems.textsecure.crypto.MasterSecret@406b92a0  (... or so... beware, I typewrote that)  So I guess the ringbuffer is already emptied, meh.  Do you know of any way of getting my messages and pictures back? Can I supply you with more information so we can get to the cause of this?  Losing the TS database happened to me once before; Last time, I put the blame on the failing battery and subsequent file system recovery. This time, it just happened like that. Of course I tell all my friends to keep backups, of course I have none. So maybe it's just Karma. Meh.","closed","","hacklschorsch","2014-09-29T13:53:15Z","2014-10-01T15:31:22Z"

"","1948","Group chat optimization","Hello, I read on your blog post (https://whispersystems.org/blog/private-groups/) about some optimizations that could be done to group chats. Unfortunately I happen to spend a lot of time in places where the internet connection isn't so good, and this is often a problem. For example: 1. I send a message to the 5 other members of the group; 2. While the application is sending the message to the 3rd recipient, the 1st already has the message and answers back; 3. Since the internet connection of the 1st is better than mine, the 4th and 5th recipients often get the 1st's message before mine -- that is, they see the message with the answer before the message with the question. Is anything being done to improve the speed of messages sent in group chats? It's not only slightly annoying, it's also causing many problems because it's not so easy to understand ""who is answering which message"" when messages come in the wrong order. Thank you","closed","","ghost","2014-09-25T13:32:12Z","2015-02-16T06:42:51Z"
"","2029","Bad encrypted message","Hello, I have to report a weird bug. The other day I sent a message to a group chat. ""N"" receives the message just fine, and answers back. ""A"" responds to me in a private conversation (all this is happening via push), probably saying they couldn't read my message (?), but their message appears as ""bad encrypted message"". Annoyed by  this problem that has always plagued me since the very day I installed TextSecure (it keeps happening every once in a while), I end the secure session with A, unregister from the push service and register again. Now A can read my messages and I can read theirs. Yesterday I posted another message to the same group. A could read it and respond, while N couldn't. However, when N writes me in a private chat between us alone, everything works fine (we read each other's messages). This ""Bad encrypted message"" has been affecting me -- and my friends -- ever since we installed the application. Is there a reason why it happens? Please find a fix, I feel embarrassed for recommending my friends this application and causing them all these troubles.","closed","","ghost","2014-10-23T07:18:48Z","2015-04-24T18:37:39Z"

It slows it so I can't go faster than 30KB/s, but that's better than nothing. The problem is that although I am able to use other messaging applications (internet is slow, but still works), TextSecure doesn't send messages. At all. I do receive them, but I can't send them. They never go from the dull blue to the bright blue. And what's even worse is that even if after I connect the phone to a WiFi, it won't send those messages. Any ideas?

"","2246","TextSecure doesn’t see the external SD card","Hello, I am unable to attach photos and other files from my external SD card to messages. When I select “Add attachment” in a message thread, the file browser only shows the entries “Recent”, “Downloads”, and “Internal Storage”, lacking the SD card (as well as, say, the _Gallery_ app, but that’s of no importance to me) regardless of whether I want to send a picture, video, or sound (see picture).  The SD card is a 64 GB, Samsung-made card of the “EVO” series. Sending files from my old, 8 GB SD card worked and works just fine. However, all the other apps I’ve tried accessing the new card with (_Gallery_, _Total Commander_, _PPSSPP_, …) see, read from, and write to it without a problem. It might be an issue with the file picker, but I couldn’t find another app that uses the same one as _TextSecure_.  My device is a European Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

"","1816","Push messages late and UI and Media Requests","Hello,   It's the second time i post something here so i don't really how the thing goes but i got several thing i would like to adress regarding the app. If i need to open several thread i will :)  1) Usually i don't experience problem with push message but at the moment one of my contact is in China ( i'm in europe) and it appear quite often that messages are delayed (in comparison to whatsapp). The second problem is that when the message is finally delivered - 5-15 minute later- the order is mixed up (eg: a message sent at 12:00 will be after one sent at 12:01). I believe it is more server sided and a connectivity problem but i wanted to address it even though i have no proposition to fix that.  2) There is a total non-sense in the UI with a sliding panel on the left and the option menu. In my sense they should be only one; lets say the sliding menu as it's trendy at the moment hence the option button could trigger the slide.  3) I could be nice to have the media button directly in the conversation ( e.g: next to the lock) and not in the menu.  4) Regarding media again i have only access to the gallery not the camera ( but might be my cellphone the problem ). Hence it could be more comfortable to share ""stuff"" if there was a camera option next to the gallery one.  5)Still regarding the media;  I saw it has been already noticed but as it hasn't changed since.... :  pictures compressions are too heavy. I understand that bandwidth is expensive but the picture are not ""readable"" like that.  I think that's all and hope i wasn't too negative as i really enjoy the app :)   regards,","closed","","chmol","2014-08-09T21:46:15Z","2014-08-10T17:42:19Z"

I am correctly connected to the internet and all the other apps work fine. What's worse is that the stuck message seems to prevent future messages from being sent, too. I have to reboot (just deleting the message not being sent doesn't work), and it's very annoying as many times I don't even realize until hours later -- because I rely on the ""background sending""... bad idea.

That could be useful for some reasons. In my case, I don't send messages to one well defined group all the time, it is very usual that I send a message to a group +/- 2 or 3 recipients. And it is often for only one or two messages. Those are the reasons why I think that having a way to send SMS to multiple recipients without creating a group could be useful.

"","1316","Import encrypted backup does not accept correct password","Hello,  I got my whole family to use TextSecure but sometime after the last update a few issues turned up. One family member kept getting removed from our group (""X has left the group"") and re-adding her did not help. We also could not send her any messages (""Error sending message"").  I decided to reinstall TextSecure on her phone (SGS4), after creating an encrypted backup.  However, using the import feature, the old password was rejected and we couldn't get past the password prompt.  Creating a new account with the old password and THEN importing the backup worked, for some reason, but all messages were unreadable. Randomly sending messages to other family members, she was able to re-exchange keys (despite importing the backup, she now had a new key/ID) with some people, but not with me, for example. I still can't exchange messages with her and I don't see any option to exchange keys again.  So this is half bug report and half plea for help to get things working again...","closed","","Tomatillo","2014-04-07T14:28:37Z","2014-04-07T16:54:05Z"
"","1937","MMS sending (and receiving) fails if on WiFi and APN is set to IPv6","Hello,  I am having trouble sending and receiving MMS on my T-Mobile USA Samsung galaxy S4 (Android 4.4.4) while connected to WiFi. I am using TextSecure 2.1.8.  It looks like the problems have something to do with the switch from IPv4 (on WiFi) to IPv6 on the cellular network.  If I manually disable WiFi and send a MMS through TextSecure on the IPv6 only APN, the MMS is correctly sent and received.  If I manually switch the APN to IPv4 only, then TextSecure correctly sends and receives MMS while connected to WiFi (by transitioning to the cellular network to send the MMS).  However, if I use the default APN of the phone (IPv6 only) and I am connected to the IPv4 only WiFi, sending fails. The logs show that TextSecure attempts to connect to the cellular, but then times out connecting to the MMSC (2607:7700:0:5::ab8:4b81) because of Network unreachable.","closed","mms,","apmon","2014-09-19T18:19:59Z","2015-03-26T23:29:51Z"

Everything seems to work fine including calls, 4g/3g, etc. However, it doesn't detect my sim card properly as it should. So this causes TextSecure to ask for my MMS settings even though it already had them entered.  The strange part is that I can send MMS txts just fine. But not receive them. See the pictures below.

With the latest release, the GMS library will be broken up into individual parts for each major set of APIs. This will finally alleviate the stress of including the full library, which weighs in at almost exactly 1 MB after it's compiled into an app. For example, an app that only requires push messaging will be able to do so while only increasing its footprint by about 75KB. While most users with current, high-end devices probably don't notice the burden, this is great for older and budget-oriented hardware. This change will also go a long way towards reducing memory usage and download size. Oh yeah, and this should cut a minute or two off of compile times.

When I must register in Texsecure to use push message, I must add a number, the 9. So, if you want to call to me o want to send a message to me, you need add a 9. This is only for people outside Argentina.  Example:  +54-9-11245678 (+54 Argentina Code, get off the code 15, and put the code 11)  Possible problems for this: 1. If I want to register in Textsecure without 9, the message never arrive. Neither the call. Nobody knows in Argentina that is necessary this, so we have problems in this step. 2. If I want to send a push message to my friend, I need add her to my contacts with the number (+54911245678) like she would be in another country. 3. If I send her a push message with the number 11245678 or 15245678 don't work. (message incorrect cipher). The most people don't know when they need to put the numer 9 or the +54, so the message never will arrive between friends. 4. If I 'm online (with internet) and send to my friend a message and she has internet too the message arrive correct both. 5. If I'm offline (without internet) and send to my friend a message and she has internet, doesn't work. (message incorrect cipher). This error is really annoying because If somebody of us doesn't has internet, the message says incorrect cipher. In Argentina is very common that some places don't have 3g signal.  I hope this help you. Thanks for all.  Best regards.","closed","","bleiva","2014-05-19T13:58:51Z","2018-04-02T21:27:31Z"

But when the pull down menu from the home screen (ie not in app) is used to view the notification, tapping the notification does nothing.  User is not taken into the app to view the message.  The ""Mark as Read"" in the notifcation area does work however.  Just not tapping the message.  On other phones doing so takes the user to the message in app.  Likewise, when in app, and user receives a message for the first time from any other TextSecure user, and the app prompts in app for the key exchange, while the message says to tap, tapping does nothing.  The app does not respond in any way to tapping the exchange request message.  This occurs even after waiting for a day or so.  The only way to resolve is for both parties to remove the app, re-install, and re-initialize.  This does not resolve the tapping issue.  That still exists, but the keys seem to auto-exchange on their own at that point.","closed","","cyanfr","2014-12-28T13:55:57Z","2015-03-13T21:16:07Z"
"","2152","""Permanent TextSecure communication failure!"" on Android 2.3.7","For about the last two days, I've been getting the notification ""Permanent TextSecure communication failure!"" with the text ""TextSecure was unable to register with Google Play Services. Com"". After ""Com"" I'm was sure there were more letters but they are cut off. I don't know how newer Android versions work, but on 2.3.7 the notifications don't scroll so only by reading through code can I find the text that says ""Communication over the data channel has been disabled, please try re-registering from the TextSecure settings menu.""  Of course, the next problem I have is that I cannot find any ""re-register"" option in the settings menu. Again, reading code shows me that the RegistrationActivity intent is launched by enabling ""Push messages"", which is already enabled.  So, I do that. And now, finally, I get a warning message. Google Play Services needs to be updated to use this. So there's the issue. I'm actually guessing that I didn't need to re-register, I probably just needed to update Google Play Services. Can't say for sure though, as I've already de-registered.  Anyway, the original notification is thrown up by a failed call to GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(context). Instead of just checking for ""resullt != ConnectionResult.SUCCESS"", TS could also check for the other possible return values and tell the user the actual reason behind the error.","closed","","WPettersson","2014-11-28T03:08:04Z","2015-02-16T07:10:46Z"

As soon as a second item is tapped, all menu items but delete get removed/hidden and the title is set to ""batch mode"" with a subtitle telling how many items are currently selected.

There are several reasons I somehow could understand those people.  It's a pity - if such users switch back to commercial messenger apps because of this ""problem"".

"","1762","TextSecure nuking encrypted SMS? WTF?!","Dear @moxie0, the first thing I do before having breakfast is having a coffee and reading the current security news. Today, this [article on Heise Security](http://heise.de/-2269353) was the worst news of the day: Are you honestly thinking that SMS are going to be replaced by data connections in the future and are thus thinking that nuking the **offline** SMS encryption feature (as discussed in #1737) is necessesary? Are you **FUCKING** serious? Excuse my cursing, but I simply cannot believe you seriously decided that!  Up until this point I've been a huge fan of the Whisper Systems products - be it RedPhone, TextSecure or anything else. I've been recommending TextSecure to all of my friends, recommended them to full erase WhatsApp, explained how to connect through TextSecure, even fiddled with their phones until it worked - and now you are blatantly coming along saying that it's ""too much work and confusion"" connecting people through exchanging keys? I really hope that mentioned article is wrong and all this is not true.  **Please rethink your decision.** If TextSecure will nuke offline SMS encryption (which always was the reason why people like me and my friends used it), I'm going to fully eliminate TextSecure and replace it with a smarter choice. And I will not only do that for my own phone, but for every phone if brought TextSecure to. To be honest, even thinking about it hurts! But deep within myself I simply cannot support a Project who eliminates its upmost important feature! Have you ever thought of the fact that there are countries out there who lack data connections due to poverty or war (and probably will continue to do so for the next few decades)? What about the people living in supressed countries with supressing governments?  I very much loved TextSecure, and while writing this, I still do. In the name of all security-enthusiasts and people ou there wondering how to continue or which App to switch to, I am asking you to **NOT** just close this Issue, but rather have a grown-up discussion here, which hopefully leads you  to the conclusion that offline SMS encryption is really important to keep.  **THANK YOU** for listening to the community and not just what the ""trends"" are going to be.","closed","","SecUpwN","2014-07-29T04:56:20Z","2015-03-20T07:16:14Z"

"","1872","Handling of new devices has security implications","Currently, when a new device is set up this disables any old ones, presumably to increase security. However, due to how this is handled in details this IMHO has pretty serious security implications: 1) It makes it much easier to take over an account for prolonged periods. If someone gets access to the SIM for even just a second they can connect to that phone number. They then will receive messages directed to that number. The legitimate user will however not be warned of this in any way. He will get generic ""sending failed"" messages. Worse, if encrypted SMS fallback is enabled, he might not even notice anything is wrong. The recipient will get these messages, but they will not be decrypted, thus making it even easier for the attacker to appear legitimate. Even if the user figures out that someone took over his account, there is no obvious way to fix this. The only one I could figure out is clearing app data, however then he loses his private key and the people he communicates with have no reason to trust him over the attacker. 2) It makes it impossible to securely and with little effort switch to a new device. Normally this would be done by distributing a hash of the new private key via the old trusted channel. However before linking the new device its private key/hash is not known (I have not tried if skipping linking a phone number at first would be possible and help), whereas once the linking is done the old device can't be used to distribute the new hashes.","closed","","rdoeffinger","2014-08-25T05:34:15Z","2015-02-16T06:40:31Z"

It isn't so great when the remote user is e.g. in a building with poor data coverage, has their phone off, etc. Currently I often have messages get through which are never confirmed, but definitely received ... eventually.  One implementation wrinkle I can think of might be a choice between ""confirm all received messages, eventually"" versus ""give up on confirmation after a timeout."" Either way, I believe presenting information on the state of message confirmation, rather than the presence or absence, is valuable to the TextSecure user sending messages.  **These proposals are mutually exclusive.** ## Proposal 1: Confirmed, Awaiting Confirmation, Gave Up - For messages which have been confirmed, TextSecure MUST (and does) show a ""confirmed"" UI element. - For messages which have been sent but not confirmed, TextSecure SHOULD show an ""awaiting confirmation"" UI element. My suggestion: perhaps a clock superimposed on an envelope. - For messages on which confirmation has been given up (perhaps after an hour), TextSecure SHOULD show a ""gave up confirmation"" UI element. My suggestion: A question mark superimposed on an envelope. ## Proposal 2: Confirmed, Awaiting Confirmation, Confirmation Is Taking a Really Long Time but If The Message Is Received It Will Eventually Be Confirmed - For messages which have been confirmed, TextSecure MUST (and does) show a ""confirmed"" UI element. - For messages which have been sent but not confirmed, TextSecure SHOULD show an ""awaiting confirmation"" UI element. My suggestion: perhaps a clock superimposed on an envelope. - For messages on which confirmation is taking a really long time (say, more than 1 hour), TextSecure SHOULD show a ""waiting a long time for confirmation"" UI element. My suggestion: either a clock + question mark / interrobang (‽), or just a question mark or interrobang superimposed on an envelope. If the recipient phone is turned on 3 weeks later and old messages still exist on the sender phone, they will be confirmed. - For unconfirmed messages which are deleted, TextSecure SHOULD discard incoming confirmation acknowledgements.  Proposal 2 should be subjected to threat analysis. (What if the recipient doesn't want their receipt of the messages confirmed after a while?) Proposal 1 seems easier to implement while still _actively_ giving the user more understanding of the status of their message - either we're still awaiting confirmation for a reasonable time or we gave up after a reasonable time but the contact may or may not have received the message.","closed","ux,","deutrino","2014-11-14T05:48:50Z","2015-09-29T23:07:46Z"

The  suggestion that someone could delete the message from all phones remotely let some privacy concerns come up as you should have full control about which messages get deleted from your phone and which do not...  Another idea (what I do appreciate) is the option to disable history like it's possible on hangouts (messages get deleted after some time automatically). For example messages get automatically deleted 24 hours after you read them. This could be an option in the conversation itself and you get the message ""history turned off"". Every participant should have the option to turn it off/on and it applies for all the participants. Like that there's no confusion and all people in the conversation should be happy with this solution and can turn it on/off like they want to do. The messages should of course have another color if history is turned off ;)  I do like this feature, the only privacy concern could be that you can still capture screenshots of it, but maybe taking screenshots could generally be disabled in the app or you get a notification that someone took a screenshot (what should be possible somehow because it works on snapchat e.g., too, right?). Do you think this would be possible or do you have some other concerns? Is such a function too hard to implement or would you even like that feature? :)","closed","","Mihahn","2014-09-04T18:58:43Z","2016-04-16T14:27:58Z"

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time.  Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time.  This would make the user interface more consistent.  When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.","closed","ux,","exploide","2014-10-31T11:56:47Z","2018-04-02T21:31:05Z"

The user can manually trigger the TS server to send a second six-digit-code via the Code-by-Voice-call function, and then enter the second code to finish the registration on their tablet. - My suggestion (TOFU-compliant):  In oder to comply with the trust-on-first-use (TOFU) principle and to avoid the abvove mentioned second registration cycle by voice (in the case of a tablet without SMS/MMS function) I suggest a **code change to allow the entering of the six-digit-code already during the first cycle**.   I mean this:  - already during registration step 2 - while the device waits for 2 minutes to receive the first verification code in a silent SMS - users should be _able_ to enter the (first) code manually in case they are in possession of it because they received it on their other, SMS/MMS-enabled phone device.  In my view this appears to be possible, and does not break the workflow, or introduces security threats. - Advantages 1. Less registration codes need to be sent, lowering the number of ""registration failures during step 2"" (when the device cannot receive SMS, but the SMS was sent to another device of the user) 2. much easier and quicker registration for tablet users, because the timeout does not matter any more: user cann immediately enter the code in the first cycle (TOFU)","closed","ux,","Wikinaut","2014-05-09T06:22:28Z","2015-03-26T23:45:40Z"
"","1341","in landscape mode the send button does not indicate encryption","_observed behavior_: When flipping the phone while composing a TextSecure message such that landscape mode gets activated, the send button does not indicate whether the message will be secured. (I.e. a gray button with the text 'Send' is displayed.)  When not typing (no keyboard displayed), everything is fine.   _expected behavior:_ A colored send button with a padlock indicating whether the message will be encrypted is displayed while typing. (Just as when not in landscape mode.)  _possible solutions:_ Can TextSecure modify the Android landscape keyboard? If yes, then the send button should be adapted. If not, maybe collapse the keyboard instead of sending when in landscape mode? That way, the TextSecure send button would be displayed (and would have to be pressed to actually send the message). While not ideal, this should at least avoid accidentally sending unencrypted messages.","closed","","vks","2014-04-11T22:44:38Z","2015-02-16T05:42:45Z"

"","1780","Vodafone: CallYa Toppings not redeemable","[![CallYa Toppings](http://toppings.vodafone.de/img/topping-fb.jpg)](http://toppings.vodafone.de/)  Hi there TextSecure developers, @moxie0 and all you funky freaks of the GitHub community, let me first say that I still love TextSecure and keep using it until encrypted SMS are vanishing.  Now to the Issue several friends of mine and I do have:  For the ones that do not use [CallYa Toppings](http://toppings.vodafone.de/), here is a short explanation: CallYa Toppings is a bonus program for **prepaid** users, which is offered by Vodafone when recharging the prepaid card. Selectable toppings: Free minutes, free SMS or free surf-flats. The longer a prepaid user is using the same prepaid card from Vodafone, the more Toppings this user will get.  The usual redeeming process is the following: 1. When recharging the card, Vodafone sends an SMS from number `22990` to show available Toppings. 2. (through sending the word `AUSWAHL` to `22990` a user can change the available Topping) 3. The Prepaid user has to claim the selected Topping with sending the word `TOPPING` to `22990`. 4. Another SMS with a verification of successful claim is being sent to the user from number `22919`.  **The Issue:** When sending `TOPPING` to `22990`, my friends and I just get an SMS from number `22919` that the booking code is ""wrong"" and that we shall check it and try again. I've been in a huge fight with the Vodafone customer service, called them at least 10 times, have ruined their shops over here in Germany, wrote multiple heavy complaints to them and was really upset - until my girlfriend noticed that this Issue appeared since we've been using TextSecure. To verify this, I've used the standard SMS application - and there it works flawlessly. Through the standard SMS app, Vodafone recognizes the selection and grants it.  **Questions:** Does TextSecure add special characters to each SMS or modify normal SMS even though sending them unencrypted through the network? Or does Vodafone recognize that I'm using TextSecure and does not want to grant access to the Toppings for users where they can't spy on their SMS?  If there are things to test, data to collect or anything else to resolve this, please let me know.","closed","","SecUpwN","2014-08-02T17:43:47Z","2015-03-13T18:18:22Z"

"","1622","robolectric testing","**UPDATE:** instead of moving our entire source (would be hell for merges and PRs I'd imagine), I modified the robolectric plugin to allow custom sourceSet specification, reliant on https://github.com/WhisperSystems/maven/pull/5. We can still go back to moving the source to match what Android expects by default if we'd prefer this and using the stock Robolectric plugin instead, but this is much more unobtrusive.  So this was a major pain in the ass because of Android's tools team not wanting to make life easy for testers. Unfortunately the robolectric plugin doesn't appear to support specifying test directories outside of the default android locations, so I moved our source folders to match what Android recommends project layouts look like.  This PR is up for commentary on if this is a good idea or not, it may be too painful to justify but this seems to really be the only way to have tests that are TravisCI-friendly and don't require us to have a device plugged in.   The other option is I can submit a PR to the robolectric plugin and we can wait for that to get pulled upstream (and roll our own for the time being if we want this in quickly).","closed","","mcginty","2014-06-21T21:42:25Z","2014-06-23T15:54:52Z"
"","1930","SMS not sent from a person that has data connection to the other that does not have data","**Scenario**: - Both A & B have previously established secure connection using TextSecure, and were able to communicate (they both would see blue messages with lock sign) - Person A has data turned on - Person B does not have any data connection, but has regular phone signal  **Issue**: When A sends a message to B, A sees a blue message with lock sign on, but B never receives that message.  B **only** gets the messages sent by A when B turns data connection **on**.  However, when B sends a message to A, both A & B sees a lock sign next to the message.  **Requesting Solution**: Please make the TextSecure fall back on the SMS connection so B receives text messages from A even when B doesn't have any data connection (secure would be great, but even if the message arrives unsecure, still better).  Thanks a bunch.","closed","","pykhan","2014-09-17T15:00:54Z","2014-09-17T16:23:56Z"
