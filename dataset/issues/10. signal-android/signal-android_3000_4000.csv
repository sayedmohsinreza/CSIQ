"","8612","Image and video quality compression option","This is probably related to #672 but as that issue is closed I'd like to open a new one. Compression seems to be better now, but it's still there.   Please add the option to turn off compression completely for images and videos (separate options). I've seen this in other messengers and it results in me only sending small ""preview"" images to friends because I can't send the ""real thing"". Specifically videos are still compressed quite badly.  And for the bandwidth argument: Where I'm from data plans are really cheap so for me compression is more of a problem than data usage. Also I can use WiFi and thus not care about size at all.  As there are still people that have to care about it, I would suggest an option with default on compression but an option to turn it off and send the original file.","closed","","damianon","2019-02-14T09:32:05Z","2019-02-14T13:22:18Z"
"","9234","Signature APK Hash (SHA-256) Verification Help - Locking Method Using PIN/Password","This is not really a bug but a feature request to improve security of the app.  Request 1: Verifying APK Certificate requires complex steps for a users who does not know about all this. But verifying hash of APK itself is really easy. This by no means is a request to choose one over the other. But rather to have both. One hash for APK and the other for Certificate.  Request 2: Provide an option to lock the app with a PIN/Password/Phrase as an option to/with Fingerprint. This will help users in a variety of situations as you can imagine. For example, someone can easily place target's fingerprint without a user's awareness. While, above options mitigate this case and a user has to be attentive all the time. Downside is the method itself as having access to codes can grant an easy access to anyone.  But user can be advised to use a different code than android's lock screen code to overcome or at least lower the drawbacks of the method.  This is also helpful when the fingerprint sensor itself gets damaged and won't recognize it. Above method therefore will be able to grant user the access with security.

"","8733","Avoid hardware echo cancellation for Fairphone FP2","The issue has as been confirmed by me with the stock ROM as of November 2018, and other users have complained for almost 18 months, see https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fnord/28849 and https://bugtracker.fairphone.com/project/fairphone-android-7/issue/179   ### First time contributor checklist  - [x] I have read [how to contribute](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this project - [x] I have signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://whispersystems.org/cla/)  ### Contributor checklist  - [x] I am following the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines) - [x] I have tested my contribution on these devices:  * FP2, Android 7 - [x] My contribution is fully baked and ready to be merged as is - [x] I ensure that all the open issues my contribution fixes are mentioned in the commit message of my first commit using the `Fixes #1234` [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)  ----------  ### Description  The (mediatek chipset in the) fairphone 2 has erratic hardware echo cancellation. AFAICT, Fairphone's Android 7 is better than 6.x was, but other users report no improvement (of course, users may not notice things that work well...) Even for me it varies, not every call is good/bad. My fix adds the FP2 to the list of devices for which hardware echo cancellation is not used.  I've tested it with an actual hardware device over dozens of calls and not had any bad echo. I have not tested every version of Android, though.  The commit date is old, because I hoped Fairpphone would find a driver fix. There's been no visible progress on the Fairphone ticket, so here goes.","closed","","arnt","2019-04-01T12:26:53Z","2019-04-17T13:55:05Z"

"","8695","Signal restore password after oanbackup backup","Thanks for working on signal, my main messenger :)  Now to the issue: Currently backing up signal is a bit of a pain; I cannot update it along with my other android applications using oandbackup; initially it seems to work but, when I try to restore signal on the same phone, I just get error messages.  This is a major pain, mostly because it comes so unexpected; there is no warning during backup, it just fails on restore.  The current solution is to use the signal backup feature; unfortunately this still falls short, for to reasons: (1) it is a bit of a pain to have to backup signal separately (2) the actual encryption/authentification keys are not backed up.  The latter is an issue, because at least my contacts have by now been trained to simply disregard notifications of my security number changing, because I had two phones breaking this year.  In order to remedy this situation, I suggest introducing a restore key/password; this key could be user chosen or could be issued on the first install. I could safely store it in my gpg encrypted password manager on my laptop and just use that to unlock my signal instance after any backup.","closed","","koraa","2019-03-19T09:43:15Z","2019-03-19T18:42:20Z"

Coincident with this notification, Signal is also using a huge amount of battery.  I have read this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/9uxybo/strange_notification/  And this closed issue here: #8460  Neither of those tell me how to figure out what's going on, nor what to do about this situation. I could live with the notification (though it's annoying), but the battery drain is not workable.  Nothing that I am aware of has changed on my device (no recent Signal updates nor system updates) and nothing that I know of has changed in my network environment - I am sitting at home and the device is connected to my home wifi (same as every day).  Is there any additional information about what is likely to be happening on the device when Signal throws that notification so I can try to debug this and stop my battery from dying in a couple hours?  using adb shell to dump cpu usage gives me this:  ``` payton_sprout:/ $ /system/bin/dumpsys cpuinfo Load: 8.2 / 8.6 / 8.28 CPU usage from 129404ms to 117795ms ago (2019-01-08 11:58:25.085 to 2019-01-08 11:58:36.695) with 99% awake: 27% TOTAL: 15% user + 7.5% kernel + 2.7% iowait + 0.7% irq + 0.6% softirq   103% 11219/org.thoughtcrime.securesms: 77% user + 26% kernel / faults: 22921 minor ```  What is Signal doing????","closed","","pjv","2019-01-08T17:19:04Z","2019-01-29T20:29:23Z"

Key features: * Gradle plugins can be verified (grade-witness doesn't track plugins) * All Gradle configurations are supported (e.g. `java-library` plugin is supported). `checksum-dependency-plugin` intercepts detached configurations as well (e.g. the ones that are created on demand) * PGP can be used for verification. PGP can be used with or without checksum. PGP enables to detect and prevent issues like https://blog.autsoft.hu/a-confusing-dependency/  Even though CONTRIBUTING.md says `PGP is our guide for what not to do`, I still think PGP for dependency verification is an improvement over existing gradle-witness, and it does not really introduce PGP to the app itself.

Previously when sharing an image via signal, a thumbnail of an image you wanted to send would appear within the conversation you were posting it to, making it clear you were sending it to the correct person before you hit the send button.  Now the UI shows a full screen preview of the image with the option to enter text, if you select the wrong contact to send to by mistake in the previous step you will not realise your mistake until you hit the send button.  As a result, it makes it easier to send inappropriate or sensitive material to the wrong contact, the only way to resolve this is to delete the message before your image has finished uploading which can happen quickly in some cases.  This has happened to me twice now, a good solution would be to use the space in the upper left hand side of the full screen image preview which is currently blank to show the name, number and photo of the contact the image will be sent to, so you have the opportunity again to double check the contact and if you make a mistake you don't have to take the risk of not being able to delete the message in time.","closed","","reactionstudio","2019-03-20T13:07:49Z","2019-03-20T23:24:42Z"

This is for screenshots and pictures taken through the app.  ### Steps to reproduce I have seen on other forum posts that this is very sporadic and hard to reproduce.   For me, to reproduce it all I need to do is run the app and send a picture (either from my gallery) or from the in-app camera and send it off to someone. Clicking on the thumbnail shows how degregated it is, and is actually what the other person sees. This is for non-signal users. In the log, I have sent one to a signal user and a non-signal user.  **Actual result:** Resulting image is highly degregated and if text is on screen, illegible **Expected result:** Sending MMS should suffer some quality loss but not completely lose the actual intended image.  This works just fine with other apps like Textra and the default android messenger, the incident is strictly in Signal.   ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 3 XL  **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.32.8  ### Link to debug log   [Log Link](https://debuglogs.org/4c46df1a2faa2f4d16c5460f896cea7885fb0185adad3706a8a40174cef854f7)","closed","mms,","Juush-zz","2019-02-04T08:05:38Z","2019-04-20T23:53:12Z"

"","8882","Multi-part SMS >160 characters fail to send on US Cellular (CDMA)","I'm creating this as a new issue because although there have been issues opened for it before, they've been closed and abandoned, yet this problem has persisted for several years. See #191, #387, #402, and perhaps others.  Basically, long text messages that are supposed to be broken up into multiple messages instead fail to send. This is an issue that affects adoption of Signal for users of the US Cellular network.  I believe the crux of the issue is that US Cellular does not support concatenated SMS, as hinted at by [this Twilio post](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181508-Does-Twilio-support-concatenated-SMS-messages-or-messages-over-160-characters-).   For the record, _all apps_ I've tried that attempt to send multi-part messages / concatenated SMS experience this failure on US Cellular. The only apps that succeed are ones that convert to MMS, like Android Messages or the stock Messaging apps, but from the user's perspective, this is a problem with the affected app (Signal).  Although I do not believe this bug to be necessarily Signal's ""fault,"" it would be beneficial for users if a workaround were implemented to allow the sending of long messages as MMS for those who use the US Cellular network.  Here's one of the relevant debug lines: `D RilRequest: [5621]< RIL_REQUEST_CDMA_SEND_SMS error: com.android.internal.telephony.CommandException: SMS_FAIL_RETRY ret={ mMessageRef = 108, mErrorCode = 100, mAckPdu = null}`  And here's a log: [Signal SMS Send Failed Relevant Logs 20190618.log](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/3303239/Signal.SMS.Send.Failed.Relevant.Logs.20190618.log)  This issue is highly reproducible.

I have exactly this same problem.  As soon as I quit using signal, and switched to the default messaging App, I got the group message just fine.  FOLLOW-UP:  After growing tired of the endless automatic attempts to resend the failed MMS messages to my phone's Signal app, I switched my default messaging app back to the OEM messenger application. This cleared the queue of the residual messages, which were part of a group text a contact of mine initiated. They were not media messages, but apparently group texts are sent as MMS messages, and Signal was unable to process slightly more than half of them, setting up the endless cycle of repeat-send-attempts.  I am a caveman mechanical engineer who can't code his way out of a paper bag regardless of its moisture content, but perhaps a future release of Signal could address this, please?  _Originally posted by @autojim in https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6234#issuecomment-281145831_","closed","wontfix,","poetnerd","2019-01-17T23:48:31Z","2022-02-04T02:03:54Z"

"","8471","Is setting Signal as default SMS app reliable?","I have set Signal as my default SMS app in Android. There are a couple of things that seem unclear to me.  If I open a conversation with someone who has Signal, but I have only cellular and no data connection (data is turned off), how is the message sent? Will Signal wait until it has a data connection or will it send as SMS, or will it let me choose what happens?  I am myself an Android developer, and am therefor assuming Signal is at least using FCM to wake up the phone. However, being a developer, I know from experience that FCM is not reliable in this regard. Many a times it will not wake up the phone. Sometimes you will have to enable/disable WiFi to get it going again. I've had three phones over the last few years, and this has been the case with all of them. This is also the case for Facebook Messenger -- it is equally unreliable in regard to FCM. Maybe it has to do with the phone manufacturer, but I've used three different ones.  So, if I use Signal, and I encourage my friends to switch to Signal, and if they all choose to replace their default SMS app with Signal, I can expect that every message goes over the internet, which requires my phone to wake up if I want to receive instantly, which depends on FCM. How reliable will this be? I'm currently thinking I should not replace Signal as my default SMS app.  I saw it mentioned on Wikipedia that Websockets were used. However, that would require a WakeLock which would drain the battery faster.  I think it would be a good idea to clearly separate the SMS part from the encrypted part, and not to merge them, until FCM becomes reliable for most phones.","closed","","ghost","2018-12-19T12:58:52Z","2018-12-19T15:06:36Z"

Also when installing apps (locally installed by PC) you have to connect to the App Store the first time you start it. You are completely bound to Apple. Offline use is not possible.  3.

Not to forget, iOS has a built-in remote keylogger from Apple. Every keypass is sent to Apple server!   In general, developers don't like iOS. It is extremely limited and always set against the user. Best Signal iOS will no longer support, because iOS and the other Apple systems are harmful platform for developers and users.  It is better to support Android or Android without google service and Linux than iOS. Users always benefit first and it is the most sustainable solution.

It turned out that my system was in a weird state after upgrading from Debian `jessie` to `stretch`. So nothing was or is wrong with signal-desktop and I'm sorry for the noise.  In case someone runs into a similar problem, here's what had happened and how I fixed it:  Similar to https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=834724#15 I had an old package `libgnutls-deb0-28` installed, which seemed to cause the above error. However, when I tried to remove it, it would have also removed half of all my packages, many of which seemed totally unrelated (similar to what was reported here: https://superuser.com/questions/1334780/git-clone-and-apt-error-gnutls-handshake-failed).  According to https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=libgnutls-deb0-28 that package shouldn't even exist in `stretch`, but it turned out that I had `librtmp1` version `2.4~20160119.gitfa8646dae-dmo3~bpo8+2` installed, which depended on `libgnutls-deb0-28`. That particular version of `librtmp1` was left over from deb-multimedia (http://www.deb-multimedia.org/dists/oldstable-backports/main/binary-mips/package/librtmp1.php) which I had used while still on `jessie`. Because that version of `librtmp1` was **newer** than the one in the official Debian repos for `stretch`, (version `2.4+20151223.gitfa8646d.1-1` according to https://packages.debian.org/stretch/librtmp1), it wasn't upgraded with `apt-get upgrade` or `apt-get dist-upgrade`.  So the solution was to **downgrade** `librtmp1` to the version number from the official Debian repos:  ``` apt-get install librtmp1=2.4+20151223.gitfa8646d.1-1+b1 ```  After that I could remove `libgnutls-deb0-28` without too many things removed together with it, like this:  ``` apt-get remove libgnutls-deb0-28 ```  With `libgnutls-deb0-28` gone, the installation instructions for signal-desktop went through without problems.  _Originally posted by @dietmar in https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2483#issuecomment-401047201_","closed","","ukron-ai","2020-01-03T17:57:32Z","2021-08-17T13:55:29Z"

"","8551","Call quality in China and TURN server locations","I am a happy user of Signal in China, but one problem that is really annoying is that call quality is very poor whenever I'm on mobile internet (China Unicom). More specifically, the calls keep breaking up and latency is high and variable, sounding like a congested network. When it's really bad, calls simply fail to connect, or sound like mostly silence with blips of voice.  This happens whenever the TURN server is used (peer-to-peer calls when both are using WiFi are excellent quality). I found out that Signal connects to a TURN server in Amazon's `ap-northeast-1` location in Tokyo.  This location, although physically close to China, is actually really bad for Chinese users, as the connections to all major Chinese ISPs are incredibly congested. This can be quickly confirmed by running an `mtr` or `traceroute` into China, or using tools like `ping.pe`. In all but the most off-peak times, pings are 200+ ms (uncongested ping is around 50 ms), jitter is very high, and packet loss is off the charts.   It's a common issue with serving Chinese users from Asia: Chinese state-owned telecoms play a rather extreme version of the paid-peering extortion game (charging as much as 100x more than prevailing transit prices for paid peering) in Asia. In other parts of the world peering links to China, paradoxically, aren't so congested since there is less point in doing paid peering extortion if pings are already high.  Barring using providers in China or with premium Chinese bandwidth (Alibaba Cloud in Hong Kong, for example), `us-west` is a much better region for serving Chinese users in general. Though the ping during off-peak times is higher, it almost never has crazy packet loss and jitter, making calls much more tolerable. I've tested this out by switching my DNS server to one located on the US west coast --- this causes calls to sound MUCH better.  If I understand Signal's architecture correctly, this should be a simple one-line change in a Route 53 configuration.","closed","wontfix,","nullchinchilla","2019-01-22T03:09:09Z","2022-02-04T14:14:18Z"

This policy will impact one or more of your apps. Only an app that has been selected as a user's default app for making calls or text messages, or whose core functionality is approved for one of the exception use cases, will be able to request access to Call Log or SMS permissions.**  Considering Signal requires permission for both SMS and Call Log, will the functionalities requiring these be removed or not.

This is desired. * When fingerprint is accepted, the icon is also returned to its default state after the animation. _This is not desired, because the app is not expecting a fingerprint (and because the sudden change is jarring for the user)._   ### My solution Remove the code resetting the icon to its previous appearance at the end of its animation in `onAuthenticationSucceeded`. This does not affect the animations and UI changes in `onAuthenticationFailed`.  An instance of `FingerprintListener` is only read in one line of the codebase, so I expect no unintended side-effects.

"","8907","Problems sending video file attachments / limits for sending video files way too low","Everytime I try to send a video larger than a few seconds in Signal – using either the desktop version or the Android app – I get a ""send failed.""  This despite the fact that the video has been shrunk (significantly) using HandBrake or ffmpeg, and typically takes a few seconds to transfer to a cloud provider.  It appears that I am hitting a size-limit, although I am not being informed of such. However, the file is only 195mb.  If the attachment limit actually is this low, please consider increasing it. Videos captured directly on a phone typically are much larger than this.  - [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates  Comment - only found old issues (mostly from 2015) and a case from 2018 relating to re-encoding the video while sending.  - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic   ### Bug description Sending video files results in ""SEND FAILED"" from the Signal desktop application. If there is a size limit in place it should inform of such.  ### Steps to reproduce - Capture video on camera or cellphone - Reduce its filesize to around 1/10th of the original using ffmpeg or handbrake, resulting in a file of less than 200mb - Try to upload resulting (.mp4) file as an attachment  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** The video should upload or the interface should inform the user that the video is too large. However, *195mb* is not by any means large by today's standards, IMHO.  ### Screenshots n/a  ### Device info **Signal version:** 1.25.1, running on Linux  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/ee36b67cce0100c974d3ae7ff6a564c2997de964a802b6f90cf61e64bf2685bc","closed","","Drag0nFly","2019-07-04T12:55:01Z","2019-12-19T17:26:00Z"

"","8808","Use pgp to secure signal code and apk","Currently the operations and software distribution mechanisms for Signal have a few ""bugs"" related to keys and signing.  It would be a good improvement of Signal operations to make use of pgp signatures on git commits. As you can see on https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commits/master, most of the commits are unsigned. Without making and checking signatures, everyone developing or running Signal is forced to trust Github and its employees and infrastructure partners etc to secure the code. I don't want to trust Github with that.  My team mandates pgp signature on all commits, including merges. It would be great if signal could do the same. Setting up commit signing is actually quite easy. See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work  Currently, the apk listed at https://signal.org/android/apk/ only uses the built in android apk signing mechanism. It would be an improvement to also include pgp signatures. This is the general purpose standard that is used by developers of operating systems and various other systems. It is much easier to check a pgp signature than the android apk signature, and gpg comes by default with almost every linux distro.  It would be good if the signing keys were available in other places. Having the signed apk and the signing certificate hosted on the same site does little to secure it from tampering. Anyone who can changed the hosted apk can replace the listed certificate. Web of trust for pgp keys helps with this. You can also share the keys/certificates on other platforms. Some of the members of the Signal team are public facing people. Having them share key fingerprints on github, social media, blogs, presentations, etc. helps build confidence that the keys are legitimate.","closed","","gabegattis","2019-05-10T20:49:07Z","2019-05-13T17:20:36Z"

"","8716","Sending to wrong recipient + scrambled message history => Implementation of non regression tests?","Again, I was faced with bugs in basic signal functionning: - I was having a conversation with a friend within Signal, using non-encrypted SMSs, then I wanted to share a picture with another friend.  I switched to Android's Gallery, selected a picture, clicked on ""Shared"", then selected Signal, then selected my 2nd buddy. Everything went fine until I went back to my initial conversation and discovered the picture was sent to the 1rst buddy - the one of the initial conversation -, not the second one - the intended and actually selected recipient !!!! I've been confirmed the image was received by the 1rst - UNintended - recipient and never by the 2nd - INtended- recipient.  - Another time (after several reboots of my phone), I opened Signal, selected an intented recipient - a friend - , and discovered in the history of previous messages, many messages&pictures that I sent some time ago to another recipent - my sister -. I can confirm that my sister had received the intended message at the time, so it's ""just"" the history that was scrambled/assigned to the wrong recipient - this time (and is still wrongly assigned after the installation of the latest version of Signal)...  What is the point of using a ""secured"" cyphered messaging tool, if private/confidential messages are sent to random recipients instead of the selected one ?  PS: I think I've already talked about that in a previous bug report: it would be great (and is usually considered a mandatory&good programming practice these days) to jointly develop a set of unit/non-regression tests together with each piece of code, in order to ensure that basic functionality is NOT broken by any later code addition, for instance checking an updated version of the app BEFORE sending it into the wild PlayStore. Would you consider respecting this good practice?  In order for this critics to remain constructive, here is a basic set of tests that I would consider mandatory to pass before releasing any new update of the Signal app: - testing that non-cyphered call works (rings, calls the correct person, has 2-way working sound, call history is correctly appended) - testing that cyphered call works (rings, calls the correct person, has 2-way working sound, is actually cyphered, call history is correctly appended) - testing that non-cyphered SMS works (sends correct text, sends text to the correct person, message history is correctly appended) - testing that cyphered SMS works (sends correct text, sends text to the correct person, is actually cyphered, message history is correctly appended) - testing that non-cyphered MMS works (sends correct text & various media, sends text & various media to the correct person, message history is correctly appended) - testing that cyphered MMS works (sends correct text & various media, sends text & various media to the correct person, is actually cyphered, message history is correctly appended) - testing that history remains the same before/after any update of the app - testing that configuration (MMS proxy, etc) is not touched after any update - tseting that notifications appear when receiving calls/SMS/MMS","closed","","liar666","2019-03-28T13:57:00Z","2020-03-15T21:18:13Z"

"","9277","Contacts show phone numbers instead of names","@automated-signal erroneously closed the following issue: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/3810 Which I regrettably must report is still not fixed. Therefore I open this issue in the hope that it too is not erroneously closed and discarded.  Signal app version **4.51.6** installed from the Play store on 15/12/2019 has the following bug:  The contacts importer (contact import routine at first run) fails to request Google phone number contacts. The failure to request and import Google account stored phone number contacts results in SMS message threads imported into signal which use contacts stored by Google, to display without the contact's name (as displayed in the contacts address book of the phone) and to instead display only the phone number prefixed with the international code.  The short term fix for this issue is to open the phone's contacts app, tap on the three dots in the top right hand corner of the app, tap Import/export, tap Share all contacts, wait until the notification appears announcing that the contacts are ready and tap on said notification, when prompted: select the **Signal** app and the contacts will then be imported. Voila! The names of the contacts will now appear in Signal.  The long term fix for this issue is to ensure that signal's contact importer pulls Google account stored contacts in the future.  To pull Google account stored contacts the handset must first be connected to the Internet.  The issue makes Signal look broken. I was about to uninstall the app because it looked very buggy, until I stumbled upon https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/3810 and worked out what was going on.","closed","wontfix,","heydojo","2019-12-15T12:27:17Z","2022-02-04T07:38:18Z"

So far to get the screen lock to function I need to reboot my phone, or use force stop. I expect this behaviour from experience with Microsoft Authenticator, and Authy. In both of these apps clicking ""square"" then ""X"" will close the app, so next time I open I need to use the screen lock function.  **Note:** I didn't use the ""Screen lock inactivity timeout"" feature, because it only seems to set to 00:01:00 no mater what I put for time, and I don't ""really"" understand what the feature means or does, so I have it set to none. I tried 20s as a quick test and the lock still didn't function as I expected, so this bug is under the condition of screen lock: ON, time out: none.   ### Steps to reproduce - first install of signal - sent signal to contacts - set signal to use SMS - Settings > Privacy > Screen lock - Screen lock inactivity timeout: none - clicked ""square"" then ""X"" to close signal app - opened signal expecting screen lock (similar to authy), but signal just opened - rebooted phone - screen lock worked as expected - clicked ""square"" then ""X"" to close signal app - opened signal expecting screen lock (similar to authy), but signal just opened - android app setting ""Force Stop"" on Signal app - screen lock worked as expected  **Actual result:**  - clicked ""square"" then ""X"" to close signal app - opened signal expecting screen lock (similar to authy), but signal just opened  **Expected result:** - click ""square"" then ""X"" to close signal app - open signal, and screen lock is required (similar to authy)  ### Device info **Device:** motorola Moto G (4) (athene) **Android:** 7.0 (6, NPJS25.93-14.7-8) **App:** Signal 4.49.18 (5651)  ### Link to debug log I didn't want to use this, because I am not familiar what information is in the logs, and they are very lengthy to read the whole thing to find out.","closed","","jamesjahraus","2019-11-13T00:46:25Z","2019-11-15T16:22:31Z"

After setting Settings > Privacy > Screen lock to OFF, I still get occasional reminders to enter my screen lock pin, to train me to remember it. I am expecting that if I turn the Screen lock to OFF the reminders will also turn off.   ### Steps to reproduce - Settings > Privacy > Screen lock ON - Sometimes get Screen lock pin reminders - Settings > Privacy > Screen lock ON - Still sometimes get Screen lock pin reminders  **Actual result:**  - When I turn off Screen lock, I keep getting screen lock pin reminders.  **Expected result:** - When I turn off Screen lock, screen lock pin reminders stop.  ### Device info **Device:** motorola Moto G (4) (athene) **Android:** 7.0 (6, NPJS25.93-14.7-8) **App:** Signal 4.49.18 (5651)  Note: I also logged https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9182 and from searching through the issues there seems to be many bugs around the screen lock feature. I could be helpful to look at the screen lock systemically and perhaps simplify it generally. See also https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8603 https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7962  Suggestion: Authy's implementation is quite simple, i.e. whenever Authy is opened must enter pin lock code. This could work for Signal. It could be helpful to simplify this feature as a general solution to all these bugs.  As a user this is my experience of the screen lock feature: I noticed when Screen lock is ON it wasn't locking as I expected, the inactivity timeout could not be set, nor work as I expected, then when I turned it off Screen lock reminder continues to activate.

Some combinations are not secured:  Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode: Under a given key, any given plaintext block always gets encrypted to the same ciphertext block. Thus, it does not hide data patterns well. In some senses, it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality, and it is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols at all. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) with PKCS#5 padding (or PKCS#7) is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. In both cases, Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) with no padding should be preferred.","closed","","jsprieto10","2019-11-22T16:07:27Z","2019-11-22T18:12:35Z"

No contacts, no conversations, no files present.  **Actual result:** No contacts, no conversations, no files present. **Expected result:** See my contacts, my conversations and my files. Be able to keep chatting with my contacts.  ### Screenshots Make a clean install and there is your screenshot.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy s5 **Android version:** rooted 4.4.2 **Signal version:** 4.34.8 (downloaded from Google Play Store)  Apps on my phone are extremely restricted and so is Signal. I will omit any privacy/security holy wars, so just deal with the fact. Signal has no access to contacts/calls/sms/and many more, as I never needed that functionality and it worked like that just fine for years, I'm on signal from the days when it was 2 different apps (almost from the very beginning of its existence).  There seems to be a few gigs worth of data related to Signal. Killed signal, to make sure that it won't kill more than it possibly did already and currently in the process of duping all of it. I'll try to scrape everything possible out of it, since my last Signal backup was performed a while ago. Probably I'm done with signal. If things can disappear just like that then it's way too extreme and risky.  I'm only interested in messages text and received files. If you have some tips on recovering those from duped data I'd appreciate those. Also after I'm done with duping 100% of everything remained, hopefully it's not too scattered all over the place, I will be able to test your alpha/beta/gamma/whatever versions, to check if they can return everything back, but that's where my help ends, not going to submit my files or anything like that.  P.S. By the way - all settings remained, just in case my comment on screenshot was somewhat misleading for you.","closed","wontfix,","RESTORESIGNAL","2019-02-27T21:33:36Z","2022-02-04T14:14:32Z"

One colleague left the company and hence left the signal group. Now he is *still* receiving messages *sometimes* from my signal account, but not from any other group member.  ### Steps to reproduce  I am completely unsure how to reproduce this, but it looks like someone has to leave a signal group and then sometimes some people will still receive messages from some group members, so:  1. Leave a signal group.  **Actual result:**   2. Still receive some messages from a limited set of group members.  **Expected result:**  2.

I synced to my desktop a few days before the event (4 days before according to the app). 2. I was out of cell range and had no data 3. I came into cell range  Actual Result:    Coming into cell range, 99% of my messages and groups were gone and I was notified for a couple of messages with ""Message encrypted for non-existing session"".  Hours later, I checked that my Desktop which was synced previously had my messages. It did.  Minutes after checking the Windows box, messages about ""x is on Signal!"" started pouring in to my Android device. Looks like every contact in my phone book (who has Signal).  To be clear: the Desktop client seems to work as expected and the Android client has the issue.  Expected Result:  I expected Signal to keep working as usual and my messages to be retained.    ### Screenshots Example message (I saw 4-5 of this shape) ![Screenshot_20190715-172722](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025722/61259232-2ace2d00-a72e-11e9-9522-3a6722830870.png)  All notifications incorrectly coming in for users joining Signal (they were previously on Signal) ![Screenshot_20190715-182338](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025722/61259233-2ace2d00-a72e-11e9-8a31-05476cdb5b56.png)    ### Platform Info  Desktop Signal Version: 1.25.3 Android Signal Version: 4.43.8    Operating System: Android 7.1.1    Linked Device Version: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1    ### Link to Debug Log  Android: https://debuglogs.org/b6412ca09050a8cd50be80447c1a3fa9fc9b44798af2e36f4feb1cc387e28e3e Windows PC (works as expected): https://debuglogs.org/84c3608870760c0333ce123cff9087ee48f1c4f4700f7fb18e8da163d12211dc","closed","wontfix,","crimzor","2019-07-17T02:21:03Z","2022-02-04T11:03:21Z"

Invoking a manual group/contact import works, however.  ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a group on Android without a group image. 2. Update the image on Android. 3. Open Signal Desktop and wait. 4. Invoke manual contact import.  **Actual Result**: The group is fully functional (members, name, etc.), but the group image is missing on all linked devices (A and B) after step 3 (even after hours and updating the image several times).  After doing the manual contact import (step 4) on one linked device (A), the image also shows up on the other linked device (B). This behavior applies also to other members of the group. They can instantly see the image on Android, but not on any linked device, unti they invoke the contact import.  **Expected Result**: The group image should be there right after the update.  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 8.1 **Signal version:** 4.35.1 **Linked Device Version:** 1.22.0-beta.2 (both A and B as well as other group members)  ### Link to Debug Log Android: https://debuglogs.org/6ceab96a79b5a9a412250af5376bd28935463c9fafd34fe271b696f99fa6510a  Linked Device A: https://debuglogs.org/dbc1b9fdc5c3f66192bda4107f211ff63b53ee4d4a9129c94fbf71aa189ff5f1  Linked Device B: https://debuglogs.org/b18a4a5e6f355872b350dda2bccf0b4f951a8df4a44ea6881e73e1d7e75d8de6","closed","","minnmann","2019-03-08T23:47:10Z","2019-06-25T08:43:29Z"

I can still send audio messages to others, and they can play them, but I can't play any of them, regardless of whether they were sent or received. This includes messages that previously played just fine.  Workaround is to clear Signal's memory in the Android Application Manager. That's hugely inconvenient, of course, because it deletes the entire message history and forces SIM reregistration.

Keep in mind, both sides have their read indicators enabled and thus opted that they want to see this information.  ### Steps to reproduce - with read receipts enabled for both you and your contact, make sure both you and your contact have opened a conversation on your screens - send your contact a message - after receiving this message your contact immediately leaves the conversation - send another message  **Actual result:** Both messages have been send in short sequence to each other. only the bottom message shows indicators, and it shows the delivered indicator not the read indicator **Expected result:** The first message has a different read status, and should show its read indicator despite these messages being send in short sequence to each other, so I can see that this earlier message has in fact been read (or at least been displayed to my contact).  ### Screenshots  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 9.0 **Signal version:** 4.50.1  ### Link to debug log  Design error, log not relevant.  ### Closely related enhancement Note that the in the discussion on the community forums, another issue was discussed where status is shown on messages where this is not necessary. https://community.signalusers.org/t/always-show-read-indicator-on-last-read-message/10107/7?u=meteor0id This may be addressed as well.","closed","","Meteor0id","2019-11-15T17:43:22Z","2019-11-15T18:35:44Z"

These are hiwever bugs, it only seems like blocking can be circumvented, but in fact if you have blocked someone, he also won't receive anything from you.  This report actually covers two bugs: 1. If you call the blocked person, it seems to work but doesn't. The call starts and keeps attempting to connect witjout a warning that it never will connect. 2. If you select a message, the composebar is no longer hidden and you can attempt yo send a message. Even worse, it looks like the message was both delivered and read, while in fact you have blocked this person and that also means you cannot send to this person. That message had not been send.  Additionally one tester (Johan) mentions that he still gets a notification after being called telling him he was called, even though he was blocked. We will attempt to reproduce and add a debug log of his as well if we can.  ### Steps to reproduce - Block John - call John - select a message in the chat, and note your composebar is back. Even after unselecting. - write a messege and send. Note it shows as read. It can't be read, it wasn't even send.  ### Screenshots  ![signal-2019-10-29-214929](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/67810090-3570c000-fa9a-11e9-93de-8c3756279ec8.png) ![1572384215541](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/67810395-d2cbf400-fa9a-11e9-9d0b-855d01496387.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Manufacturer Model XVI **Android version:** 9.0 **Signal version:** 4.49.11  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/c438fdd62eda32cdd45363fca306f4a5ef77ef22b6dc861a16f54c618e63335f","closed","wontfix,","Meteor0id","2019-10-29T21:27:14Z","2022-02-03T23:40:48Z"

This behavior is noticeable even if the application is out of focus or placed in the android app dock.  ### Steps to reproduce - place a signal call - when the app is in focus or when docked and minimized in the android dock place your finger over the front of the screen in the general vicinity of the proximity sensor, on two different devices this was reproduced a couple inches (3-4) away from the screen  **Actual result:** Screen will go black until sensor is no longer obstructed. In some cases when the application is docked, the screen will never go to sleep in accordance with what is configured in the Android system settings and will only go to sleep when the proximity sensor is obstructed. The power button in this case is non-functional when attempting to use it to shut the screen off. **Expected result:** The sensor should not be so sensitive, the sensor should also not be honored when the application is docked which would result in accidentally tripping the sensor when doing other tasks on the phone. Instead, when the application is out of focus the system should fallback to the screens power settings configured in the Android system settings. In it's current state, these sleep settings don't appear to be honored at all during a signal call.  ### Screenshots  N/A  ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact **Android version:** Android 9 (47.2.A.11.228) **Signal version:** 4.50.5  Issue was also reproducible on a Google Pixel 2 using the latest version of Android and Signal available for that device.  ### Link to debug log  N/A","closed","wontfix,","moozhub","2019-11-23T14:37:50Z","2022-07-21T19:09:52Z"

I noticed this started happening a few months back. At first it was mysterious that my messages were somehow showing up unread, but I eventually started noticing that I'd go back to one of my computers with the desktop app on it and the conversation that was being silenced was open in the client. I have Signal Desktop installed on 3 machines, and I habitually leave the app open on all of them while they're on (i.e. Signal starts with the OS and never gets exited, even through the OS being put to sleep, etc) so that I don't have to wait forever for the message history to sync when I need to send a message. This failure mode is especially sinister because you will receive notifications for other conversations while one of them is being silenced. The other night I was waiting for a friend to respond to me about our impending plans while I chatted in another conversation, only to discover that while I had the Signal app open in my hand he'd messaged me a half hour earlier but the notifications hadn't shown up and his conversation was marked read.  It is good that Signal doesn't seem to spam every device if I'm active on one, but it should at some point notice when I go away, and then resurface any messages that showed up before it noticed. E.g. if I'm active at time X-1, got inactive at time X, Signal times out at X+timeout, any messages that arrived between X and X+timeout should be resurfaced on all clients.  I haven't grabbed logs because when this crops up, it's usually highly inconvenient, but it's possible that OS sleep is involved since the devices that I'm sure have cause the problems are both laptops that spend some portion of their life asleep.  ### Steps to reproduce - Initiate or respond to a conversation on a desktop version of Signal - Walk away from the computer - Have your contact send you a follow up message  **Actual result:** 1) My phone does not produce a notification letting me know I've received a follow up message. 2) When scrolling through my list of conversations, the conversation will be marked read. **Expected result:** 1) If I have not read a message I should get a phone notification. 2) If I have not read a message, the conversation shouldn't be marked read.  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 3 XL **Android version:** 4.39.4 **Desktop version:** 1.24.1","closed","","IcyMidnight","2019-05-21T18:40:47Z","2019-07-24T14:13:10Z"

For the sake of the example, let's say your number is +33 6 54 32 10 98. - Then move to another country, ie. French Polynesia with the country code +689. For the sake of the example, let's say your number is +689 87 65 43 21. - Now, being in the French Polynesia country, receive a classic SMS from a Polynesian number (ie. +689 87 11 22 33)  **Actual result:** Signal sort that sms under the **+33**87112233 number. And if you try to answer in that thread, Signal tries to send your response to that unknown number. **Expected result:** Signal should detect that the number is coming from the French Polynesia network, and hence should sort it under the **+689**87112233 number thread.   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 3 (ONEPLUS A3003) **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.40.4  ### Link to debug log http://paste.debian.net/1084337/","open","Multi-SIM,","AlexandreBonneau","2019-05-29T06:50:16Z","2022-07-15T16:51:01Z"

The recorder app used is the default LineageOS Recorder app -> https://review.lineageos.org/q/project:LineageOS%252Fandroid_packages_apps_Recorder  The app produces an .wav file.  I can play the audio by: - Using signal-desktop in-app player - Long-tapping the audio message, saving it as a .wav file on the internal storage and playing it using an audio player.  Obs: When trying to save the file using signal-desktop, tho, it prompts to save it as a .x-wav file.

The only change I made to the whole system between the time when signal was working and now was installing Outlook and adding an account for this to connect to our exchange server.  ### Steps to reproduce - launch signal  **Actual result:** Signal crashes **Expected result:** Signal should start  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** LineageOS 16.0 (= Android 9.0) **Signal version:** 4.52.4  ### Excerpt from logcat  01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: signal-bounded-2 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 12583 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.RecipientDatabase$MissingRecipientError: Failed to find recipient with ID: null 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.LiveRecipientCache.getSelf(LiveRecipientCache.java:95) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.Recipient.self(Recipient.java:268) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.conversationlist.-$$Lambda$4R-k00CnaOfHk3PXlQVrsbtQQhM.run(Unknown Source:0) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.concurrent.SimpleTask.lambda$run$1(SimpleTask.java:24) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.concurrent.-$$Lambda$SimpleTask$W3hwqgjBrQ_4y_Y0MHEF08-is-w.run(Unknown Source:6) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1167) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:641) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E AndroidRuntime:        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:764) 01-10 18:17:51.471 12583 12736 V Cursor  : Filling cursor window with start position:0 required position:0 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:  01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger: org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.RecipientDatabase$MissingRecipientError: Failed to find recipient with ID: null 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.LiveRecipientCache.getSelf(LiveRecipientCache.java:95) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.recipients.Recipient.self(Recipient.java:268) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.conversationlist.-$$Lambda$4R-k00CnaOfHk3PXlQVrsbtQQhM.run(Unknown Source:0) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.concurrent.SimpleTask.lambda$run$1(SimpleTask.java:24) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.concurrent.-$$Lambda$SimpleTask$W3hwqgjBrQ_4y_Y0MHEF08-is-w.run(Unknown Source:6) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1167) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:641) 01-10 18:17:51.478 12583 12736 E UncaughtExceptionLogger:       at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:764) 01-10 18:17:51.496   928  3140 W ActivityManager:   Force finishing activity org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity 01-10 18:17:51.509 12583 12736 I Process : Sending signal.

The problem does not occur when the other person is using Signal or when I am using another SMS app.  ### Steps to reproduce - Ensure Signal is the default SMS app - Ensure read receipts are enabled in settings - Open the app - Send a SMS message to any person without Signal - Verify through other means that the person has indeed opened the message in their messaging app  **Actual result:**  SMS messages always display the 'sent' icon, even when the message is delivered and explicitly read  **Expected result:**   Each SMS message's icon changes to the delivered icon when the message is delivered and to the read icon when the message is read.  ### Screenshots  Behaviour in **all** SMS conversations (i.e. with people with read receipts enabled):  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1783464/54577442-db6b3080-49c9-11e9-9a8c-ba5cfea7ef18.png)  For reference, here is the behaviour when texting Signal users: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1783464/54577597-69dfb200-49ca-11e9-9776-4e3cd0074c75.png)     ### Device info **Device:** LGE LG-M320G (lv7_global_ca) **Android version:** 8.1.0 (183371050e7a1, OPM1.171019.026) **Signal version:** 4.35.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/3bf012ef6f3a2953c420098728e6a68776d28a053ef1284d357c9af3eae419e2","closed","","jmoore34","2019-03-19T03:17:50Z","2019-03-19T18:29:13Z"

If I send a SMS and display the SMS details, the Via field is ""SMS"" so I don't know which SIM was used. This is regardless of the ""Preferred SIM for SMS messages"" setting.  It also seems that some incoming messages on the first SIM card (at least) are eaten away, i.e. never received, no notification is show, it doesn't show in Signal at all.  This used to work perfectly a few weeks ago.  Google's Messages app as the default SMS app doesn't have this problem: I can select the sending SIM and messages are received as expected.  ### Steps to reproduce - set Signal as the default app for SMS on a dual-SIM equipped phone - try to select the originating SIM card before sending a message - try to send a SMS to the number corresponding to the first SIM card.  **Actual result:** no SIM selector is show, no information is available on which SIM was used for sending, incoming SMS message is not received. **Expected result:** SIM selector shown and working, incoming SMS messages are received.  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_2019-05-23-12-13-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6949106/58245277-b17d1400-7d54-11e9-8ff3-ccb44be247a5.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Oukitel K4000 Pro **Android version:** 5.1 **Signal version:** 4.40.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/bc3fa19415028ca3f319e919bcc57fbeb77732ba3f3f2dd3af543194167eaa40","closed","Multi-SIM,","gjankowiak","2019-05-23T10:41:53Z","2020-05-04T21:52:56Z"

If I want to share the image, I have to 'share' it again. Since Signal is unlocked this time, it works fine.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open an app where there is an image to share (I've tried it with Google Photos and with Telegram) - click on the Share button - Choose Signal - Signal lock screen appears; touch fingerprint sensor to unlock Signal   **Actual result:** The phone exits Signal, and the original app with the image I want to share is shown.  **Expected result:** See Signal's contact selection screen   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.30.2  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/dd85aca7d7993dceb30458f819e579ca245d569cf2166ae684e49e2517c37b6a","closed","","dinosmm","2018-11-10T09:10:21Z","2020-12-04T16:00:05Z"

It just shows the generic video icon. The video does play however when pressing it.  In addition to that when I tried to forward the video message I noticed that while I was in the compose window it did show a preview of the video. After sending it though I also got the generic video icon in the conversation. Since I run LineageOS and thought it might be related to that I forwarded the video to a samsung s9 device running it's stock android and Signal version 4.47.4. On that device it was the same behaviour. So also no preview. Now as a final test I first saved the video and after that I've send it. Here I noticed some different behaviour. First if I select the video by pressing the gallery button and than select the video I do not see a video preview however if I select the video by pressing the file attachment button it does show the video preview and play button. I will send the video to the support mail.  ### Steps to reproduce - send specific video - check both send and receive conversation  **Actual result:** No video preview is shown. **Expected result:** Video preview and play button is shown.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S5 **Android version:** 9 (LineageOS 16) **Signal version:** 4.47.4  ### Link to debug log link of initially receiving the video (around 2019-09-10 12:20) https://debuglogs.org/c966554e0dffef4df658d55a20bf3a7a700a4ac05abc951a71f4453b24dacae8 link of log while sending it by gallery attachment button and file attachment button (around 2019-09-11 09:20) https://debuglogs.org/4f4649faab61b2c7435bfc519a0c423ddad041188611cfcd2d79558885a76e9b","closed","","bme13","2019-09-11T08:10:16Z","2021-05-31T14:47:41Z"

The Signal app does not crash.  This behavior persists regardless of whether call notifications are turned on within Signal's notification settings.  I originally posted this on #7828 because I had been having the ""calls are not silent in DND mode"" issue and wanted to test it now that it was reportedly fixed. Technically, the app crashing means calls are silent in DND mode, so I no longer have that problem... but I have this problem now instead.  ### Screenshots None.   ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.50.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/73c7d619d4dfb3179c8caba9f1648e81236eaebc035fbd11d9400f08878fa8e8","closed","","rosejasperfox","2019-11-23T05:22:05Z","2019-12-04T05:22:03Z"

This is a reproducible and consisted outcome. All pictures taken in the dark are severely affected, and thus pretty useless.  ### Steps to reproduce - Turn on flash on either automatic or always on. - Take a picture in a completely dark room with a lot of white objects or with white walls  **Actual result:** The flashlight turns on to start focusing and to show a preview. Initially the preview seems overexposed, but in less than a second the preview is adjusted and the picture looks good. The flashlight now turns off, and than on again to take the actual picture. This time however the camera starts all over again, but the picture is taken before the adjustment takes place. The result is an overexposed image, while the preview looked just fine. **Expected result:** Signal should remember the adjustment made for the preview and immediately apply them when taking the picture.   I can imagine there are some API calls involved, but the preview proofs a good picture should be perfectly possible if the timing is different or if the camera configuration is preserved crossing that dark moment.  I also wonder why the light stays on so long.  ### Screen captures Following below is the resulting camera image Signal sends to my contacts ![The resulting camera image Signal sends to my contacts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/67626966-d0c42400-f853-11e9-9e40-4f1e201c826c.png)  Following below is a screen capture of the preview taken when the camera was in the process of taking a picture.

Flash light during capture of photo is not working in none of the three modes.   ### Steps to reproduce - open signal app - tap on the camera icon on the lower right side of my shown contacts (main screen).  - take a photo in a dark environment (tap on the circular button on the lower center of the screen) when the flash icon (a flash symbol) on the upper right side of the screen is in always-on mode (filled) or automatic (has a small A besides the flash icon).    **Actual result:** A dark picture is taken. Without use of the flash light.  **Expected result:** The flash light should lighten the scene, it should flash when taking a picture in a dark ambient when in automatic flash mode or should always flash when in always-on-mode.   ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S9 SM-G960F (but I've asked friends, and with the Galaxy S7 and an IPhone it doesn't work neither)  **Android version:** 9 **Kernel version:** 4.9.59 **Signal version:** 4.49.13  ### Link to debug log In the debug log I can't find any hints on my tapping of the flash icon, which I used to change from always-on to automatic flash mode.   https://debuglogs.org/7739563513cd3a4371c4261d105d1c8d2b08e8c405679b6b59892ca97de40fba    ### Related old bug descriptions - #3590 - https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/81ty85/camera_flash_not_working/","closed","acknowledged,","erik55","2019-11-03T10:51:19Z","2022-08-03T12:41:23Z"

In other words, the notification due to unread messages (from non-muted conversations/groups) again pops up and causes a sound/vibration, everytime Signal receives a new message, even though the new message is to a muted conversation/group.  That's particularly annoying if you're in large and noisy groups, muted on purpose but then your phone still keeps vibrating just because you have other unread messages left.  ### Steps to reproduce - Mute a conversation/group - Receive message in non-muted conversation/group, keep it unread - Receive message in muted converstion/group - Watch the notification popping up and your phone vibrating  **Expected result:** Messages to muted conversations/groups should not cause a notification whatsoever  ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi MI A2 Lite **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.48.12  ### Link to debug log It happened plenty of times in the timespan of the following debug log: https://debuglogs.org/905592d53c6c64f9e94fa64dac4c07f4870e624c4543aca9487a8e10d2aad71fManufacturer","closed","wontfix,","mejo-","2019-10-04T15:00:52Z","2022-02-03T19:52:09Z"
"","8710","When receiving multiple videos not all can be played from rail.","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description When I receive multiple video's and I press one video from the received album this video is played. In that screen it also lists the other video's I received. When I press an other video in that list the list itself drops to the bottom of the screen so there are no video controls anymore (play, forward etc) and the video is not played. This does not happen with all video's though. The only option to play the other video's is to go back to the conversation screen and then from the album select the other video. By doing so I can play that video but then again from the rail I can't play the other ones. Below are some screenshots of what happens. First screenshot shows the situation when a video is selected from the album in the conversation view. The video plays correctly. The second screenshot shows when I selected a video from the rail. As can be seen the video control options are gone (and the video doesn't play) One other thing that can be seen is that the previews of the videos in the rail are all empty. I think this is device specific and related to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5993. Perhaps this is the source of the problem and displaying the default video image if no preview can be generated solves it. That's just my guess though.  ### Steps to reproduce - receive multiple videos - open a video from the album - try to play an other video from the video rail (not reproducible with all videos)  **Actual result:** As described. With some videos the video controls are not displayed and the video doesn't play **Expected result:** All videos can be played from the video rail.  ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_1stvideo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25846829/54918856-98481a80-4eff-11e9-9844-4379c633afba.png) ![Screenshot_2ndVideo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25846829/54918875-a5650980-4eff-11e9-9d99-848602f409b7.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung SM-G900F **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.36.2  ### Link to debug log  Started around 11:17.

It's just a hunch, but I think this has something to do with a related glitch where if one sends a message in a large group (let's say 50 people to be safe), and then one inspects the message details, the list of recipients populates but then rearranges for several seconds in seemingly random order (which smells like a race condition of some kind).  ### Steps to reproduce - Join a signal group with at least 50 members - have people send a few messages - close the app - open it again - open the group chat - attempt to type  **Actual result:** The keyboard glitches out (misregisters key presses, input lags) for up to 20 seconds **Expected result:** there should be no glitch.  ### Screenshots [No screenshots available]   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.31.6  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/dae386315ff9feb2d21e0a75bfbfe3606431e7d891124edf92fc413cf97096ea","closed","wontfix,","maximumultraist","2018-12-14T08:59:48Z","2022-02-04T16:16:59Z"

This is the wrong number! Also only the number shows up, not their name or profile photo. However, if I add them from the `(+)` button to the right of the text field, the number is correct and their name and profile photo show up.  This has caused me to send messages to a group that doesn't actually include all the recipients it should have.  ### Steps to reproduce - touch ... button on upper right of main signal screen - touch `New group` - leave the group name blank - touch the text field labeled `Add members` - type enough of the name of your contact (who is in Signal) for it to show up above or below - tap the selected contact  **Actual result:** a number of the form `+13xxxyyyyyyy` shows up below, without a profile picture or name. **Expected result:** the contact's correct number `+1xxxyyyyyyy` accompanied with their profile picture and name.  ### Screenshots TODO    ### Device info **Device:** One Plus 3T **Android version:** 7.1.2 (LineageOS 14.1) **Signal version:** 4.45.2  ### Link to debug log Not sure if I need this.","closed","wontfix,","AaronM04","2019-08-13T19:12:20Z","2022-02-03T23:41:05Z"

Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, I am unable to create a backup on my Sony Xperia Z5 Compact running Android version 7.1.1 - when I press ‘Create backup’ nothing happens. This is despite the fact that I have enabled ‘Chat backups’, ensured the necessary permissions for Signal are enabled, ensured there is enough space to create a backup on the device, and I do not have an SD card in my device. Of course this is very frustrating as I would like to transfer my messages to my new phone so I can begin to use it. I have contacted the official email support but have not had a response yet. I would be very grateful for your help.  ### Steps to reproduce - open Signal and settings - enable chat backups - try to create backup by pressing 'Create backup'   **Actual result:**  Nothing happens after running the steps above except that a Signal notification symbol very briefly appears in the notification panel at the top of the screen for a few milliseconds or so and then disappears. **Expected result:**  I'm not exactly sure what the expected behaviour should be but I imagine a backup should be created somehow.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia Z5 Compact **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.47.7  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/ec45c190c0874f8987621635d0026ec522625f65d2007196fb14bdf41eeade71","closed","backup,","oXvTV","2019-10-08T16:11:55Z","2020-04-22T20:28:51Z"

Calling somebody and being called still works, but when the call is accepted, you hear nothing on both ends. Recording an audio message results in empty audio tracks being sent. Even at playback of received audio messages, the signal stays completely silent.  It seems like Signal doesn't have access to microphone and speakers anymore. I double-checked the permissions for Signal App and it shows microphone permissions as checked. Also, I removed and re-installed Signal from the phone, which didn't change anything.  Normal audio calls and recording in a dedicated recording app keep working, so I doubt that it is related to the device.  My guess is that this is due to some change in a recent Signal version. This issue suddenlty started 2-3 days ago and I had at least two subsequent Signal updates in a row the last few days. I cannot say for certain, which Signal update introduced the problem though.  ### Steps to reproduce - Call somebody, send or receive an audio message - Try (and fail) to speak and/or hear something  **Actual result:** I don't hear anything when on a call or playing an audio message. The other party doesn't hear anything when on a call with me or playing an audio message  **Expected result:** Signal should record my voice and playback the others party voice  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola MotoG3 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.52.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/2a401d6eea307c79e2251238e37d98a5cd05220409d638423a00a06bba35fc08","closed","","mejo-","2019-12-22T16:20:17Z","2019-12-22T19:25:57Z"

However, despite all the discussion and points made in favor of fixing the problem, all of these issues were closed without any indication of a fix or of why they were closed without a fix. And as was pointed out in those other issues, without basic functions like this working similarly to standard text messaging apps, it makes it a lot harder to get people to switch over. And it's frustrating when it wastes time by looking for a GIF only to have it not work. In addition to the fact the size limits should be raised to correspond with those of the carriers, there really should be no limit (or it should be quite high) when sending to another Signal user, since it uses the data connection and shouldn't be subject to carrier SMS/MMS size limitations.","closed","wontfix,","vertigo220","2019-09-25T21:23:04Z","2022-02-04T11:03:28Z"

I sent a message to A. The message was added to the chat, along with an exclamation mark icon and ""Send failed, tap for unsecured fallback"" text. I tapped the message and got a dialog asking ""Fallback to unencrypted SMS? This message will not be encrypted because the recipient is no longer a Signal user. Send unsecured message? Yes/No"". I tapped ""no"". The text changed to ""Send failed, tap for details"".  I tried to send a message to another Signal contact (contact B) and it got sent to the server (one tick). It looks like B uninstalled Signal because it's been a long time all my messages are not delivered to B, so I cannot confirm it fully works.  I tried to delete the ""failed to send"" message to A and send it again two times and got the same error each time. I contacted A through another channel and it turns out A got all my messages that appeared as ""failed to send"" to me. What's more, A tried to send me a last message yesterday that failed to send (without the ""Fallback to unencrypted SMS"") and I didn't receive it. A cannot send me any messages now because I appear as if I'm not registered on Signal (""enable signal for SMS"" button instead of text field).  I tried to send myself a message from my phone but I disappeared from the list of contacts on Signal. Contact A is still on the list though.  I tried to send myself a message from Signal desktop, and it failed to send. I tried to send a message to B from Signal desktop, and it shows as sent to the server, but it doesn't show up on my phone.  ### Steps to reproduce - Try to send a message to my contact A  **Actual result:** The message appears as failed to sent even though it is actually sent, and A cannot reply to me because I appear as not on Signal. **Expected result:** The message is sent and A can reply to me.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung GT-N7100 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.33.5  ### Link to debug log [Debug log from my phone](https://debuglogs.org/871180570f04fe49f286e3c29a8f8beec3243782c6245693c19d6de89c29ed01).

That's particularly problematic if you change the settings for disappearing messages in a group and the message that indicates this change isn't delivered to some contact from that group because the security number has changed. In this case Signal shows an error indicator (red exlamation mark next to the message), as the changed setting hasn't been delivered to the contact with changed security number. But there's no way to view details about which contact is the problematic one or to even acknowledge changed security number and resend the number.  ### Steps to reproduce - create a signal group - ask one of the members to reinstall signal or change their security number by other means - don't acknowledge the changed security number in advance - change the disappearing messages settings in the group - wait for the error sign to appear  **Actual result:** It's impossible to view details for those special ""system messages"" like those that inform about changed disappearing messages settings. **Expected result:** It should be possible to view the message details even for those messages (like it's in the deskop app).  ### Screenshots **![signal-disappearing-messages-failed cleaned](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3582805/50426239-1bb68900-0889-11e9-9911-08bdbc51666f.png)  ### Device info **Device:** HTC One M9 **Android version:** 7.1.2 (LineageOS without GApps) **Signal version:** 4.31.6","closed","wontfix,","mejo-","2018-12-25T20:14:20Z","2022-02-04T11:03:18Z"

Remembering the issue from the group chat the iOS user removed the profile picture and they can now chat without any issues.  ### Steps to reproduce - as mentioned above in one case removing the profile picture fixed the problem for issue 1 - I can not recreate issue 1 on a oneplus 5T with the website build of Signal (no google play)  ### Device info **Device:** Various **Android version:** Various **Signal version: 4.42.3  ### Link to debug log This log seems to point to RetrieveProfileAvatarJob possibly having an issue? https://pastebin.com/raw/9MtvYaZW  More debugging info to come.","closed","","3WfMeCuUqzgXBh","2019-07-02T06:36:33Z","2019-11-09T00:26:32Z"

Depending on the nature of the call, it might be noticeable fast, or only later. Delay develops faster in videocalls than voice calls, and also across continents (US, europe) it comes in faster than within europe (inside Austria). I am not quite sure whether I encountered it really within the one country. The magnitude is hard to measure, especially since it is usually not noticed until it is rather big, but it can amount to a few minutes after an hour of calling, in a voice call. in a videocall, things can become much delayed after a few minutes.  It is not a latency which has a static magnitude, but builds up, terminating and reopening a connection solves the problem just fine, it starts at 0.  My guess would be that it is device dependet, possibly on the CPU/GPU: Usually, when we notice that the video is quite delayed, switching back to audio only also helps. In this case, one recipient might get all that he missed until then in sort of a 'fast-forward' manner, too fast to coherently follow, but still somehow intelligible, depending on the magnitude of what had already developed.   ### Steps to reproduce Make a signal call, may be video or voice (faster noticable in video call) **Actual result:** After some time, considerable delay builds up, it may take a few minutes for one party to hear what the other party has said (and vice versa), however, all that is being said is transmitted, and there is now apparent slowdown noticeable in the talking of a person.   **Expected result:** no delay, sound and video are transmitted in near real-time, with some occuring latency below one second, comparable to a normal phone call  **accurately measuring it:** I do not have the time/means to do sth like this, but I can imagine one could set up a call, and a metronome on one side, or some slow frequency stuff, and see whether the frequency is exactly the same on the other side, and how much they differ/run away from each other. in the end it is a small frequency shift, which destroys coherence over time.   ### Device info Party 1: **Device:** Sony Xperia Z4/Z3+ (E6533) **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.47.7  Party 2 **Device:** Galaxy A7 (2018) - model number: AM-A750 FN/DS **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.47.7  ### Link to debug log Party 1: https://debuglogs.org/13cab77bc52f19b9c560b38dbeb39dc0b77ae0fe116356326e893ae5b1452b9e  Party 2: https://debuglogs.org/c7db09c180a8dfa87eb809a1df1f691c8e9e6240f50c35abd566139bd74cfea9  One respective videocall happens at approximately GMT+1 23:36  (immediately start with call, timezone of party 1) on 2019-10-13, the delay amounted in the end to a few minutes, (1-4 min, bad estimate)","closed","wontfix,","bklebel","2019-10-16T17:12:29Z","2022-02-03T09:09:06Z"

Some contacts do not show in Signal (like they do in other messaging apps, or in the Contacts app).  The missing contacts are seemingly random and are not Signal contacts - just standard contacts with a phone number to message via SMS/MMS.  If you search for these contacts in Signal, they are not found.  If you start a message and just type in their number manually, then send the message, they show up in the conversations list as their name (as in, the app matches their number to a name, proving that it does have Contacts permissions.  Toggling the Contacts permission off/on does nothing to fix this.  Refreshing the contacts list in Signal does nothing to fix this.  Uninstalling/reinstalling Signal does nothing to fix this.  ### Steps to reproduce - Locate contact that is missing in the contact list - Start a message to this person by phone number directly - See the person listed by name in the conversations list - Notice the person is STILL not listed in the contact list, even though you've just proven Signal can match name to number successfully  **Actual result:** Contact is missing **Expected result:** Contact is present  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Note 9 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.34.8  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/0c4daed3696621100d363c997a042c79a04009bc47cc6a643d1bc4bbf1fca04a","closed","","sybercorp","2019-02-25T21:33:23Z","2022-05-03T15:00:48Z"

Clicking the blue '+' button on the right of the text box (outside it) and then selecting 'Camera' opens the system camera app, which always auto-rotates.  ### Steps to reproduce - In a Signal conversation view, click the Camera button in the right side of the text input box - Rotate the phone physically, with or without the system auto-rotation setting enabled  **Actual result:** Camera should always auto-rotate **Expected result:** Camera only auto-rotates when system-wide auto-rotation is enabled  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S9 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.31.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/9cf5fc892fd29d65fc215a11f85b951c645d1517203cbc933574e5ef84a46861","closed","","subraizada3","2019-01-08T03:19:16Z","2019-03-19T18:07:01Z"

Signal Desktop behaves differently and doesn't show the images in the gallery.  As quickly discussed in the forum (https://community.signalusers.org/t/link-preview-when-pasting-or-typing-links/2370/72), this seems probably to be unintended behavior.  ### Steps to reproduce - Enable link previews - Share link, e.g. to YouTube - Go to ""Shared media""  **Actual result:** The images for the link previews show up in the gallery. **Expected result:** Personal preference: Images don't show up. In any case, it should be consistent with Signal Desktop.  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 8.1 **Signal version:** 4.33.5  ### Link to debug log If necessary, I will add the debug log.","closed","wontfix,","minnmann","2019-02-08T13:43:39Z","2022-04-06T07:37:49Z"

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. > >The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

What's weird is that issue #8987 mentions that the reason for this removal is that it's hard to remove previous backups when signal is uninstalled.  I'd argue that if you intentionally select an external SD card as a backup location, signal should *not even attempt* to remove it's backups during app removal (why would it do so?!). I rotate SD cards for backup purposes, I'd would be very surprised if a backup would be removed on app removal.  Please re-introduce backups to external SD media.

Thus it's not distinguishable from the new message notification, e.g. on the lock screen, if notification contents are hidden.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a larger media message  **Actual result:** The ""Uploading media"" notification has the default Signal icon. **Expected result:** The ""Uploading media"" notification has a special icon, like all other ""non-new-message"" notifications, like the fetching message notification.  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20190916-205343](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22525368/65721108-b60e5c00-e0a9-11e9-9643-4d0c89d52c77.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus X **Android version:** 7 **Signal version:** 4.47.6  ### Link to debug log UI issue","closed","wontfix,","mueller-ma","2019-09-26T20:08:19Z","2022-04-12T19:48:46Z"

So far so good.  - Leave the settings but stay within the app. - Enter a group conversation and read some messages, no need to write any - Now leave the conversation by going back to the conversation list. - Open settings and navigate to language - Switch the language back to default  - The app is still English! This is odd. - I switch to Dutch - The app is now in Dutch, I did not have to restart the app. - I switch back to default. - The app is now in English. Why?! My system default is Dutch. The app should be Dutch at this point. - With the setting still on default, I restart the app. The app is now in Dutch.  **Important notice!** If you don't leave settings before switching back to 'default', the bug does not occur, and the language does switch as expected. Only if you leave the setting and come back to them, does the language setting fail to apply on the next attempt. I have been able to reproduce this bug on my device, but since I don't know exactly  what triggers it, I don't know if I will continue to be able to reproduce it when I advance my conversations. Please let me know whether you have been able to reproduce this!  **Expected result:** I expect the app language to immediately switch back to system default when I select default in the language menu. It is counter intuitive that switching to some options is applied immediately, but switching back to default takes a restart to take effect. This causes confusion.  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 9 (9.0?) **Signal version:** 4.35.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/e07774d4e69b0e5244d44bd01c6855c9dc0b97f099cb919897f1418e183d3b93","closed","","Meteor0id","2019-03-09T15:18:55Z","2019-05-01T22:34:19Z"

"","8595","Android 9 no notifications despite being fully enabled","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Specifically on the PIXEL 2 XL device with standard AOSP firmware (Android 9/Pie).  At first just the Signal Messenger (encrypted messages) notifications would not work and messages actually would not come to Signal unless I opened it (suspect background service issue).  Recently in the last couple weeks or so, my device would not receive text messages at all (suspected carrier issue).  Got that to reset by removing Signal as default and then coming back to it from Messenger (stock messenger, not Facebook).  Now, as of the last week or so regardless of the type of message I am getting no notifications at all despite the Signal application having full notifications access.  Any ideas?  Everything worked fine on the same device when it was on Android 8.1 (Oreo).  ### Steps to reproduce - Having a Pixel 2 XL with AOSP Android 9.0     ### Device info Google/LG Pixel 2 XL Android 9.0 Signal Version latest release channel as of this post (loaded Beta signal to test further as of now).  ### Link to debug log Suspect this is an issue related to Android 9.0 and how Signal integrates.  The application works as expected other than no private messages coming in when it is not foreground and no audible or visual notifications posted to OS notifications.","closed","","ctradio-james","2019-02-07T16:09:50Z","2019-10-07T13:59:30Z"

If I recieve a message while signal is in the backround (still having an unfinished message draft in signal) the draft is lost when I resume signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - open signal - open a chat - start typing a message (dont send) - switch to another app - recieve a message in the chat with the message draft - switch back to signal **Actual result:** The message draft is lost.

Once hitting ""Send"" on the one, it closes and reveals the second editor dialog of the same image. If I hit ""Send"" again, it *appears* two send the image twice. However, closing the second dialog often causes no message to be sent at all.  I've been attempting to reliably reproduce this over the past 2 days, but it happens seemingly randomly. It *seems* like it happens more often when the app hasn't been in use for a while (30min), but that's a total hunch.  ### Steps to reproduce - Take a picture in Google Camera - Open the image - Press the Share Button - Select Signal - In the Editor, enter a message with it - Hit ""Send""  **Actual result:** A second, duplicate dialog is revealed. The text entered is absent, indicating it's a separate dialog. Pressing send again causes two images to appear in the chat. **Expected result:** The user is returned to the chat with a single image being sent.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** 10 -- Build QP1a.191105.003 **Signal version:** 4.49.18  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/20f972e6ba6f8ae7f9b6396b9719ee6ed1a78c7252a30f46e2aa32e7859eab62  For easier analyzing, the image in question is `MVIMG_20191112_153409.jpg`  Note, I deleted the second message immediately after I saw it while it was still uploading. Not sure how that impacts the result.","closed","wontfix,","kevinmirsky","2019-11-12T20:58:13Z","2022-02-02T17:36:21Z"

This issues persists after an upgrade to 4.34.8 too.  The Signal app has been used on the device for years prior. Same device no changes.  ### Steps to reproduce #### For crash while scrolling GIFs - Open Signal - Select a contact from conversation list - Press the (+) icon next to message input box - Press the GIF icon - Scroll the list of GIFs really fast (scrolling slowly will eventually result in same outcome after 3-4 pages)  **Actual result:**   - The list of GIFs begins to scroll rapidly as expected then, Signal crashes and the ""Unfortunately, Signal has stopped."" message is displayed   - NOTE: Signal does not always crash with the message, sometimes the GIF Activity and keyboard simply disappears and we are dumped back to the conversation screen  **Expected result:**    - The list of GIFs scroll rapidly then slows down and stops scrolling   #### For crash while searching GIFs - Open Signal - Select a contact from conversation list - Press the (+) icon next to message input box - Press the GIF icon - Touch the GIF search box to bring up the keyboard - Try typing ""hello world"" or just try entering a (lengthy?) search string   **Actual result:**   - At some point Signal crashes and the ""Unfortunately, Signal has stopped."" message is displayed   - NOTE: Signal does not always crash with the message, sometimes the GIF Activity and keyboard simply disappears and we are dumped back to the conversation screen  **Expected result:**   - The list of GIFs are filtered to match the entered search term(s)  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G xt1033 **Android version:** 4.4.4 **Signal version:** 4.34.8, 4.33.5  ### Link to debug log [For crash while SCROLLING](https://debuglogs.org/0f2573b2b1b8f21534ae9ad240cce230a5250e74613e573c4c87334a8f8ae78f)","closed","wontfix,","BugScribe","2019-04-19T23:13:03Z","2022-02-04T13:14:20Z"

Please find below, one such adventure.   ### Steps to reproduce -  first, be having a signal4desktop#A conversation with another person on signal4desktop#B which is linked to their android#B  -  second, decide that our textual-conversation will go more smoothly if we can cryptocall on speakerphone whilst we simultaneously continue typing on our signal4desktop instances  -  third, connect android#A to the internet, after roughly 48 hours of being in airplane-mode ... with intent to make that cryptocall firmly in mind.   -  all throughout this saga (outlined below), android#A is dinging&buzzing as it tries to catch up on old news (signal4desktop conversation it missed because of airplane-mode)     gory details     -  attempted to initiate cryptocall ~~14:21 from android#A to android#B , carefully dodging the constant popups by tapping the call-icon at just the right moment  -  attempted call 14:22 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  attempted call 14:22 from A to B -  attempted call 14:23 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  comment by A:  dialing, but never makes it to ringing (sent from desktop#A and received by android#A)  -  attempted call 14:25 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  B presses hangup, but android#A does not figure that out -  attempted call 14:25 from A to B, but what appears on A is the **incoming** call screen ... no audible ringing ... says 'INCOMING CALL' in the cyan middle-bar ... swipe-up does not work (B already hung up)  -  attempted call 14:28 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  attempted call 14:28 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  attempted call 14:28 from A to B -  first Bad Encrypted Message appears on A, dated sunday 11:43 , then 3 successes stamped 11:44, then another BEM at 11:44, +8 good, 1 BEM, 1 good, 1 BEM, 5 good, 1 BEM, and so on like that.  BEM are always the incoming ones (from signal4desktop#B running windows to just-catching-up android#A device which has been offline), outgoing messages from signal4desktop#A do not appear as BEM on android#A that I could tell.   -  attempted call 14:30 from A to B ... android#B sees the incoming-call screen, and can attempt to swipe-up / swipe-down the button, but ""nothing happens when I try"" to do those actions ... android#A meanwhile always displays 'DIALING' never ringing  -  at this point every message that android#A receives during the sync-and-download attempt begins showing as BEM ... wall-time is 14:31 monday, but android#A is still working on sunday 11:54 stamped chat-bubbles.  after roughly ~150 BEM in a row (dinging android#A once every couple of seconds despite me having signalapp open to the chat in question), over the course of ~3 mins wall-clock elapsed, android#A gets to sunday 13:07 stamped messages.   -  sent some text-messages from android#A for the first time, at 14:34, which did not work properly ... shows double-unfilled-checkmarks on android#A (i.e. delivered no read-receipt ever properly processed) whereas over on desktop#A shows double-FILLED-checkmarks (i.e. the sync worked and the message went out to android#B plus desktop#B and one or both of them sent the read-receipt which desktop#A received and properly processed)  -  attempted call 14:35 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  attempted call 14:35 from B to A, shows as ""missed call"" on A -  after waiting another couple minutes, as of 14:36 android#A was still throwing BEM from message-traffic the previous day  -  after another five minutes of steady monotonous ding&buzz BEM BEM BEM, decided to try and reset encrypted session on android#A at 14:41   -  enduser of android#B and desktop#B reported that **no** error messages of any sort were appearing on their devices, all during the preceding twenty minutes of cryptocall-attempts ... desktop#A was also unaware of any problems at the time  -  this did not work... and I believe, but am not positive, that after session-reset *zero* error-messages appeared for the enduser with android#B and desktop#B ... they did see the session-reset alert, though.   -  android#A continued to popup, ding, buzz, and BEM every second much like before... desktop#A continued to be oblivious and able to exchange text-messages with desktop#B plus android#B with no discernable delays  -  android#A threw a couple of ""messge encrypted for non-existent session"" errors shortly after it noticed the session had been reset, then went back to ""Bad encrypted message"" almost immediately ... probably 350 in a row?  -  three of the incoming messages to android#A, near the end of that long string of BEM ding&buzz events, were timestamped Monday 14:41 and 14:42 ... though I believe they did not RENDER at that wall-clock time  :-)   -  finally, with timestamp 14:50 for all three, signal4desktop#A displayed three error-messages in their individual chat-bubbles in a row:  Error handling incoming message ... message-details on the first of the three:  Bad MAC. Sent Monday, March 4, 2019 2:50 PM (1551732630655).  Received Monday, March 4, 2019 2:50 PM (1551732633979).  sender:  enduser#B.  sealedSender:  enabled.   -  at some point around now, closed signal4desktop#A and re-launched it, plus powered off signal4android#A ... which kept dinging even from the OS-is-shutting-down-animation-screen... then re-powered-up android#A.  may have also reset the session a second time, around 14:50, methinks?   -  There were another couple dozen BEMs, between 14:50 and 14:57, interspersed with ""successful"" messages from desktop#A or from desktop#B at unpredictable points in wall-clock time  -  after a **bit** more waiting around, by 14:57 android#A was finally somewhat back to normal.   -  cryptocall from A to B, was 'DIALLING' for less than two seconds, then 'RINGING' for less than two seconds.  spoke briefly, hung up, captured four debuglogs -  cryptocall from A to B again at 15:00 worked just fine as well.           **Actual result:**   *  total downtime was 40 minutes *  this was android#A attempting to sync roughly 48 hours of chat-history, on the order of 400 to 600 chat-messages, while on wifi *  aka throughput of around one message every five seconds roughly.    **Expected result:**   *  the expected behavior, is that signal4android needs to hurry up and help me accomplish what I want, which is to be able to make a cryptocall or send an encrypted message or whatever  *  it can tell, by contacting signal4desktop, that all the messages is it about to download, are things that I've already viewed on another device linked to it  *  so the key is therefore to achieve a high-performance pre-processing phase, where that big old somewhat-pointless download can double-ratchet along *quickly* to the point where signal4android is useful/usable ASAP     optimization advice     *  android#A needs to open a websocket to signal-server.   *  android#A needs to download every single message in a stream of packets, quickly and without needless roundtrips and without interruption, emptying the delivery-queue like it was a streaming-video containing 500 movie-frames, and NOT like it was 500 little individual files that each required their own HTTP request and their own HTTP response with pauses for processing before and after each network-operation  *  android#A needs to decrypt the minimum possible from those streaming-downloads, so as to strip off the sealed-sender protections and figure out which chat-history each new message-bubble goes in, and the metadata-timestamp *  android#A should not perform ANY notification-popups during this entire process:  no ding, no vibrate, no screen-pop  *  android#A should not perform ANY disk-writes during this process, unless physical RAM is so limited that it needs to dump some of the incoming stream of bytes to an (encrypted) binary scratchfile temporarily  *  android#A should not perform any unnecessary SQLCipher queries (especially not write-queries) during this entire process.   *  android#A has the goal of getting to where it is operational again, and the enduser can make a cryptocall or send a crypto-text, which is WHY the enduser just opened it up, after all  *  android#A should defer everything that can be deferred, to get to that point in time.   *  there should be no messing around with read-receipts, is-typing, generating sync-messages to send out to other linked-devices, pulling attachments from S3, uploading addressbook-info, checking whether anybody has altered their signal-profile-avatar, checking whether any old disappearing-messages have gone past their expiration-date and need secure_delete, ANYTHING but the priority of churning through the delivery-queue as quickly as possible so as to be able to **live in the now**  ;-)   *  android#A is *then* free, only then, in the background and without interrupting the enduser's ongoing activity (making a cryptocall or sending textual messages or whatever), to begin rendering message-bodies into the correct on-screen locations, begin storing fully-decrypted stuff into SQLCipher locally-encrypted, and generally getting all the eventually-needs-to-be-done things accomplished, which were brutally skipped during the get-to-operational pre-processing phase outlined above.   *  android#A will, as part of the post-processing effort, eventually get to the point where it is fully up to date and completely synchronized and has no partly-decrypted envelopes and scratchfiles and other such things laying around.   *  this entire approach is considerably more complex than the current approach, which assumes that nobody will ever leave their phone offline for 48 hours and nobody will ever receive 480 messages in that timespan *  but the advantage to this approach, is that instead of processing messages at the rate of one every five seconds on average, it ought to be possible to pre-process messages at the rate of *five per second*, without even trying very hard to optimize anything, just merely avoiding stalling the download-pipeline, avoiding disk-writes that must be flushed before anything can continue, and avoiding CPU cycles which can be deferred until later for the lazy-compute background post-processing phase.          *  Therefore, instead of it taking FORTY minutes to get operational, dinging and buzzing every second along the way, it might only take 90 seconds to get operational... with a progress-bar and an ETA of ""pre-processing #100 of 480 messages"" ... and in blissful silence  *  At the end of the pre-processing phase, there can be **one** ding and **one** notification-popup:  ""you have 456 new messages in 23 conversations""   ### Screenshots  Imagine seventeen android-display screenfuls of [Bad encrypted message] in a row.  Wish that I was kidding  :-)   Besides in the 1-on-1 chat where I was most active during that 48-hour timespan, there was also a large number -- many dozen -- BEM chat-bubbles in the NoteToSelf on android#A, which I have never actually used.  Unclear why.  Both the 1-on-1 chat and the NoteToSelf are working fine now.    ### Device info  **Device:** Alcatel A574BL **Android version:** 7.1.1  **Signal version:** 4.34.8   ### Link to debug logs   *  android#A == https://debuglogs.org/cb4e503f1fbb6cfd85735b8c33c7d261cb9cac6c59c4ae6f2d927ab97bf7198b *  desktop#A == https://debuglogs.org/9f25d474f228ec3ebfe32982288057becdbeb226a3e531b820c0a71350cd473e *  desktop#B == https://debuglogs.org/3c73cbe93c6d91792be32c0665698606ef80aebb564a7b671a3ee7ef2d94c8fd *  android#B == https://debuglogs.org/be9e208b7534761e2fc45472e704d2e44a2cde67e8094fe106d839954eab80d4  Unfortunately, the vast outpouring of BEM and friends, almost certainly means that the root cause of the trouble cannot be traced, because the debuglogs are empty of the portion of the 40-minute timespan that would have potentially revealed what went wrong.  However, possibly by correlating desktop#A with android#A logfiles, it will become clear what occurred in the early phases of android#A's difficulties.  Note that the chat-bubble ordering of android#A is *completely* out of whack (messages from the three days all getting interspersed and intermixed) but that desktop#A was powered-on and internet-connected at all times so it has a properly-ordered transcript of message-bodies for the most part.   ### Potentially related   * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7465#issuecomment-378147544 , Bad old messages after database upgrade  * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/3061 , desktop Spams Contacts After Not Being Used for Over A Month * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/3050 , desktop sends message with text ""Bad encrypted message"" multiple times to contacts * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/1751 , Messages sent from desktop appear as a 'Bad encrypted message' in mobile * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2912 , Error Handling Incoming Message - Bad MAC  * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7154 , Bad encrypted message from myself [however, this was long before Note To Self ... note that I had used the unofficial dial-my-own number trick before, but never utilized the official new NoteToSelf feature yet on android#A ... so why it was getting BEM in that is mysterious to me, perhaps those are sync-messages from desktop#A being misinterpreted as NoteToSelf?]  * et cetera","closed","wontfix,","five-c-d","2019-03-06T03:28:39Z","2022-02-04T11:03:16Z"

This happened with no apparent cause. The only thing I could see that happened at the time was that I received a lot of messages from a group chat (I saw it later on a paired computer which still works). This behaviour stays even after reboot, forcing the app to close or clearing the cache.  ### Steps to reproduce - tap the app icon to start Signal  **Actual result:** The screen flashes white briefly.

When deactivating a SIM card in Android, in a dual-SIM phone, even the options to select which SIM card should be used by default for some operations are greyed out, as there is only one SIM available. However, Signal is not handling that well as keeping the deactivated SIM cards available for selection. Even worse, you can send messages with that SIM card, which obviously won't work, but end-up in a loop of authorization messages as detailed in #8017. Issues such as #7167 were requesting for Signal to consider Android's configuration for the SIM card to use by default, and I think my current issue would be solved by that approach too. I've also seen that #6664 seem to have reported a similar issue, but nothing was done about it.  ### Steps to reproduce - switch off the SIM card selected to send messages in Signal on a dual SIM phone - send something  **Actual result:** Tries to send the message (in what seems an infinite loop) using the deactivated SIM card **Expected result:** Automatically (or maybe alterting with a dialog before) switch to the enabled SIM card (or error without the infinite loop saying the SIM card is not available?)  ### Device info **Device:** OnePLus 6T **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.30.8","closed","Multi-SIM,","XaF","2018-12-04T19:36:49Z","2019-05-21T13:54:49Z"

I guess Android had a hiccup of some sorts and requires to be rebooted... I appreciate that this is a tough environment to work in.

I hope that there's a better way than crashing (and taking Android down).","closed","","muelli","2019-10-10T10:51:42Z","2019-10-24T11:34:51Z"
"","8781","Signal crashes when opening app","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Signal immediately crashes when trying to open.  It was working normally earlier today. Looking at the messages from the desktop app, I sent a message to someone at 12:59 PDT from my phone, they sent a message to me at 13:02 PDT that I received on my phone. They then sent another message to me at 13:02 PDT that I didn't receive on my phone (and a few more after that). Around 17:00 PDT, I noticed the app on my phone wouldn't open anymore.  ### Steps to reproduce - Press the Signal app  **Actual result:** Signal crashes, flashes a report dialog, then dismisses it. **Expected result:** Signal opens, and I can use it.  ### Screenshots   ![signal_crash_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1356417/56707586-5660ee80-66ce-11e9-9b46-3a6e4c30d156.gif)   ### Device info  **Device:** Moto G5 plus **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.37.2  ### Link to debug log   Cannot capture a debug log from the phone as the app doesn't open.  Connecting through `adb` and using `logcat` gives this: ``` 04-24 19:39:02.212 10252 10276 E Database: file is not a database: , while compiling: select count(*) from sqlite_master; 04-24 19:39:02.212 10252 10276 E Database: net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteException: file is not a database: , while compiling: select count(*) from sqlite_master;

"","8345","Signal state gets confused when accepting a picture from iOS ""send to""","- [X] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [X] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [X] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Signal exposes itself as a recipient of ""send to"" capabilities in iOS.  For example, when viewing a picture, you can send it to Signal, where you can select a recipient to send it to.  The problem is that when using this capability, an already-running Signal instance seems to get confused about its state.  Symptoms include:  - Signal doesn't show the picture you just sent  - Signal doesn't show a message you just received   - Signal crashes.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have Signal open, and in a conversation with a contact. - Switch to iOS Photos - Share a picture to Signal, and select the current-conversation recipient - Switch back to Signal - Continue the conversation  **Actual result:**  The picture that you just sent is often not present in the existing conversation.  Continuing the conversation often results in Signal crashing.  **Expected result:**  The picture you sent is there, in the relevant position in the conversation thread.  Continuing the conversation doesn't result in a crash.   ### Device info  **Device:** iPhone 6s **iOS version:** 12.1 **Signal version:** 2.30.2.16","closed","","wdormann","2018-11-07T03:06:48Z","2018-11-07T03:17:29Z"

It's simply not an option.  I disabled the app and installed an open source contacts app (OpenContacts) from F-Droid. However... Signal doesn't recognize it.  ### Steps to reproduce - Download an alternative contacts app. - Find a conversation in Signal with a number not saved to your contacts. - Select ""Add to contacts""  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Nothing happens. No UI, no warning, nothing.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  One or more of the following:  - Signal asks me which default Contacts app I would like to use (if this is possible and the default has not already been selected).  - Signal detects that it can't open the contacts app and presents a list of apps it thinks are compatible (If this is possible).  - Signal allows me to copy the number to my clipboard in the event that it cannot detect or open a contacts app.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.40.4  ### Link to debug log   [Debug Log](https://debuglogs.org/07ff37ea5b1caf4f6a03c390a9f3c642240223af571f98d46c3dc93ffdca117f)","closed","","soulofmischief","2019-06-06T03:46:53Z","2019-06-12T19:26:36Z"

If DNSfilter is enabled on the phone receiving the call, the receiving phone creates a receiving call notification but does not have an audible ring nor does the phone automatically bring up the answer screen. Clicking the call notification brings up the answer screen but answering (by swiping up) does not result in an audio connection. **Expected result:** In either case, a voice call should be established.  ### Screenshots Please ask if you feel they will be useful.  ### Device info Describing the device with DNSfilter enabled:  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S5 **Android version:** LineageOS with MicroG (Nightly Build from November 13, 2019) (Android 9) **Signal version:** 4.49.18 (Website Universal Build)  ### Link to debug log I have attached 2 logs from each phone.

The stacktrace, extracted from the log, is as follows:   java.lang.AssertionError: Not e164: notifications@learnedleague.com 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.Address.toPhoneString(Address.java:134) 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.RetrieveProfileJob.handleIndividualRecipient(RetrieveProfileJob.java:99) 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.RetrieveProfileJob.onRun(RetrieveProfileJob.java:82) 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobs.BaseJob.run(BaseJob.java:20) 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobmanager.JobRunner.run(JobRunner.java:71) 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.jobmanager.JobRunner.run(JobRunner.java:37)  This looks similar to: #6841: Startup crash under 4.9.0 beta with email-to-SMS gateway message #6844: Crash on startup due to ""invalid"" email #8813: Signal crashes when email address entered intophone number  but the stacktrace is a bit different from those. In particular the recent in-flight fix for #8813, https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/7db15885781e20d9adeaaecf22e9e700ff399020, doesn't look like it will cover this case.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive SMS messages that are ""from"" an email address - Pick that sender/message in conversation view - See app crash; attempt to reopen  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) Instant crash, from database.Address.toPhoneString()  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Viewing the conversation  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel **Android version:** 0.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.40.4  ### Link to debug log  From logcat, since I can't get to the app's settings: 06-04 13:13:52.976   919   970 I ActivityManager: Start proc 6764:org.thoughtcrime.securesms/u0a248 for activity org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity 06-04 13:13:53.054  6764  6764 E crime.securesm: Not starting debugger since process cannot load the jdwp agent. 06-04 13:13:53.179  6764  6764 I crime.securesm: The ClassLoaderContext is a special shared library. 06-04 13:13:53.552  6764  6764 I MultiDex: VM with version 2.1.0 has multidex support 06-04 13:13:53.553  6764  6764 I MultiDex: Installing application 06-04 13:13:53.553  6764  6764 I MultiDex: VM has multidex support, MultiDex support library is disabled. 06-04 13:13:53.633  6764  6764 D FirebaseApp: com.google.firebase.auth.FirebaseAuth is not linked.

Faulty hardware AEC is a longstanding issue on the Fairphone 2 (see https://bugtracker.fairphone.com/project/fairphone-android-7/issue/179). Calls did not echo on Signal 4.39 when the FP2 was added to the AEC blacklist, but from Signal 4.40 onwards the echo is back again (no pun intended).   I’ve experienced the echo when calling between two Fairphone 2s on Signal 4.43.8 and many previous versions (except 4.39). When I first experienced the problem both my and my partner's FP2s were running the stock Android 7.1.2 ROM, and echoes were heard on both phones during Signal calls.   Since first experiencing this problem I have installed LineageOS (Android 9) on my FP2, while my partner's FP2 is still on the stock Android 7.1.2 ROM. Now, when I call my partner’s FP2 I hear my own voice echo back to me on my phone but she doesn’t hear her voice echo back on her phone. I think this means that the AEC issue is on her stock Android 7 FP2.  As per the issue on the Fairphone bugtracker, other FP2 users using the stock Android 7 ROM have had the same experience where the echo was gone in Signal 4.39 but has returned as of 4.40 onwards.   ### Steps to reproduce - Make a Signal call with a Fairphone 2 running the stock Android 7 ROM.   **Actual result:** When you make a Signal call with an Android 7 Fairphone 2, echoes are heard throughout the call. **Expected result:** Fairphone 2 Android 7 Signal calls are echo-free.  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.43.8  ### Link to debug log Not sure it’s relevant, but I can provide one if necessary.","closed","wontfix,","sadavat","2019-07-20T18:04:04Z","2022-01-28T05:09:39Z"

"","8445","Android app shows countless notifications rapidly for old messages, already read in the desktop app","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Signal Android receives notifications for messages that have been read on Signal Desktop. Apparently this also happens when both apps are open – but since the message comes to both apps at the same moment, I guess that isn't so weird. Also, I never use both at the same time, so I can't vouch for that. However: when the Android app has been offline for some time while a conversation was continued in the desktop app, all hell breaks loose when the Android app is turned on (connected to the internet). Messages – SEEN messages from the desktop – start coming in, one by one, each with a notification. Well, almost, because they come faster than the notifications are able to catch up. Then, as they keep coming, they are immediately getting ticked as read. But for a few minutes, the phone rings, buzzes, and/or displays a visual notification – depending on the person's settings – unless you completely turn off the notifications prior to turning on the internet connection. This has been an issue for years and remains one, I don't believe this is a feature (certainly not a good one).  It used to be a problem on the desktop too, but it was fixed by making a loading screen. The app isn't usable until the messages are downloaded. This might not be the best way, but I guess it's better than crazy notifications firing five times a second. Maybe something similar could work on the mobile too? Or, if this is possible, maybe allow the user to message immediately, while syncing, starting at the most recent messages, instead of chronologically. That allows the user to get a quick reminder about the last topic, and doesn't keep flashing new messages in the conversation – they would quietly come in the background.   Another idea: get the message, **first** check the read status, and then if it's really a new message, notify. I don't know about coding it, but it sounds simple enough and should fix the whole problem. This comes from an earlier issue where the poster pointed out that the read status appears only after the notification has already sounded.  There could also be only one notification for messages that have already been read on the desktop, and then notifications for messages that are new (first seen now, when looking at the Android app). I even think it might be the case that when I get completely new messages while the Android app is on, there is only one notification per conversation, even if that person sent me more messages. So it should apply even more to already read ones.  Other mentions of, or related to this issue: - in #5519, the original post isn't exactly about this, but [this comment](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5519#issuecomment-269923342) describes exactly this problem. - [#6273](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6273) is about the divider between old and new messages. I haven't had a chance to check how this works (and if), but it sounds like the divider illustrates how the desktop messages are treated as new even though they've been read. - [#6126](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6126) is this exact issue. - in #4905 the poster mentions both apps receiving messages and notifications at the same time when they're both online, but particularly [this reply](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/4905#issuecomment-214060133) is about the problem when coming back from offline state, and mentions the way it should be: ""Can you fix the client to download and process all of the synced states before deciding whether to show any notifications?"" - [#3165](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/3165) is one of the earlier mentions of this, and doesn't explicitly talk about the circumstances, but it's probably the same problem. - in [#5410](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5410) it is pointed out that the issue is a duplicate of very similar ones. But that issue was posted over 2,5 years ago and it's still relevant. Not to mention the earlier issues. - [#5741](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5741) mentions the phone buzzing *while* using the desktop, but it's related. - and finally [#778](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/778), from **February 2014**, which may be the first mention of this problem. It describes the same thing: phone's been off while conversation continued on desktop, phone gets back online, cue many, many notifications. @moxie0 self-assigned also in 2014, no other actions there happened. More happened on #3165 instead (lots of mentions mostly), although there is no asignee or milestones there. Moxie closed that issue with [this commit](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/3787551878473c703a21210aa24d39080ad57ad4) saying that it fixes two other issues, even though it **doesn't** fix the real problem of a LOT of notifications coming after a longer time offline, as opposed to while using the desktop and mobile at the same time.   ### Steps to reproduce - have a conversation in the Android app - close the Android app, turn off the internet connection - continue the conversation in the desktop app (well, perhaps this and the first point not necessary – it doesn't have to be the same conversation, or it could be several) - turn on the internet connection and Android app (if it still receives messages while not active, you don't have to turn it on. But I used to not get messages after *I think* force quitting the app until opening it, so I'm pointing it out)  **Actual result:** The Android app displays and sounds tens of notifications, getting every single message as if it were a new one, only later marking it as read. **Expected result:** The messages that have already been read on the desktop app should be synced quietly and in the background, as they are already part of the conversation. If there are any new, unread messages, they can get a notification, either first (if syncing the newest, unread messages first) or after the earlier part has been updated (if syncing in chronological order).  ### Device info **Device:** HTC 10 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.30.8 **Desktop:** Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, Signal version 1.18.1  ### Link to debug log android: https://debuglogs.org/a746288528426141256c835a6ebb61b215b45cebfb598592c6ce659754b3238d desktop: https://debuglogs.org/b5987c5baecc47485d368ed87d66933f44a8b7ed20f4c9c93324fba04237a503  Note: I had a desktop conversation with a number ending in 84. There are three more recent messages from a number ending in 13 that were sent later, when my Signal was completely offline, and came to my Android app as new, unread messages. When I turned the desktop app on to get the debug log, there was of course the loading screen, no notifications, and these messages were correctly shown as read.   Oh, and by the way: while getting the phone debug log, I noticed an EMBARRASSING spelling error in the translated content.

Not sure, if this might be intended. However, it feels wrong to me as (1) an SMS typically does not have a read-receipt (sometimes it doesn't even have delivery receipts) and (2) it involves different transport modalities.  (2) might lead to effects that the SMS may have been delivered, but due to missing data on the other side, the Signal message is still in transport.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send Signal message - Send SMS message quickly afterwards (such that they have the same timestamp)  **Actual result:** Footer of Signal message (timestamp and delivery/read indicator) collapses. **Expected result:** Footer should be shown  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 8.1 **Signal version:** 4.50.5  ### Link to debug log Don't think its necessary.

My suggestion for fixing this would be to remove the misleading android:contentDescription xml attribute, and set the contentDescription in code based on the value of transportType.isSms(). My suggestion for the two strings would be ""send"" and ""send with insecure S M S"". The spaces in the contentDescription important to ensure that the TTS engine doesn't mangle the acronym by trying to turn it into a word.  I don't mind tackling this, but I'd like guidance from someone on the signal team as to whether this is an okay thing to do before I spend much time on it.","closed","wontfix,","ellenhp","2019-03-31T20:23:57Z","2022-02-04T13:14:15Z"

When I tap the play icon, it changes into a pause icon for about 3 seconds without playing any audio, and then it switches back to the play icon while the error message ""Error playing audio!"" appears.  Only this particular voice message doesn't play. All the other voice messages previously sent by this contact, and all my other contacts, play fine.  My contact can play the audio normally from her phone. I can also play the audio by either: * using Signal desktop * long-tap the audio message, save the it as a file on my SD card, rename the file extension from .attach to .mp4 and play that file using an audio player * renaming that file to .mp3 and re-sending it to another contact. That contact can play the audio but after pressing play, it stalls for a few seconds before actually starting to play. See the [debug log](https://debuglogs.org/0e1ae52cf3a90abc643abe6d6eebacfd1c80edd2c49c07d2b7ca84ac6f0692f3) of that contact.  ### Steps to reproduce - Download and unzip this [voice_message.zip](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/2878984/voice_message.zip). - Rename the file extension `.attach` into `.mp3` (it's actually an MP4 file, but we need a file extension that looks like an audio file). - Send yourself that file by pressing ""+"" button -> ""Audio"". You can also send it from another phone. - press the play button  **Actual result:** The voice message doesn't play. **Expected result:** The voice message plays.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy Note 2 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.33.5  ### Link to debug log  [Debug log just after failing to play the voice message](https://debuglogs.org/88111ed87f02add1aa8762c175f1e635e4e5757ebf8c3d1593b677e8feeae687).","closed","wontfix,","righy","2019-02-16T14:51:39Z","2022-02-04T14:14:30Z"

The contacts are synced to both Google Contacts and the People app.  Sync is definitely turned on in Outlook.  When I send a text through Outlook to one of the missing contacts, it correctly opens Signal and populates the number.  Signal is able to resolve that number into the proper name at this point.  If I receive a text from someone whose contact doesn't show up, Signal correctly identifies them.  This worked just fine in the past.  Reinstallation of Signal did not resolve the issue.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Start a new message - Type a name in the filter  **Actual result:** The name fails to show up. **Expected result:** The name will show up and let me send a text.  ### Screenshots ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10904006/50807488-94293b00-12c8-11e9-86cf-a112ae217010.png)   ### Device info **Device:** HTC U11 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.31.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/38506b1b45294dfc534df43fc7996ad7606bf34e28cff779b44b02d1f9c72fdc","closed","wontfix,","skjarl","2019-01-08T03:16:13Z","2022-01-27T14:31:38Z"

However, Signal does not show two SIM cards until it has been set as the default SMS app. If Signal is removed as the default SMS app, the dual SIM choice does persist though.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install one SIM card in your phone - Install and register Signal, do not make it your default SMS app - Add another SIM card to your phone - Try to send a message as SMS. Note you don't get to choose which SIM card to use. - Configure Signal as default SMS app. - Now you see two SMS options when you try to send as SMS. - Even if you choose an other SMS app to be the default, Signal will keep offering this choice.  **Expected result:**  Signal should discover Dual SIM even if it is not and never has been the default SMS app. Users who have not used Signal as default SMS app might still want to send SMS over either SIM card.   ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:**  4.39.0 (and also seen in earlier versions)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/85b96fd5f4ba2a34267ee007395eb555774a7d77d214e0512c089eedaeecf74c","closed","Multi-SIM,","Meteor0id","2019-04-30T22:51:49Z","2019-05-21T13:50:55Z"

After the transfer, neither phone would receive MMS message correctly.  Upon receiving an MMS message, an entry would be displayed saying ""Error downloading MMS message, tap to retry"".  I've gone through the MMS Troubleshooting page to the best of my ability to no avail.  For now, we must use a different messaging app since we _require_ MMS to work both for personal and business use, regardless of the reason why it doesn't work.  ### Steps to reproduce -Send MMS message from a non-Signal phone to one or both of the Signal phones.  **Actual result:** MMS message shows the error shown in the Screenshot **Expected result:** MMS message can be read  ### Screenshots ![screenshot_mms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17973793/51782740-81916d00-20e2-11e9-857b-7055d2608a27.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel XL **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.32.8 **Device:** Sony Xperia XA2 (Sony H3123) **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.32.8  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/0faef9882a7eb25307a9de1332c9238afefdc3f8071c6a8e0afa32ad1b4363e9","closed","wontfix,","metsuke0","2019-01-26T04:58:44Z","2022-02-04T13:14:12Z"

Other Android users see the generic Signal profile image. **Expected result:** Should take on users phone, desktop version and Android devices the user communicates with using Signal data.

For example, two signal users I chat with have given the Android app permission to access contacts. In one case my number is not in their contacts but in the other it is. The second user does not already use an image for my contact. If they withdraw permission for the app to access contacts as a test my profile image still does not take on their phone. I note that the name used in their contact list remained persistent in Signal app in this case rather than reverting to a number.

The backup process starts, but never completes. When I go back in the option, the ""Create backup"" option is greyed out for a while even though no backup is present.  ### Steps to reproduce - go to Settings > Chats and media > Backups - Activate ""Chat backups – Backup chats to external storage"" - Write down the passphrase and click ""Got it"" - Click on ""Create backup – Last backup: Never""  **Actual result:** - Signal computes the number of messages to archive (in my case, more than 43000) and put the ""Create backup"" status to ""In progress"" - After a while, the process stops. If I go to another screen (for instance in the Advanced settings to get Signal version number for that bug report) and come back, the “Create backup – Last backup: Never” is shown again. - No backup is available anywhere. Not on the external storage, nor on the internal one (nothing in `internal storage/Signal/Backups`)  **Expected result:** - The backup is created and available on the external storage (aka removable storage, i.e. the SD card available that has plenty of space, unlike the Internal storage)  ## Suggestions  - Change the wording from “Backup chats to external storage” to “Backup chats to internal storage”. For most users, ""external"" means ""that SD card I inserted and where I store my pictures and music"" - Estimate the required space for the backup. If space on storage is not enough, gracefully stop with an error message. - I've read the discussion in #8750 and understand that originally, backups were stored on SD card if possible, but that was removed because people lost their backups when they uninstalled  Signal. This is indeed a bad mechanism in Android, but Signal should try to mitigate it by giving the option to the user when creating a backup:     1. Create backup on internal storage     2. Create backup on external storage (if there is indeed an external storage available): if user selects this, a popup explaining the potential issue is shown (""Note that this backup will be removed if you uninstall the Signal app, so remember to store it somewhere safe once the process is complete."")

"","9317","Mexican contacts registered prior to phone number change only show up as non-signal contacts","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Mexico has recently [changed their phone numbers](https://www.mexperience.com/mexico-simplifies-telephone-dialing-rules/) by removing a trailing 1 after the country code. When re-installing signal, Mexican contacts that were registered prior to the number change (with 1 in their number) can no longer be added to signal and can't be found in contacts on signal.  A possible reason might be that google seems to modify existing numbers internally to reflect the removal of the 1, e.g. if you try to call an old Mexican number google will dial the new number without the 1 instead.  For existing conversations this causes strange in-between states where my Mexican contact has an existing and active signal conversation with me and can send messages on their end, but these appear as bad encrypted messages on my end where the conversation is treated as non-signal (only possible to send SMS messages and get the prompt to invite contact to signal). After reinstalling signal, my contact even received a notification for a change in my security number. Resetting secure connection on their end has no effect (the option is not visible on my end).   ### Steps to reproduce - Have an existing signal conversation with a Mexican contact - Edit number of Mexican contact in contacts app (remove 1) - Reinstall signal (restoring messages from backup does not affect bug) - Mexican contact cannot be found in signal (this is perhaps expected) - Add old contact number (with 1) or undo change from step 2 - Refresh contacts in signal  **Actual result:** Mexican contact cannot be found (only displayed as non-signal contact without 1 in their number). **Expected result:** Mexican contact should be found  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.52.4 (5842)   ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/f5152230ab6bec96d29e2c28580b0a2ba1b922ac367db695da0732a3fd0d1bd3","closed","","lem503","2020-01-04T15:42:24Z","2020-01-27T14:56:51Z"

I presume that trailing parentheses could be used for detecting the end of the URI as they should by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) be percent-encoded in URIs.

The chat was performed on the synced desktop, in which the order is ok, but on the android phone they came up in mixed order.  Looking at the message info on the android device for the message and its surrounding ones:  The message before (sent by me) - Sent Oct 10, 2019, 11:55:32 AM GMT +03:00  The problematic message (received) - Sent Oct 10, 2019, 1:23:37 PM GMT +03:00, Received Oct 10, 2019, 1:24:55 PM GMT +03:00  The next message (received) - Sent Oct 10, 2019, 11:55:35 AM GMT +03:00, Received Oct 10, 2019, 1:37:52 PM GMT +03:00  The next message (received) - Sent Oct 10, 2019, 11:55:41 AM GMT +03:00, Received Oct 10, 2019, 1:37:54 PM GMT +03:00  The next message (sent by me) - Sent Oct 10, 2019, 11:56:23 AM GMT +03:00  I don't know why the long delay before receiving the messages on the phone, but in any case they seem to have been received on it out of order and displayed correspondingly, which is wrong.  I don't know enough about the signal protocol to tell if the problem is in the sender, the server, or the recipient, but it seems in this case if the messages were ordered according to their sent timestamp, it would be correct. Or using an increasing sequence number generated for each message in a conversation, so clock changes/differences won't matter either. Or however it is other chat programs have been doing this for years... haven't seen this kind of out-of-order problem in any chat program before.   ### Steps to reproduce It doesn't happen all the time, though this is not the first time I've noticed a message in the wrong order. I don't know what causes it on some messages but not on most.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) Messages appear in wrong order. **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) Messages should appear in the correct natural order, which should be the same on all devices.  ### Device info Android 9 phone, Signal 4.47.7 Desktop running Kubuntu 18.04, Signal 1.27.3","closed","","amichair","2019-10-10T11:25:28Z","2021-12-26T09:36:26Z"

It is so bad that I literally stopped using the Android app because entering a conversation takes so long. Conversations are not as bad as the main conversation list. Is it the updated emoji set that's causing this? If I scroll in a conversation it does seem to stutter on messages that have several emojis.

Strange thing is when my friend lost today's messages suddenly some messages I sent hours ago doubled in my Signal desktop instance.  ### Steps to reproduce - Not sure how to reproduce it.  **Actual result:** Messages disappeared **Expected result:** Messages don't disappear  ### Device info My phone: Signal 4.33.5, Android 8.1 Friends Phone: Infinix Note 3, Signal 4.31.6, Android 6 My desktop version: 1.21.2   ### Link to debug log My friend submitted the log through the debug log submitting option in Signal. I have no idea where that log went to. But I could get another log if needed probably.","closed","wontfix,","uspoma","2019-02-16T21:27:09Z","2022-02-04T14:14:29Z"

Sending just text or other attachements works. Behavior might be related to the latest update. Appeared just since a few days ago.  ### Steps to reproduce - open contact - plus sign - select picture by preview or by gallery - press send arrow  **Actual result:** Message is not sent (neither text nor image), editor becomes empty, image disappears. **Expected result:** Image will be send and shown in message history.  ### Screenshots none  ### Device info **Device:** samsung GT-I9195I (serranoveltexx) **Android version:** 4.4.4 **Signal version:** 4.49.14 (5611)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/7574221d06566a34f5603ce16ce4fe4fcd3724c2c9c8311a01c7dc637f5b6776","closed","","tipuraneo","2019-11-03T10:13:45Z","2019-11-06T23:57:40Z"

I only see the unread messages marked when I enter the app, which is annoying. Sometimes when I am in the app I do receive messages instantly but not when I am not using the app. App message priority is set to ""urgent/critical"". I have not changed anything in the settings and I wonder if this has anything to with closed #7580, which I also experienced back then.  ### Steps to reproduce - Wait for messages to arrive on my phone and then bug occurs  **Actual result:**  I wake up my phone from standby - no LED is blinking nor notification badge icon is showing on signal app - assume no new messages are there - I enter signal app and realize there are one or more unread messages. My memory is that this bug was not there until 2-3 months or so.  **Expected result:**  I expect the LED to light up and keep blinking once a new message has arrived. I expect the notification badge icon to display and show the number of unread messages in the app.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy S7 Android version: 8.0.0 Signal version: 4.52.4  ### Link to debug log","closed","","whaco1","2019-12-29T10:56:18Z","2020-03-16T13:36:08Z"

Very often when sending messages I would only see one see one tick despite the message being received and read by my chat partner already. Furthermore even when the app is open and my partner is writing me I get the messages delayed and often many at the same time due the delay. Very often I only see a notification stating something like ""Fetching message"" and I do not actually receive the message until I force quit the app and restart.  Only very seldom I get messages on time and without actively opening Signal to check.  ### Device Google Pixel 2016, fully updated, latest Signal  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/6bc6d8c8e8d6612c4da8188b0961087d6e3939231c5886447fb0d39ca5cc03bc","closed","","Esokrates","2019-02-10T17:16:27Z","2020-05-08T02:36:57Z"

I expected, the person to leave the group automatically, when there is no signal account linked to the phone number. Like it's happening in encrypted chats. When a contact uninstalls signal, encrypted chats are not possible anymore.

This sounds like an off-by-one (incorrect counting during to typing animation) to me. Maybe related: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8851  ### Steps to reproduce - Have typing indicators enabled for both you and your contact. - Have a quoted message in the conversation. - Contact types a message. - During the animation, select the quoted message.  **Actual result:** The message below the quoted message is highlighted. If the typing animation is gone, the correct one is highlighted after tapping. **Expected result:** Correct quoted message is highlighted.  The message that has been quoted is 1559756822612. The message that gets highlighted during  the typing animation is 1559756839375.  ### Screenshots Didn't manage to capture some, but I guess this issue should be easily reproducible.  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 8.1 **Signal version:** 4.41.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/25d9c989555f4c6111d0ea8aed8ddd8cb67f817dc9aa9dcaca5a6b3947412d5e Unfortunately, this bug happened to me yesterday and I only managed to capture the log right now.

After that, I downloaded the new APK from https://signal.org/android/apk and updated manually, which worked. Unfortunately, I forgot to note the previous version.  I don't know what has changed since the last Signal update; there have been no system updates for a couple of months, and looking at the Signal source (with `git rev-list --all | xargs git grep REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`) says that hasn't changed either. I am, however, glancing suspiciously at b133546ca633af8e2708676797e9cdabe81458dd by @greyson-signal, which bumped the API version to 26, which according to https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES makes `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` mandatory.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install the Signal APK from https://signal.org/android/apk - Wait for an update notification - Tap the update notification  **Actual result:** The notification drawer retracts, but no update is installed **Expected result:** The update should be installed  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 Plus **Android version:** 8.1.0 (LineageOS 15.1) **Signal version:** 4.30.7 after update, unknown before","closed","","creideiki","2018-11-18T11:50:54Z","2019-01-13T22:26:11Z"

Please close if it's not a bug.  When opening a contact's profile page and clicking the ""back"" button in the upper left corner of the profile image, the on-touch color of the button is the signal blue. Clicking the ""back"" button opens the chat, which has a contact-specific accent color. I think therefore the ""back"" button should also use the contacts accent color because the blue signal color sometimes looks rather awkward dependending on the combination of the profile picture colors and the chosen contact accent color.  There is also an inconsistency with the ""back"" button in the chat itself. This ""back"" button has no on-touch color change at all.  ### Steps to reproduce - open a profile page - click and hold the ""back"" button on the profile page - look at the color change of the button - quit holding the button  - click and hold the ""back"" button on the chat page - look at the (non-existing) color change of the button  **Actual result:** Consistency is missing and signal color sometimes looks awkward. **Expected result:** Consistency in the UI and a non-awkward color choice.   ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus 3T **Android version:** 8.1 **Signal version:**  4.30.2 (and at least all versions since the UI improvement)  ### Link to debug log Just UI --> no debug log","closed","wontfix,","glU79z","2018-11-09T09:31:05Z","2022-02-04T16:16:45Z"

One of these people is someone I do not have in my contacts list. So instead of their name, only their phone number is displayed. When clicking on ""message details"" for any message I've sent, there is a list of the contacts in the chat who have read the message. The contact which I do not have in my address book is on the second slot of this list.   The problem is this: When opening this ""message details"" page for the first time, the first contact on this list will not have his name displayed. Instead, it displays the phone number of the second contact. Thus, the list will show two instances of the same contact in both slot one and two, while the 3rd and 4th slots display the other contacts normally.   When exiting this page, and again re-opening it, then problem fixes itself and the first contact is displayed normally in the list. This problem remains fixed until exiting the app and re-opening it, where this error can be re-discovered.  ### Steps to reproduce - Enter a group chat in which one of the users is a person who you do not have in your contact list - Open ""message details"" for any message you've sent - Observe the list of names of users who have seen the message  **Actual result:** Slot 1 and 2 display the same phone number, until exiting and then reopening the ""message details"" page.  **Expected result:** Slot 1 should show a different contact, and slot 2 should be the one with just the phone number  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 2 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.48.17","closed","","an0n7mous3","2019-10-26T00:18:31Z","2019-10-26T00:29:12Z"

The picture reaches 5% and then it's stuck. I try to send two more messages and they just refuse to send. I start to suspect my phone internet is dead, so I go outside and connect to McDonald's WiFi. Internet works flawlessly. I disconnect from McDonald's and I try my mobile data. Internet works flawlessly.  Now I'm at home on my WiFi and it's still not sending. I'm 99% sure a reboot of the phone will fix the issue, but this is still annoying and IMO it shouldn't happen at all.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Send a picture 2. Have your mobile data temporarily die for a couple of seconds 3. The image gets stuck, no matter how long I wait the image never officially ""fails"" 4. Nothing can be sent after it  **Actual result:** Images can get stuck indefinitely **Expected result:** Images automatically fail after a certain amount of time. Or even better, an image failing to send doesn't render the entire app useless until you restart the app/phone.  ### Device info Pixel XL Latest stock software. January update of 9.0, I believe.

The words are still wrapped. The blue underline for the selected item is transitioning nicely though.  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/5782c8a58bcdf8992e3ff0ad9ee815cfa6ecc4d3  This was also reported as beta feedback on the community forums, where @alan-signal has asked for more information, but not specified what information might be helpful to him  An other issue is that the sort by setting is not preserved. I don't see a reason not to preserve the setting. If a user has a preference to sort differently it is quite likely he will have that preference still the nect time he visits this menu.  ### Screenshots  Documenten is a single word.

My phone didn’t know it was unregistered, I noticed because I got alerted by someone who tried to call me on Signal and got a “this number is not registered” error. I unregistered from the phone and re-registered. After that communication was restored, and resetting secure sessions was not necessary.  It sounde like this very old, closed issue: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/4751  This is the second time in a short period I had this issue, see https://community.signalusers.org/t/i-suddenly-became-unregistered/5957  ### Steps to reproduce - register device on the Signal server and communicate - wait? - get a WhatsApp message from a contact that you can't be reaced on Signal because you're unregistered.  **Actual result:** Spontaneous loss of registration **Expected result:** remain registered as long as you don't manually unregister.  ### Device info **Device:** Sony Z3 Compact **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.33.1  ### Link to debug log This is the debuglog of the device that lost registration: https://debuglogs.org/903eda0661d12c63ca70eaa998f2b9423d73a58357868aca5b0bb262ed17ee16  This is de debuglog of a device with an open session with the device that lost registration that tried to send a message: https://debuglogs.org/52afe5ca62c687bfa113fd57c446a1129961cbf8c2b2434680ceecc0e9272de9","closed","","johanw666","2019-02-03T14:40:51Z","2019-05-07T18:56:56Z"

This works as intended until I get a message from a contact not in the group, that I have set to vibrate and sound on. Signal vibrates my phone as expected for that contact, however if I don't check the message right away and leave the notification in the notification bar, suddenly Signal starts vibrating my phone for each message I get from the group chat as well.  ### Steps to reproduce Start a chat or group chat, set vibration and sound to none/off. Have a contact message you that you do have vibration set to on for, and then have the chat with vibration/sound off message you. You will get a vibration for that message as well, when you shouldn't  **Actual result:**  Signal vibrates the phone for the message from the chat with vibration set to off.  **Expected result:**  It shouldn't vibrate the phone for that message.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S10 **Android version:** Stock 9.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.41.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/a99a8f91e28f73a671c7354d59d23b84039060919a5be3b1c7c6ac8bdd46b80c","closed","wontfix,","jonathanturcotte","2019-06-19T01:45:37Z","2022-02-04T08:38:23Z"
"","9081","Signal keeps crashing every time I try to download MMS","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description I keep getting mostly blank bubbles (with the exception of ""MMS"" next to a down arrow indicating the MMS needs to be downloaded and the text ""Error downloading MMS message, tap to retry"") when someone sends pictures, since my cell connection is often weak or nonexistent, so the images don't come through. The problem is, earlier when I would tap it to download it, Signal kept crashing, over and over and over. The first time it just crashed silently, sending me back to my home screen. The other times I was presented with the Google crash feedback page, which I submitted a few times. I also captured a debug log (below).  In addition to this issue, Signal should automatically download the messages whenever possible, so if I have reception but don't think to open it and manually download them all (not to mention doing so one-by-one is slow, though I'm still not sure if that's necessary, since I *think* manually downloading one makes them all download), they'll be viewable later. Another issue I have related to this is that when people send messages in a group chat, they often show in a separate conversation just with that person first, then later (I assume once I get good enough reception for Signal to be able to recognize the message was sent as part of the group chat) it will merge into the group chat. This is especially problematic because if I mute the group chat to keep my phone from blowing up, I'll still get notifications from the messages that aren't immediately included in it. I'm not sure if this is an issue with Signal, though, or simply a limitation any app would have with having limited reception.  ### Steps to reproduce - Get MMS while phone has poor signal - Go to area with good signal and tap download button on MMS bubble  **Actual result:**  MMS should download, preferably in background and allowing multiple messages to be downloaded simultaneously. **Expected result:** Signal crashes. Note this is the first time this has happened, despite having to manually download MMS messages multiple times previously.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Moto Z Play **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.47.7  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/c0b19775d5dcc57aa2b5097f8a61ef275bd57f9a30aa432662fb58037d7d22b5","closed","mms,","vertigo220","2019-10-07T16:53:00Z","2021-02-13T19:50:50Z"

Everything went ok but for some reason Signal doesnt import sync my sms database, even though it says that it did. I have a 7000+messages database so this makes the app unusable. I have used the apk from the website since i dont use Google Play on my phone.(removed it) I still have Google play services with all the permissions enabled. (except location) My default SMS app is QKSMS, however i dont think that is the issue since i have tried to use the default Google messages and Signal didnt work as well.   ### Steps to reproduce - Install Signal on new phone - Complete the registration - When asked, make Signal the default sms app and sync it with the database **Actual result:** No messages are actually synced, even though Signal says it was successful **Expected result:** Messages are synced and all the conversation appear in the Signal app   ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei P20 Pro **Android version:** 9.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.41.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/5d4cde10eca963baf9d84137a938344e86143e3ef2810d795fbf2ba12d33c0f7","closed","","ghost","2019-06-22T04:05:11Z","2022-08-02T15:35:29Z"

Signal Desktop on my computers still had all my conversations, but my phone was not linked anymore to them. I had to delete all the data from one computer to link it to my phone. And the day after, it lost the link (but retrieve my conversations) and it asked to link again my phone.  2. I had a group conversation, and I cannot send/receive messages on it with my phone. But I still can on the computer where I did not delete all the data.   ### Steps to reproduce - restore your iPhone with signal desktop installed on a computer **Actual result:** I have to delete data from signal desktop to be able to link again, and I cannot send/receive messages from my group conversations with my restored phone. **Expected result:** I would expect to be able to link my phone to my computer without having to delete all the data on the computer.

Occasionally, when I open Signal, I then start receiving a flood of past messages from both other participants. However, rather than simply updating the conversation with the new messages, they arrive one at a time, with roughly 1/2 second delay between them.

I would expect always to be able to hang up an active call.  ### Screenshots None  ### Device info Device  : bq Aquaris X5 Plus (Aquaris_X5_Plus) Android : 7.1.1 (684, 2.7.0_20181002-1711) Memory  : 64M (22.83% free, 512M max) Memclass: 192 OS Host : bqbot3 App     : Signal 4.30.8  ### Link to debug log Issue happened around: 2018-12-11 19:24:26.017 https://debuglogs.org/48a66b462dbbe20b276a9122958f730eb5220b6abefa9a92923ccf2f1600aa08","closed","wontfix,","janvlug","2018-12-11T18:55:18Z","2022-02-04T16:16:57Z"

Then I went to sleep (didn't open Signal after an update) And in the morning when I woke up my battery was almost completely drained and there was a notification that an app is detected draining a battery. It seems that based on the graph, issue started to happen sometimes around 1 am and continued  during the night.  Based on the logs and the wakelock GUID I see in the logs this message and it keeps repeating so I guess this is what kept waking the phone, but I don't know why since internet was working correctly in the morning when I woke up.

It seems if you write enough messages, the timer doesn't start or perhaps resets if the messages are really high up in the chat.  Note that I've never seen this for a message that *I've* sent. Only for messages that *she* has sent.  ### Steps to reproduce I'm guessing something like 0. Set the SD-timer to 1 day 1. Write a lot of messages every day 2. Send a lot of pics every day 3. After about a week, wait for all messages to be deleted 4. You will now, if you're ""lucky"", see some old messages that are still around 5. The SD-timer will start for these messages and they will be deleted like 7 days too late  **Actual result:** The SD-timer seems to be stuck for some messages **Expected result:** The SD-timer should *never* be stuck for any message  ### Device info Device : Google Pixel XL (marlin) Android : 9 (5180536, PQ2A.190205.003)  Memory : 36M (31.92% free, 512M max)  Memclass: 256  OS Host : wprf7.hot.corp.google.com  App : Signal 4.35.2   ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/365685b203af81f5c29c8f3124f8250b6a98fa29cdc1dd59e389654408cd94f9 Message IDs: Sent: 1551792031089 Received: 1551792708076  Sent: 1551801540752 Received: 1551804818455  Edit: Unless I'm doing something wrong, these IDs don't seem to be a part of the log at all :( Pretty sure I saved the log right after I saw the old messages though.  ### Related https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7356","closed","","Dyras","2019-03-10T19:06:52Z","2022-04-04T17:14:19Z"

Send a video on a public WiFi, presumably one with a poor connection 2. The video gets stuck and disappears from your phone 3. Go about your day, with mobile data enabled 4.

This all used to work just wonderfully, but it suddenly broke several weeks ago. Videos appear to just be an audio clip (see image below), but upon pressing Play, I get a toast message that says ""Error playing audio!"" GIFs come through as a static image, no animation. Pictures seem very compressed/blurry. If I switch my default messaging app to Android's Messages, I receive all MMS just fine (videos play and download, GIFs are animated, pictures are not super compressed). Turning Wifi calling has no affect (actually it made GIFs come through as static _black and white_ images?). Turning WiFi off has no affect. Going into airplane mode and enabling mobile data has no affect. I have exhausted my searching and there seem to be some similar issues, like https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8571 (which is closed), but nothing that fits exactly. Most related issues seem to display an 'Error downloading MMS' message, but I get no such thing.  ### Steps to reproduce - Ask a friend to send me a video, GIF, or picture using any app other than Signal (for example an iPhone user using iMessages) - Wait for the Signal notification on my phone - Open the message  **Actual result:** The video appears as an audio clip and upon pressing play, a toast is displayed that says ""Error playing audio!"", the GIF doesn't animate, or the picture is very compressed/blurry. **Expected result:** The video has a thumbnail and plays, the GIF is animated, and the picture has a much higher resolution.  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20191214-133850](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17731026/70853256-74f04180-1e79-11ea-8bea-799d992994ac.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 2 (walleye) **Android version:** 10 (5974827, QQ1A.191205.008) **Signal version:** 4.51.6 (5792) **Carrier:** Verizon Wireless  ### Access Point NOTE: I cannot edit my access point because Verizon has locked it down.

However, this is not what happens with Signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - Ensure your phone is not on mute (ringtone volume > 0). - have someone call you on Signal. - Wait for the ringing. - Hit the volume down button.  **Expected result:**  Ringing sound muted while the incoming call keeps on incoming (not dropped).  **Actual result:**  The volume keys adjust the ""call volume"". Alternatively, if one has the top-menu (the one holding the wifi/ location/ sound/ torch and so on toggle-buttons) pulled down, hitting the volume keys during an incoming call would adjust the ""ringtone"" volume, which would adjust the volume of the ringing. Just to stress the point, however, in the latter case, even if the top-menu being down was not necessary, that (adjusting the ringing volume) is *not* the desired behaviour. Assuming that the ringing is there to bring to one's attention the fact that a call is being received and not to play music, there is no reason to adjust the volume of the ring in ""real time"". Supposedly the ring-muting is there in particular for those situation when one's phone starts ringing and it is a really, really bad time for it to ring. You want to kill the sound as quickly as possible.    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung J5 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.29.7","closed","wontfix,","Konotorious","2018-11-03T21:12:33Z","2022-05-15T02:52:12Z"

Android's contact list does not show 'signal text' and 'signal voice' in contacts that I know are using Signal. Chosing one of those contacts in Signal, I can send them encrypted texts via the Signal network, but they still will not show as Signal recognised contacts. Their names then would appear not as the names I have for them in Android's contact list, but as they appear in their Signal profiles, as would happen with contacts who are not in my Android's contact list. Signal used to work on the same phone before a system reset.  Android's accounts show that Signal account completes syncing. Removing the Signal account from Android's accounts and pulling the contact list downwards to sync from within Signal doesn't fix it. This has been reproduced several times, including after re-registering and re-installing Signal, and on using two ISP connections.  ### Steps to reproduce - install Signal - register account - sync contacts or wait for contacts to be synced -  **Actual result:** contacts appear as SMS only contact, but can be contacted via the Signal network **Expected result:** contacts appear as recognised Signal contacts, with their names and pictures pulled from Android's contacts.  ### Screenshots  ![screenshot_20190131-082740](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4465939/52137836-8e99e900-2619-11e9-8155-20b824ffa098.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Nexus 5 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.32.8  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/a51e64183d610f54fc7437d71c4836650eff045f807d886f8fb2de03ccd0931a","closed","","amrgharbeia","2019-02-01T16:55:07Z","2019-08-20T13:50:41Z"

Once Signal is open, toasts for previously received messages shouldn't be displayed, since it's safe to assume the user can see them since they're displayed on the screen.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive text message - Unlock phone - Open Signal (Not sure if it's only when opened right after unlocking phone. I think it does it even if launching Signal after the phone's been unlocked for a while)  **Actual result:** You'll be in Signal, looking at a list of conversations, including seeing new messages, yet you'll be presented with an obnoxious toast notification telling you that you have a new message, which at this point is obvious. **Expected result:** If I'm already in Signal, I can see that there are new messages, and don't need a toast notification popping up to tell me. So at that point it shouldn't show except for messages received while in Signal, and only then for ones received for other conversations than the one you're in.  ### Device info  **Device:** Moto Z Play **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.31.6","closed","wontfix,","vertigo220","2018-12-27T16:17:52Z","2022-02-03T14:26:06Z"

When I went to the 'edit group' menu on the receiving device it still showed the previous avatar.  ### Steps to reproduce - Change group avatar - Check group avatar on group member device   **Actual result:** Changing group avatar only changes group avatar on local device and changes the group avatar to the default group avatar on group members devices. **Expected result:** Group avatar should change for all group members.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S6 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.32.7  ### Link to debug log Log from my device (device that changes the group avatar) https://debuglogs.org/a3d22ef0f46d7363fdc719d6d666cf1c9159eb92200905eac5eb714b3a892827 Log from group members device https://debuglogs.org/b3ffc92e74d22c7b4886fb2543490a62ab6348edd3b2fb6ec7d9482788aca5bb","closed","","bme13","2019-01-20T13:44:03Z","2019-01-20T22:17:52Z"

Note: This is caused by bad data in one of my contacts.  ### Steps to reproduce 1) Add a contact with a name of Clinic and a phone number (NOT email) of clinic@example.com.  This cannot be done through the Android UI--it has to be imported via an app, etc. 2) Open Signal 3) Click the search magnifying class 4) Select in the search box so the keyboard opens 5) Type clinic 6) Signal closes  Removing the invalid phone number resolves the situation and Signal no longer crashes.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Signal closes  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  The search results would be displayed for

Which e.g. allowed you to change the notification sound. this has now changed, the conversation settings of the note-to-self contact now miss most of the settings a regular contact has.  background for me using this setting: i had set a non-default notification sound for my own messages in the past, but after reinstalling signal i can't set it any longer. those self-messages are happening when a linked device, in this case my linux box running the signal command line client, sends me a message. as that's usually an important notification (e.g. failed harddrive), i'd like to have a different notification sound for my own messages. might sound weird, but worked well in the past :)  i see that this setting would not be needed if no linked devices would exist since then the note you just wrote would instantly and automatically be marked as read and no notification would be played anyway. but since linked devices are a thing in the signal universe, you can get a message from an external device and a notification sound will be played then. therefore it would be nice if the option to configure it could be reinstated.   since there is sill an empty, scrollable box where the missing settings once were, i assume their absence is actually a bug introduced with the recent note-to-self feature and not a design decision though.  ### Steps to reproduce - select any contact conversation - open conversation settings -> chat settings - see that there is an option 'notification sound' - open the note-to-self conversation - open conversation settings -> chat settings - see that there is no option 'notification sound'  **Actual result:** note to self has a mostly empty layout where the settings should be **Expected result:** the full set of options is also offered for this contact  ### Screenshots  ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Redmi4X **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.35.3  ### Link to debug log","closed","","d-t-o","2019-03-23T13:26:05Z","2020-03-23T12:31:33Z"

That prevents me from customizing notifications by conversation (e.g. muting or enable vibrations).  Not sure if the system limits the number of channels though.  ### Steps to reproduce - In Signal application, list and count every conversations you have - Compare the list with the one in Android's notification channels (from Android 8, API 26):     - Go in _Settings_ app > _Apps & notifications_ > _Signal_ > _App notifications_     - In _Messages_ section, retrieve every customizable conversations   **Expected result:** In Android's notification channels, I was expecting to see **every** conversations seen in the Signal app, that is Signal one-to-one conversations, Signal group conversations, one-to-one SMS conversations, etc.  I've got something like thirty conversation in Signal: - at least eight of them are one-to-one conversations - at least four of them are group conversations - the rest being SMS.  **Actual result:** Only four entries are shown: - three conversations:     - two SMS conversations     - one Signal group conversation - and _Default_ entry  **Additional information**  The weird thing is conversations shown in Android's notification channels are pretty old conversations: 1. First entry in Android's notification channel is conversation A in Signal:     - First message: 3rd Nov 2017     - Last message: 4th Jun 2018 2. Second entry in Android's notification channel is conversation B in Signal:     - First message: 8th Sept 2017     - Last message: 27th Feb 2018 3. Third entry in Android's notification channel is conversation C in Signal:     - First message: before 23rd Aug 2017     - Last message: 27th Nov 2018  I've got conversations much more recent, and other much more older than that.  Other thing: at the very bottom of Android's notification channel, the following message is displayed:  > 7 categories deleted  I've tried to backup the conversations, wipe app data, and import the backup. Same exact result, with the same three conversations I was talking to in _The weird thing_ part.   ### Screenshots In red: two SMS conversations In green: one Signal group conversation  ![screenshot_20190105-181315](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/752443/50727563-f7766a00-111c-11e9-90ce-96a91d70e28e.png) ![screenshot_20190105-181321](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/752443/50727594-53d98980-111d-11e9-82cc-1c8463080d87.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** LGE H971 (a.k.a.

Some additional information although I'm not sure if this is related. At 14:07 I did send a message to a group. One of the members changes phones yesterday. I did spoke him yesterday and he asked me to 'add him to the group' again. I did so this morning by updating the group. That worked however if I check the details for the message I send to the group I noticed there is no sealed sender icon for him anymore (I've enabled this and it was shown before he changed phones) Based on the logfile the notification started at 15:07. Perhaps there was some background messaging for the profiles that triggered this notification? Just my guess though.  ### Steps to reproduce Unable to reproduce.  **Actual result:** No new message arrived although a notification showed 'Retrieving  a message' **Expected result:** If a notification 'Retrieving a message' is shown a new message should arrive.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung SM-G900F **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.31.6  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/7ce9bcd07abcf09fb75e88d63a9f22871043a19ba804904876eb28a21a75266e","closed","","bme13","2018-12-16T16:03:38Z","2019-01-06T20:53:56Z"

The position of the drawn scribble (or highlight) is dependent upon the rotation of the device, and the scribble move when the device is rotated.  This is not the case with stickers/smileys or text that is placed onto the photo - those things stay when the phone is rotated.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start sending a picture with Signal - In the Signal photo editor, draw a scribble or use the highlighter tool - Rotate the phone (auto-rotate must be turned on, see #8515) - The scribble or highlight will move on the photo  **Actual result:** The scribble moves **Expected result:** It should not  ### Screenshots ## Example 1 ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3249268/51215999-d7029880-18f0-11e9-8348-9f12fc7d76b8.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** Galaxy S9 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.31.7  ## Details: The scribble stays in the same position in screen space. However, the photo is resized in screen space when the phone is rotated. E.g. a 1920x1440 photo could also take up that many pixels on the screen when the phone is horizontal, but when the phone is vertical the 1920x1440 photo will only take up 1440x1080 pixels on the screen. The scribble position seems to be fixed to the screen pixels, not image pixels:  ![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3249268/51216099-3365b800-18f1-11e9-952b-2c513384786c.png)  In the above png, the image is 1920x1440. On the left side, a rectangle scribble was drawn with its top left corner at (105, 140) on the image and the screen. When rotated to vertical, the rectangle should stick to (105, 140) in the image, and be at a smaller (x, y) coordinate on the screen. But the opposite happens - the rectangle sticks to (105, 140) on the screen and ends up being at a different place in the image.  Example of the smileys and text decorations behaving correctly (they stick to the bottom left corner of the monitor in the photo): ![all](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3249268/51216145-54c6a400-18f1-11e9-855f-fb9c8ca27d0c.jpg)  And finally, some more examples of the scribbles moving: ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3249268/51216164-6740dd80-18f1-11e9-9584-0852c2344628.jpg) ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3249268/51216167-69a33780-18f1-11e9-879e-649057b444a2.jpg) ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3249268/51216171-6c9e2800-18f1-11e9-85fc-139defbc776e.jpg)","closed","","subraizada3","2019-01-15T23:14:48Z","2019-01-15T23:35:50Z"

In the battery settings page, it shows ""Signal used for X time"", where X is the amount of time since the full last charge (see screenshots; i.e. I did _not_ use Signal actively for 6:34h). 2. If I disable the lock notification (with screen lock still enabled), I get a persistent notification that ""Signal is using battery"", when in background as long as the timeout has not expired.  ### Steps to reproduce For 1: - Enable Signal's screen lock  Additionally for 2: - Disable screen lock notification - Put Signal to background, to foreground and to background again  **Actual result:** Battery settings page shows ""Signal used for X time"" (see screenshots). If screen lock notification is disabled, phone additionally shows the ""Signal is using battery"" notification.  If the screen lock has a timeout, this notification disappears after the timeout and the ""active use"" seems also to work fine then. I don't really feel like there is any additional (heavy) battery drain (several minutes of usage result in similar battery use as e.g. WhatsApp). But I also can't tell, if it's really the same,   **Expected result:** Since I am on a GCM-enabeled device, I would expect no persistent notification and the ""correct""/reasonable amount of active time in the battery settings page.   To check, if this is actually related to Signal at all, I started a [discussion](https://community.signalusers.org/t/general-question-regarding-battery-usage-on-android-8-1/4685) in the community forum before. From the discussion: - I tried to re-register my account (probably in order to ensure that the GCM registration is working). - I have absolutely no issues with receiving messages or calls, when Signal is in the background.  ### Screenshots ![](https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/2X/3/3c8bd7bad271e90ddd9b5db70a3b1d745efb449a.png) ![](https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/2X/e/e35d8fc730856a2d36f50f5c4115d77883786d85.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 8.1 (Stock Android (from Motorola) with Google Play Services; unrooted, no 3rd party ROM etc.) **Signal version:** 4.30.2 (from PlayStore)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/4143751f893439f1deb887bbcf75b21943e49db5464c97ae67af89f16199c83a I captured the debug log after: 1. Fully charging the battery, disabling screen lock, force closing Signal and starting it again. 2.

Fully charging the battery again, enabling screen lock (without force closing Signal), enabling screen lock notification, putting Signal to background, to foreground and to background again. 4. Doing similar things as in 2 with the result: ""active use"" 25min, last full charge 25min. Phone does not show ""Signal is using battery"", it only shows ""Signal is locked"". 5. Fully charging the battery again, disabling lock notification, putting Signal to background, to foreground and to background again. 6.

I can still see the following icons: - Flash icon - Switch camera icon - See pictures (buttom left corner) - Take picture botton  **Expected result:**  I expect to be able to take a picture ;-)  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei Mate 10 Pro (BLA-L29) **Android version:** 9.1.0.306 **Signal version:** 4.49.18  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/8fcb16c1a48aa40b9d7fb13e57627c7ab76aeb6bbd5958d8eb427e4e20416ca2","closed","","EchersMedia","2019-11-13T08:33:06Z","2021-02-22T23:41:05Z"

I don't remember doing anything in particular. I noticed when one day I got a message, wanted to open it, and the app crashed. Whenever I tried to start it from the menu it would crash almost immediately. I remember this was a problem at least on 4.41.5 a now on 4.41.6.  Signal crashed both when I tried recovering from an existing backup and when I tried to go to a fresh slate. Today I got around to looking at logcat. The app was crashing with an NPE when it tried to do something with contacts. It turns out the app won't crash if I deny contacts permission on Android level. But if I denied access to contacts during setup, it wouldn't let me restore from backup. So I allowed access to contacts during the backup restoration process (after fresh install from app store) and let the app crash afterwards. Then I disabled contacts permission, started the app, and it worked!  Later on I was reading the debug log and I saw that Signal wrote log messages like these ""Adding: +1206xxxxxxx"". I looked at the last phone number just before the crash. It was a contact that had nothing special about it. Just a phone number and a name. I also didn't really care about preserving it. I thought maybe something in the contact record itself caused the crash so I deleted the contact. I then re-enabled contacts permission and Signal now works. Unfortunately, I haven't tried re-enabling the permission and starting the app before deleting the contact so I'm not sure whether temporarily removing the contacts permission was the thing that got it working or whether it was the contact I deleted. My bad.  ### Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, I'm not able to reproduce this issue once I fixed it as described above.  ### Screenshots None, app crashed immediately.  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus 5. build A5000_23_190610 **Android version:** Android 9, OP5_O2_BETA_34 **Signal version:** 4.41.6  ### Crash stack trace ```plain 06-17 21:40:09.678 30912 30957 E DirectoryHelper: [Batch]

When opening the conversation list, the ellipsis oscillates and causes emojis in the conversation title to jiggle **if this title contains emoji**. This behaviour is also visible in the title when opening the conversation and can also be seen in the message preview in the conversation list.  ### Steps to reproduce - create a contact/group with a title that has to be shortened - insert an emoji into the title - open the conversation list with this contact/group visible in the list  **OR** - open the conversation with this contact/group  **Actual result:** The contact's/group's title's ellipsis oscillates and causes emojis in the title to jiggle. **Expected result:** The ellipsis does not oscillate.  ### Screenshots  _without ellipsis (actual)_ ![withoutellipsis cens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42788925/52877773-4ae7c900-315b-11e9-8bca-7c1a7b9868c2.png) _with ellipsis (expected)_ ![withellipsis cens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42788925/52877775-4ae7c900-315b-11e9-9511-cb280146d62d.png) It will oscillate between these states, sometimes several times in one second, and then stop at the expected state.  ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia Z2 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.57.2  ### Link to debug log  [can be sent upon request]","closed","wontfix,","hwinnemoe","2019-02-15T19:05:03Z","2022-02-04T02:04:20Z"

That means: Only one single person to person chat affected as far as I know. And one group chat. - Signal app has all permissions enabled. - Crash happens on WiFi, mobile data connections (4G), and when internet access is disabled - Clearing cache and uninstall and reinstall the app (restoring backup with the affected chats) doesn't help - Rebooting phone doesn't help - Possibly related to bugs #8807 #8667  ### Steps to reproduce - Open app - Click on the affected group chat or the affected person to person chat - App crash  **Actual result:** Can't open and read messages in any of the two affected chats. App asks if app should be restarted or bug report should be sent (I’ve choosen many times to sent the bug report).  **Expected result:** Chat/conversation should be opened and should show all the messages, that have been exchanged in this chat.  ### Screenshots N/A   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S6 (SM-G920F) **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.47.6  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/a838818989f8a80f46b5fc4eda3183fcb926b2e6d6046690d78664406bf6a9ac","closed","","erik55","2019-09-24T10:01:19Z","2019-09-25T15:39:54Z"

On Oppo phone, with battery optimisation settings sorted: - do not optimize battery for Signal - do not kill signal in background or if issue is encountered - max notification priority in both signal and android settings  Notifications are not received except of the signal app is opened. Sometimes notification are received if the signal app is in the background however, it is not great as if the signal app get closed then notifications stopped being received.  Please note I have unregistered and re-registered. This help as now I can receive notifications if the app has been opened and is still opened in the background (before I had to open the app in the foreground to receive notifications). However, if the app is closed (from the swith app menu, I am **not** talking about a force stop) then notifications stop.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. start the phone 2. someone sends you a signal message (**not** SMS) 3. actual: no notification, expected: notification  1. start signal app, see all notification 2. close signal app (using the app switch menu) 3. someone sends you a signal message (**not** SMS) 4. actual: no notification, expected: notification  ### Screenshots Let me know if you need those  ### Device info Let me come back to you on this one (wife's phone) **Device:** Oppo CPH1715 **Android version:** 6.0 (ColorOS V3.0.0i) **Signal version:** 4.31.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/2403397b841eb983cc424600326d341eb2ff5c042a1296033d3a6d02e912a7da","closed","","D4nte","2019-01-08T23:57:43Z","2019-05-31T14:31:31Z"

These are classified into three obvious groups: emoji-default, text-default, and text-only. See the section on presentation style in [Unicode TS#51](https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Presentation_Style). There are two additional variation sequence code points, that can be used to get the non-default behaviour.  However, currently Signal on Android displays a lot of Unicode characters as emojis without these modifiers. See [this issue on Signal Desktop](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2969) for why it's annoying.  Affected characters are things like ™️, ®️, etc.  ### Steps to reproduce - Compose a message with ™️ in it entered as a Unicode symbol (U+2122)  **Actual result:** The character is displayed as an emoji. **Expected result:** The character should be displayed as text.  ### Device info  **Device:** LG **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.31.5","closed","wontfix,","aapeliv","2018-12-22T15:34:09Z","2022-02-04T14:14:11Z"

Signal does not handle these well and makes it difficult to find these photos when attaching them to a message.  Note that in the filesystem these special two-file directories are subdirectories of the ""main"" Camera folder. Google Photos also has the concept of a ""main"" photo between the two. It doesn't seem like there's a way to get at which of the two files is the preferred ""main"" photo from a 3rd party app, but I haven't investigated exhaustively.  ### Steps to reproduce  * Take a photo in portrait mode in the Google Camera * Go into a Signal conversation, hit the `+` button to attach, then tap Gallery  **Actual result:** I'm shown a lot of folders - there's a folder for Camera, as expected, but there are also lots of folders for specific photos with multiple versions (e.g. portrait mode and non-portrait mode). These folders have names like e.g. `IMG_20190818_213457`. **Expected result:** these photos should be displayed in the Camera folder, similar to how they're displayed in the same section as ""normal"" photos in the Photos app.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a XL **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.49.15  ### Link to debug log  Doesn't seem necessary since this behavior is relatively obvious, though if you want I'd be happy to prepare one.","closed","wontfix,","strugee","2019-11-07T22:00:59Z","2022-02-04T08:38:20Z"

It never happened in previous versions. It appears that the system needs to be asleep for some time. Just putting it to sleep and waking it right back up doesn't reproduce the issue.

And by the way, the same applies for other messages, like when we set the Disappearing Messages time for a given person, and so on. Those messages don't get deleted either.  ### Steps to reproduce  - Just set the disappearing time for messages to any time (the shorter the better to duplicate this) - Send a couple of messages - Place (or receive) some calls - Send a couple of messages  **Actual result:** After the ""expiration"" time passes, the messages are deleted, the call history does not.  **Expected result:** Nothing in the conversation is kept beyond that period.  ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei Nexus 6P **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.43.8","closed","","x80486","2019-07-13T13:54:32Z","2019-11-09T00:18:04Z"

The problem is that Signal doesn't seems to use it because it shows me the notification ""Background connection enabled"".  I checked how long Signal was running in the background and it shows me that Signal was only running in foreground.  I've setup Signal by restoring a backup but I'm not sure if that is related.  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G (7) Play **Android version:** 9.0.0 (Security Patch Level: 1 June 2019) **Signal version:** 4.45.2","closed","","floriangosse","2019-08-20T21:04:44Z","2020-05-14T14:31:29Z"

I confirmed this: Signal claims to support accepting a panic trigger, but it does nothing in response.  My guess is that this is because the Signal-specific PIN feature seems to have be removed, and now there is only something that is chained to the lockscreen.  Ideally, Signal would again lock itself, exit and hide as it was doing before.  Other possible lesser responses are:  * just exit and hide from Recents * set the Signal view state to the front page, away from any active chat logs  Signal also seems well prepared to support some new ""destructive"" panic button responses like:  * wipe all disappearing messages (perhaps this could be an option when setting the timeframe for disappearing messages) * entirely wipe itself and exit, if Signal backups are enabled * wipe all backups  ### Steps to reproduce - install Ripple - see Signal listed as an option (based on the entry in Signal's AndroidManifest.xml) - trigger Ripple to send the trigger to Signal - see that Signal is in the same state  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Signal claims to support a panic trigger, but seems to do absolutely nothing in response.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Before, Signal locked itself, then exited and hid itself from the ""Recents"".   FYI, the panic support was added in  #5550","closed","wontfix,","eighthave","2019-05-31T13:29:31Z","2022-04-11T04:36:43Z"

I have experienced this for past few days ~~and finally through the community forum learned that I may get it to open in Airplane mode and testing various options (WLAN on, mobile off, reverse and clicking the options) I found out that WiFi Calling causes the issue.

For each of the two group SMS conversations that have been active since I updated to 4.49.18 (maybe 2-4 weeks since the previous update), I now have an additional two conversations with the same participants. Here are examples; I've renamed the participants, but the renaming is consistent and preserves alphabetical order:  - ""Me, Ben, James"" (old) - ""James, Ben, Me"" (new)   and  - ""Me, Ben, James, Bernie"" (old) - ""James, Ben, Me, Bernie"" (new)  No participants have changed, no contacts have been updated. Each contact has only one phone number attached. I can send messages from either conversation and I think they go to all recipients, but when I receive messages, they only go to the new conversation. So now my chat history for these groups  is spread across two conversations; several years' worth in the ""old"" convo and the last few days in the ""new"" convo.   ### Steps to reproduce  - Start a group SMS conversation with friends - Update to 4.49.18 - Have a friend send a group SMS to the group - Observe that Signal creates a new conversation with the participants in a different order and delivers new messages there instead of the old group  **Actual result:** I have two conversations for the same group SMS with the same participants. **Expected result:** All conversations with the same participants should be merged into a single conversation.   ### Device info  **Device:** Blackberry Priv **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.49.18  ### Link to debug log  Not applicable, the new conversations were created a few days ago.","open","sms,","mildmojo","2019-11-21T21:27:12Z","2022-06-13T15:14:19Z"

Initially some messages on Signal Desktop arrived (which I already had read and responded to on Android) correctly when I clicked on the conversation of this contact. Then the message ""Safety number has changed"" appeared. The next three messages of the contact (that arrived correctly on Android) stated ""Error handling incoming message"". My own messages of this part of the conversation appeared correctly. When I had a look after this on Signal Android, I saw that one of my own messages (that originally was correctly delivered)  had ""Send failed, tap for details"" below it.

(Also not able to send/receive calls, but a ""missing called"" notice is received by the other part.)  ### Steps to reproduce - Update Signal 4.47.7->4.49.15 - Start Signal again (and wait for ""Signal update"", I guess some database update) - (Potentially block Signal (""Linux kernel"" process) from accessing servers for a while when trying to send some secure messages,and then unblock everything) - A: Send a secure message to someone - B: Secure calling someone (not relayed call)  **Actual result:** A: Message not delivered. Only a rotating dotted ball next to the messages (tried several contacts). B: Just Dialling / Establishing Signal call - but a Missed call notice is received by the other part.  (Because of the ""Rate limit exceeded"" in the log I also tried turning off all internet connection for half an hour and tested again, if the servers thought it was spam, but no difference.)  **Expected result:** A: Message delivered to Signal server at least. B: Call gets connected.  ### Device info **Device:** Oneplus 6 **Android version:** 8.1.0 (rooted) **Signal version:** 4.49.15  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/4c898a9faf0b3196f2ec48489e9ae3a06bdbfaa1093ada73560ea73f578c1b75 (The debug log is from the device newly restarted with first scenario A and then B)  After the update it is no longer possible to backup in Chats & Media (tried resetting the backup keys also), and nothing is shown about that in logcat (should make another bug report about it maybe).

Signal uses the phone number to verify/identify a user. As https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9383-compromising_online_accounts_by_cracking_voicemail_systems shows, this is an insecure verification process, because an attacker could register for any phone number.  Apart from the privacy concerns of having to disclose the phone number to communication partners, this is now also a demonstrated security risk. Please provide an option to register for Signal with an anonymous pair of user name and password plus (optional or at least one-time ""device verification"") 2FA token (TOTP). For existing users there needs to be an option to remove the phone number from the ""account"" and replace it with the chosen user name. Even better if all users are upgrade to that scheme.

Out of ~200 contacts, none with extremely long name-entries, at least one contact (named Mark A________) is not discoverable when tapping the pencil-icon, and then typing in ""mark"" to search for that person... despite an existing SMS-only conversation with that person within signal4android!  Markus, who is a different person, and who is registered with signal-server, *does* show up when performing the selfsame search for ""mark"" via pencil-icon.   At least two people have reported this kind of buggy behavior in the community.signalUser.org forums, the first one on Jan.15th (the mentioned father), and the second one Jan.22nd the latter of which is specifically the subject in this very github-issue-report.    ### Steps to reproduce  - install signal, with both SMS and addressbook integration enabled (i.e. the defaults)  - start a chat-conversation with Mark, an SMS-only contact  - later, open the conversation list, tap the pencil, search for ""mark"" within the enter_name_or_number textfield   **Actual result:** Markus, a different person, properly appears in the search-results, but Mark improperly does not show up in the search-results (the conversation with him *is* visible in the conversation list however... and his addressbook entry is visible in the stock Contacts addressbook-app)  **Expected result:** Mark, Markus, and all other contacts containing that substring somewheres (whether registered with signal-server or not... whether the substring is stored in their signal-profile or not... and whether the substring is stored in the integrated addressbook-entry corresponding to them or not), should jointly appear in the search-results for the substring ""mark"" so long as at least ONE of the places mentioned contains a case-insensitive match of the specified substring ... which may be numeric, alphabetic, or alphanumeric.   ### Screenshots  Imagefile with three screenshots, and commentary explaining what is happening, can be found here == https://community.signalusers.org/t/contacts-not-showing-up/5615/15   ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus ONEPLUS A6013 (OnePlus6T) **Android version:** 9.x (1812260627, ONEPLUS A6013_41_181226) **Signal version:** 4.32.8  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/ccff4c9beb67bc7a6c68ac24bc15029871526bf18879f03ae0dcd5652e2d77a8  Just prior to capturing the debuglog, searched with pencil-icon for  * 'Markus'  * 'mark' * 'Mark'  * 'LastNameOfMarkGoesHere' *  'ThreeNumeralsFromPhoneNumberOfMark'  *  'KeywordFromConversationMessageWithMark'   Most of which (improperly) failed to turn up the person named Mark in the search-results... but most of which *did* (properly) turn up the person named Markus... the exception being the final KeywordFromConversationMessageWithMark.   Used the same exact test-phrases, but instead of clicking the pencil-icon to search contacts, clicked the magnifying-glass icon to perform a full-text-search.  **This** portion of the test was successful, for five out of the six test-phrases -- however, for some reason, trying to use the magnifying-glass and full-text-search for ThreeNumeralsFromPhoneNumberOfMark (e.g. '123' hypothetically) did *not* turn up anything.    There was only one seemingly-relevant exception in the debuglog related to the search-attempts, not sure if it was triggered by the pencil-icon searching, or by the magnifying-glass-icon searching:    ``` 01-24 14:53:07.199 28178 28186 W System  : A resource failed to call close.  01-24 14:53:07.202 28178 28186 W SQLiteCompiledSql: Releasing statement in a finalizer.

Not sure editing my comment will avoid emailing repo-watchers, but with luck it will not :-)     ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description When she enables disappearing-messages for her chat or groupchat with Bob, on the conversation-list Alice expects to see Bob near the top, when they have recently conversed.  However, after the disappearing-messages timer has expired, the conversation-list entry for the chat/groupchat in question Alice was recently having with Bob, will plummet downward in the sort-order.  Even if it was the most-recently-active-conversation for Alice, it will often no longer be at the top of her conversation-list.    If Alice has enough contacts with disappearing-messages enabled, this behavior makes the conversation-list sorting-order (MRU to LRU plus archive-folder) almost useless.  Even if she only has just *one* conversation configured with a short disappearing-messages timer, though, that conversation will regularly be buried somewhere down the conversation-list sort-order.    Note:  this github-issue is *not* related to message-ordering in the chat-history, which is a different bug, it is related to conversation-ordering in the conversation-list.  Existing discussions:  this one from Dec.2018 signal4android, and another one from Feb.2019 signal4ios.   ### Steps to reproduce - HH:38 create mini-groupchat with 2 participants, set disappear-timer to 5mins  - HH:43 after waiting a little while, and scrolling around a bit to refresh the displays, conversation-lists on both A and B display ""5mins"" as the lastmod (correct)  - HH:43 A sends ""m1"" to B  - HH:43 chat-screen of A shows double-unfilled-checkmarks and 'now' in chat-bubble  - HH:43 conv-list   of B shows bolded excerpt ""m1"" (implies double-unfilled-checkmarks) and 'now' as lastmod  - HH:46 both screens still claim ""now"" (cached/incorrectly) ... scrolling around a bit causes them to refresh and say ""2min"" in chat-bubble and lastmod  - HH:47 both screens still claim ""2min"" (cached/incorrectly) ... scrolling around a bit causes them to refresh and say ""4min"" in chat-bubble and lastmod  - HH:48 both screens still claim ""4min"" (cached/incorrectly) ... scrolling around a bit causes them to refresh and say ""5min"" in chat-bubble and lastmod  - HH:48 the chat-bubble on A disappears, because the timer there expired  - HH:49 conv-list of A shows **""12 mins""** as the lastmod after hitting backbtn, which is ""inaccurate"" since the lastmod was only 6mins ago  - HH:49 after scrolling around a bit, lastmod on B now says 6min, still bolded ""m1"" and still indicated there is an unread message  - HH:51 after opening the unread message, lastmod on B now says 8min , no longer bolded, no longer indicates there is an unread message  - HH:53 after opening the unread message, lastmod on B now says 9min , no longer bolded, no longer indicates there is an unread message  - HH:53 sent ""m2"" from B back to A, lastmod on both A and B again says 'now' (correctly)  - HH:55 manually deleted ""m2"" from device B, lastmod now **""11 mins""** (should say 1min).  over on device A, lastmod is 1min (correct).  - HH:56 on device B lastmod now 12 mins (should say 2min).  over on device A, lastmod is 2min.  ... timeout reached on device B, lastmod changes to 18mins (not 12... not 2)  - HH:58 on device B lastmod now 19 mins (should say 3min),  over on device A manually deleted newest ""R one"" while still mostly-unread, then back to conv-list and see ""19min"" lastmod there as well (should say 3min).   **Actual result:** Conversion-list assumes that the MRU-ness of each item, can be determined from the timestamps in the chat-bubbles therein, which have not yet been deleted (either via disappearing-messages timer or manually).  Conversations with disappearing-messages enabled, pop to the top when a recent message arrives... then after the message is read, a few minutes later when the timer expires, the conversation in question plummets down the conversation-list to an indeterminate location.    **Expected result:**  Conversation-list show which *conversation-list items* were MRU, using a separately-maintained lastmod timestamp.  When a conversation receives a new message, it will pop to the top of the conversation-list.  Even after individual chat-bubbles have disappeared within the chat-history, the associate conversation-list item will hold a stable position at the appropriate location of the conversation-list sort-order, based on when the conversation was actually last active (sent or received a message), and will display a lastmod timestamp which corresponds to the most recent such event.    ### Screenshots  Some signal4ios screenshots are shown here, signal4android was similar result.  Let me know if you cannot reproduce the behavior, and I can upload some android-screenshots plus android-debuglogs.   ### Device info  **Device:** Alcatel A574BL  **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.34.8  ### Link to debug log   Captured some debuglogs as part of signal4ios troubleshooting, which has the same basic issue with lastmod-timestamps:  conversation-list items periodically re-order themselves when the most recent message hits the disappearing-message timer... at which point the conversation-list item in question drops downwards in the MostRecentlyUsed ordering to a quasi-randomized location in the past.  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/issues/4143#issuecomment-468656342","closed","","five-c-d","2019-03-05T22:55:44Z","2019-03-07T17:58:35Z"

Although it would have been nice to be able to do so, the developers have made clear they choose not yo make this possible for the time being.  Greyson in [a post on the beta feedback didcussion](https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-4-52-release/10643/11?u=meteor0id) : > Disallowing replies with stickers was an intentional choice due to some design/UX difficulties. Adding support for replying with stickers would require another rollout similar to a lot of our features, where we ship receive support before send support. So no changes on that front in this beta, but maybe in a future release  Meanwhile quote replies with stickers are not handled very well, allowing usrrs to fall into the trap of thinking they can quote reply with a sticker, but ending with the annoying realization that you ended up only sending the sticker eithout the quoted reply.  I am calling this a bug because it seems it was simply forgotten to design an appropriate way to handle replying with stickers.  ### Steps to reproduce - swipe a message to start quote reply - open the sticker menu and choose a sticker  **Actual result:**  The sticker sends, but not as a reply. The quoted message preview remains open even after sending.  **Expected result:** **Assuming replying with stickers (which would be preferable) will not be implemented at this time, the following is expected meanwhile**: The sticker should not send at all when a quote is being previewed. Instead of sending the sticker, the quote preview should get dismissed and the sticker menu should remain open. If the user still wishes to send the sticker he can simply press it again. Furthermore there could also be a toast message “You can’t use stickers as a reply” to make even more clear to users why this is happening.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 9.0 **Signal version:** 4.52.1  ### Link to debug log","closed","","Meteor0id","2019-12-19T03:18:45Z","2022-05-02T13:22:47Z"

My friend has also reported that messages take longer to send, they do have gapps.  If a phone doesn't have Google Play Services and uses a Wireguard (userspace) VPN, Signal often delays notifications a lot (up to 30 mins), while other apps work perfectly fine.  Sometimes messages won't send, force stopping Signal helps alleviate that.  This didn't occur while using OpenVPN or StrongSwan.  Making Signal and WireGuard a priviledged system app didn't help, nor did allowing them to run in the background.   ## Steps to reproduce - Use Signal without Gapps, with a WireGuard VPN - Someone sends me a message while Signal isn't foreground - Message takes a long time to arrive - Sending messages sometimes doesn't work without killing Signal  ## Device info  Device: LG G6 Android version: 9.0.0 Signal version: 4.38.3  Wireguard version: 0.0.20190319 Wireguard Go Userspace Backend version: 0.0.20181222  ## Screenshots No screenshots necessary, I think, can still provide if necessary, but it's just delayed messages  ## App state Signal messages and calls registered, SMS disabled, passphrase enabled  ## Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/816f1c1ac906ec2305d230ffae6f80482eef33b3642644e6ba4590aa3f7f6e7f","closed","wontfix,","Atrate","2019-05-07T20:18:58Z","2022-02-04T11:03:31Z"

Why is there an option ""Create backup"" when there is already an option ""Chat backups""? I have seen many issues like these where the original English text string is ambiguous. Normally I would raise an issue in Transifex. In this case however, the functionality of the options also makes no sense.  There are two options: ""Chat backups"" which creates backups automatically at a time interval. ""Create backup"" which creates a backup right at this moment, and will not automatically repeat unless the other option is enabled.  Now look at the screenshot. Does that seem obvious? It doesn't to me. In fact it is confusing.  Even worse, Why can't I create a backup right now, without enabling automated backups? Why is the second option disabled, when the first option is switched off?  I don't think the backup functions where supposed to be implemented like this, and if they were, I still suggest changing them. I propose the following:  Change the text strings:  >  > ""Create backups automatically"" > ""Backup all conversations to external storage every now and then""  >  > ""Create a backup now"" > ""Last backup: Never""  The first option should not disable the second. One should not depend on the other. At enabling either one, check if the required permissions were given.  Maybe we should also add an option:  >  > ""Reset the password for backups"" > ""Stop making backups with the current password, and create a new backup file with a new password. You must do this if you lost your 30-digit your password.""  Don't forget to update text stings for the support center.  ![screenshot signal backups 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/50459913-4deee600-0970-11e9-9c96-747f60b2c58f.png)","closed","","Meteor0id","2018-12-26T23:54:15Z","2019-03-28T01:19:45Z"

This forces the user to re-select it every time. Many people who have signal but don't use it as the default messenger don't check their Signal messages often or at all. Most of these people forget they installed it. This forces me to select ""Insecure SMS"" every time I need to message one of these people. I consider it a glitch that Signal does not remember this setting once it is selected for a certain contact. Fixing this would make Signal a practical choice for a default messenger. Most people refuse to use signal as default because a lot of recipients don't receive/check the messages that are sent. I use it as default and countless times my messages go unanswered because I forgot to reset this setting.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open a conversation with someone who doesn't use signal as default or has signal notifications turned off. - Long press the send button to select ""Insecure SMS"" - Navigate away from that conversation and return to it.  **Actual result:** The ""Insecure SMS"" has reverted to ""Signal"" **Expected result:** I expect Signal to remember the SMS setting for specific contacts to compensate for the large number of people who install the app and forget about it.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei Nexus 6P **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.37.2  ### Link to debug log","closed","","iduno8912","2019-04-17T21:31:14Z","2019-04-17T22:04:34Z"

When you first install Signal, it has link previews enabled by default.  ### Steps to reproduce  Just install the app.  **Actual result:**  Notice that ""Send link previews"" is enabled under Privacy in Settings.  **Expected result:**  This should be disabled by default. It's bad enough that Signal uses phone numbers plus SMS for signup as opposed to usernames plus proof-of-work. At least, we can always get the SMS on one phone, and enter it into another phone, in order to obscure the association between Signal usage, phone number, and IMEI. But with link previews enabled, this all goes out the window. We end up sending our social network configuration to Imgur, Instagram, Pintrest, Reddit, and YouTube in the form of common content fetches within tight time windows. Say I visit reddit/something. Then I send it to you. You're smart about social network reverse engineering, so you do the right thing and delay for a long time (probably days) before clicking the link. But that's defeated by the fact that the link preview hit reddit/something as soon as the phone got the message. As a result, Reddit sees that IP address X and IP address Y hit the same thing at nearly the same time. After a ""few"" more such samples, it works out that the people living at X and Y are associated, probably direct friends. Worse, if we are both logged in, then it knows a lot more about us, perhaps our names and approximate locations. Link previews is great for apps that don't care about anonymity. In Signal, though, it should be opt-in-to-shoot-self-in-foot type of stuff.  The only thing worse is having to report this at Github, which deanonymizes everyone via fckcing 2FA, no stylometry needed! But that's not your fault. Please just consider it as evidence of how concerned I am about this issue.  Finally, links in general shouldn't just fire off the browser when touched. It's just waaay to easy to do that by mistake. Even ignoring all the potential malware ramifications, it's broadly deanonymizing for exactly the reasons stated above. At the very least, it should come up with a dialog saying ""Are you sure you want to effectively tell this website that you're socially connected to your messaging peer? Do you trust this website? Will browsing this link tell your internet provider about you?"" Better yet, have an option to just display links as ""https://..."" so they can be copied into an anonymizing browser elsewhere.  ### Device info  Device: Samsung Galaxy S5 Android 5.0 Signal: 4.42.3","closed","","signaltester","2019-08-03T09:31:00Z","2019-08-07T18:15:05Z"

In practice, what I get is: - The contacts in my latest conversations appear, but only as phone numbers - The contacts that are registered to Signal appear, with name inside parenthesis and preceeded by a '~'.  ### Steps to reproduce  Context: I'm quite a security paranoïd, that's why I use Signal. When I install an App, the first thing I do (even before launching it), it to review asked permissions and remove all useless permissions. In the case of Signal, I remove the ""Modify contacts"" permission and allow only ""Read contacts"". This should be sufficient to see & have a conversation with my Android contacts, but disallow modification of the entries. This is not the case.  - Install Signal - Change App permissions of ""Modify Contacts"" to ""deny"" - Try to Access and/or Update contact list  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  No contact is read from Android, only users registred to Signal appear in the list  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  All contacts should be correctly *read* from Android.  ### Device info **Device:** WOAOSON A9500 **Android version:** 4.4.2 **Signal version:** 4.48.17","closed","wontfix,","liar666","2019-11-03T17:11:16Z","2022-02-04T08:38:16Z"

It didn't happen from my previous phone,  but it happened as soon as I switched to this phone ~2 months ago (for the rest  very stable). **It seems to be related with starting the loudspeaker early during the call initialisation process, e.g., if I don't use the  loudspeaker or I do it when the call has been initialised and going, I do not recall having this problem.** EDIT: A previous version of this bug report did report connecting to iPhone signal users, but that is uncorrelated, as it happens also while connecting with other Android signal users.

I had version 4.32.x installed (with an imported backup from another phone) and recently made the jump to 4.33.x as it was finally available as .apk on the official site (and got rick rolled as well).  Sending messages were already stuck in v.4.32.x (also the latest one which should fix the issue) and backups also impossible from that time.  Turning Backup on in the setting works but the system never creates a backup (Last backup: none). I interpret the log that it's waiting for my positive response that I saved my backup password. But I always did it (trying at least 10 times). I also tried everything else which would came to my mind (also for my other problem that I can't send any message anymore) - this includes, several: phone restarts,  force app stops, delete of app cache, reinstalling the update, disable signal service, re-register signal service.  I'm somehow caught now because I want a clean reinstall (for hopefully solving my problem that I can't send message) but for that I need a (working) backup before.  ### Steps to reproduce - open settings - turn backup on - tick the check box - hit the button  **Actual result:** No Backup is taking.

They did not show up in Signal after manually opening the app either. It looks as if no SMS were received at all.  This is especially annoying because you never know, whether this Bug is actually happening. In my case it could have been already hundreds of messages I did not receive and I only found out now. I only noticed this because my TAN-Messages from my banking account did not arrive at my phone. Now I am thinking about disabling Signal as default for SMS because I need to receive SMS regularly for my work.  ### Steps to reproduce I have not found a way to reproduce this issue  Here is how I temporarily solved it, though: - Deactivated Signal as default application for SMS/MMS - Incoming SMS started to show up in the native SMS-App again (only new ones, though). - Reactivated Signal as default app for SMS, now it works again as intended, but how long will this last?  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) SMS would not be received and displayed inside the signal application. No sign for any incoming messages even though I sent plenty of messages from another phone to test.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) SMS should be displayed inside the signal application and there should also be a notification for incoming SMS   ### Screenshots -   ### Device info  **Device:** xiaomi mi 8, model M1803E1A **Android version:** 9 PKQ1 180729.001 **Signal version:** 4.43.8  ### Link to debug log This is the debug log after I fixed the issue with disabling and re-enabling signal as default for SMS/MMS.  https://debuglogs.org/70467c473cb5899b52162257acd59bc0909984fc0617b3857d059c3363d7a6d5","closed","wontfix,","metaluks","2019-07-12T23:35:12Z","2022-02-04T08:38:11Z"

The same photograph extracted/downloaded/saved from Signal chat back to the phone memory are only a fraction of the size, e.g:      orinigal size of the photo before posting on Signal: 1.5MB     size of the same photo extracted/saved from Signal chat: 300KB (!!!)  What happened?  This is unacceptable to modify any user files without a warning or option to ""keep original file size"" vs ""compress / modify"".  Be aware that many files contain extra data, e.g. metadata or even steganography embedded information. When Signal modifies the files it damages them irreversibly.  Signal app should not be tempted to shrink/compress images to optimize memory usage. Such action not only damages file/image quality (resolution,compression factor) but also damages metadata and embedded steganography files.  Please keep all the files, including images/photos, unchanged when posting and saving to/from Signal, regardless of their original size.  ### Steps to reproduce The same photograph extracted/downloaded/saved from Signal chat back to the phone memory are only a fraction of the size, e.g:      step one: orinigal size of the photo (JPG) before posting on Signal: 1.5MB     step two: send that file using Signal chat.     step three: extract/save that photo from Signal chat back to phone memory: size shrunk to 300KB (!!!)  What happened to the file? Why did it shrink? How? What's the compression algorithm? Where is warning to users about such background modification?  **Actual result:**   Photo/image (JPG) extract / saved from Signal chat back to the phone memory is modified to a fraction of its original size (300KB vs 1.5MB of the original size).  **Expected result:**   Signal app should not be tempted to shrink/compress images to optimize memory usage. Such action not only damages file/image quality (resolution,compression factor) but also damages metadata and embedded steganography files.  Please keep all the files, including images/photos, unchanged when posting and saving to/from Signal, regardless of their original size.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7  / herolte /  **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.49.18  ### Link to debug log","closed","","qubecub","2019-11-21T07:49:55Z","2021-06-25T16:09:19Z"

I can use the app for a while after importing, then it crashes and I am unable to open it (crash on open).   ### Steps to reproduce I can't figure the exact steps that makes the app crash. I  imported a backup from an old phone (Signal version 4.47.6 on LineageOS 14.1-20190125-suzuran), the app works for a while and then it crashes on opening.   ### Device info  **Device:**  Pixel 3 XL **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.49.18   ### Link to debug log Since the app was crashing on open, I've got the logs with adb. ```java --------- beginning of crash 11-12 16:57:51.360

Mainly in how to create new ones and re-opening up pre-existing ones. Below is a list of the changes made:  1. Fixed bug when making a new MMS group it would not add you to the group (creating 2 MMS groups when someone responded) 2. Updated MMS groups to have an editable group name & avatar 3. Added new text to tell the user if a group message is an MMS message 4. Added a ""Create Group Message"" button to the home screen. To activate long press the floating ""New Message"" button (looks like a pencil) on the main page and it will pop up. Additionally you can long press and swipe up in the same motion to make a new Group Message. (the option to make a group message in the menu (ellipses button) still exists) 5. Update Group Message screen to auto fill Avatar & Group Name with existing avatar and group name if the group already exists. 6. Updated to the latest version of Signal 4.32.6","closed","wontfix,","drohack","2019-03-05T20:35:13Z","2022-02-02T05:08:59Z"

This PR aims to solve the ones that happen when opening and closing the activity. The AsyncTasks created in the initializeSecurity() and saveDraft() methods have implicit references to the activity. By moving the code of these AsyncTasks to separate classes and making weak references to the activity, these references are not created and the memory can be liberated. As seen in the memory profiling below, when the app is put in background, memory can be freed up. ![asdf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18556257/69491709-be470580-0e66-11ea-9be8-102bc9ecbab4.png)","closed","wontfix,","diegoramosb","2019-11-24T08:09:31Z","2022-07-07T06:34:43Z"

This margin has been re-implemented using the proper ""fitsSystemWindows"" attribute, which was designed for this purpose.  This also has the side effect of dropping the top scrim to below the status bar, which as far as I can tell, was the intended location for it in the first place.  I did not find any open issues for this bug.   Note: The status bar color is set to the contact's action bar color (`recipient.getColor().toActionBarColor(this)`), as a dark scrim is drawn over it. If the status bar was set to the correct color (`recipient.getColor().toStatusBarColor(this)`), then the final result would be too dark. This is how it was styled previously.  ### Pictures  #### Before ![before-notch1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509035/64072831-105aff00-cc5b-11e9-806f-d1fb01e472d2.png) ![before-notch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509035/64072832-105aff00-cc5b-11e9-8ae3-2aa7205c606f.png)  #### After ![after-notch1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509035/64072834-13ee8600-cc5b-11e9-8338-15e813f70d4f.png) ![after-notch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6509035/64072835-14871c80-cc5b-11e9-83ac-7ccb555ea305.png)","closed","","DuckyCrayfish","2019-09-01T06:54:11Z","2020-12-29T00:41:03Z"

The [Unicode Technical Standard 51](https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/) that defines Unicode emojis defines certain codepoints to be by default to be displayed as emoji and other to be displayed by default as text. One can always override this default by appending the `U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16` (for emoji) or `U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15` (text) codepoints after the emoji. The emoji selector screen handles these correctly. The iOS app also natively handles these correctly.  This PR adds this functionality into Signal Android. In particular, it stops certain unicode characters such as the trademark sign (™) from being displayed as text characters that makes them prettier and nicer to copy, in contrast to being displayed as a emoji with a different colour as previously. See #8480 and signalapp/Signal-Desktop#2969 for more details.  This is implemented as follows: the unicode emojis that are specifically to not be represented as emojis by default are in a `HashSet`. When the `emojiTree` is constructed, those emojis that end in `U+FE0F` and aren't in this set have an extra emoji added to the `emojiTree` without the `U+FE0F`. Code that previously replaced any unicode emoji with the emoji representation is removed.  Let me know what else needs to be done to merge this!","closed","wontfix,","aapeliv","2018-12-23T09:34:31Z","2022-02-02T06:09:29Z"

This word however is verbalizing what the user is looking for, but not what the button is offering. It is good practice for the text string to represent what the button is offering. It is up to the user to decide if this offered option is a match to what he is looking for.  The user is looking for a specific form of help. He might be looking for a use-guide, he might be looking for a community forum, he might be looking for a bug report system. By phrasing the button text as ""Use-guide and support"", the user is primed for what he will get to see if he presses this button. The text already confirms that he will find a use-guide if he presses this button. It also confirms that the same button offers at-least some form of support. Telling the user that this button offers ""Help"" is too vague. It does not define what kind of help. It leaves the user scrolling the support center trying to find out if he has reached the right place, because he has not yet been offered a clear indication of what to expect.  'Support' means “to receive help from others” and 'use-guide' means “a guide to proper use of something” a blog post about a new feature or a guide how to use the app are examples of a 'use-guide', a bug report system or a community forum are examples of 'support'.   The in app menu option “Help” would best be replaced by “Use-guide and support” for clarity. The word help doesn't really specify in what form one might expect to find help. Users usually have a specific question on their mind, and they are either looking for support with an issue, or for more information about using Signal.  This small change offers some confirmation that they are on the right path to find the kind of help they are looking for.  In a future version of Signal, the community forums and a bug report system _might_ be referenced by splitting the words ""use-guide"" and ""Support"" into their own categories. Ideally users are encouraged to first check the use-guide when there is a chance to find the answer there.  It is not necessary to edit the translations for the word ""help"" on short notice. This PR changes the name of the text string and the Dutch, German and English text string. Other text strings can follow over time, there is no urgency.","closed","","Meteor0id","2018-11-27T00:52:05Z","2019-05-07T14:14:39Z"

From reactions in the following days it became apparent some kind of distinct sound is actually preferred by some users, and I think that especially the visually impaired would greatly benefit from this difference, since they might not be able to reply on the textual difference on their call screen. As a solution, in this PR I propose to revert the changes made when removing sonar ping, but instead of the sonar ping sound use a sound which is much closer to the ringing sound itself. The idea is that anyone who doesn't care to hear the difference won't, but someone who pays attention to it can clearly hear it. The new connecting sound is identical to the ringing sound with the sole exeption being that the connecting sound is slightly shorter than the ringing sound (and thus also loops a bit faster).  I have also taken the opportunity to preform some noise reduction on the ringing and busy sounds. I have done this using audacity. I have take great care to preserve the old and authentic sound of the ringing sounds, while reducing the static, and making the quiet actually quiet. The timing of the tracks has also been perfected, to assure the looping is seamless from now on.  Excuse my ugly attempt to update my own master branch. GitHub isn't my thing.","open","","Meteor0id","2019-07-24T14:56:32Z","2022-06-30T19:12:59Z"

Also, it fixes a possible bug: when you get a missed call, and you select “Mark as Read” in the notification popup, that action didn’t work properly for the call-log entries (not 100% sure about this, it happens during my testing).  This PR was discussed and tested in sigX+sigGesT. Link to forum:  https://community.signalusers.org/t/experiment-disappearing-call-logs/8464  I copy below the implementation details as it was presented there.  ### Implementation details  Basically, the new code sets the EXPIRES_IN value within the database for each call-log item. The call logs are regular entries in the message store, so there is no need to modify the database schema – the EXPIRES_IN field is already there, just not getting utilized yet. Then, the code schedules the deletion of the call-log, if the expiration timer is non-zero.  The expiring timer code comes from another class “ConversationItemFooter”. The class where the call-logs are rendered (“ConversationUpdateItem”) manages the colors differently. I choose to not change anything more, and set the fill color of the timer icon the same way.  There is one subtle difference between disappearing-messages, and disappearing-call-logs. The expire-in value is a property of “DataMessage” in the protobuf schema. When you receive a regular message, this value (well, the minimum between this and your local expire-in value) is used to schedule when the message disappears. There is no such property for “CallMessage”, therefore, I always use the local expire-in value for call-logs.  For outgoing calls, it is not a problem. For incoming calls, it could be a problem – when the other party changes the disappearing-messages timer, sends the updated timer via sync-message, but we do not get that sync-message before receiving the incoming call via signal protocol. Not a big deal... and easy to fix, by extending “CallMessage” protobuf.","closed","","valldrac","2019-08-29T22:12:45Z","2019-10-09T13:47:25Z"

This caused the toolbar to clip into the status bar. This PR  fixes the issue by replacing the transparent nav and status bars with opaque fixed ones. This has the added benefit of a more attractively colored status bar.  If the transparency was set so that the nav bar matches the theme better, then the nav bar color can be changed manually to a white variant (as of API 27).   This change has been tested on both light and dark themes.

Some of the text strings were open to misinterpretation. In this PR we add missing [signal words](https://www.google.com/search?q=signal+words). Another major improvement is that some descriptions are more informative, allowing users to fully understand why there is a toggle switch, and what they are choosing between. Finally, consistency across strings has been reviewed, which also has a positive effect on translations.  Descriptions on in-app preferences should always assume the user has no pre-acquired knowledge or context.  This PR does not change the names (the keys) of the strings, because that would put extra workload on the translators. By not changing these the strings are treated by transifex as altered strings rather than new strings and the translation history remains available to help accelerate translation.  A few new strings have been added, but none have been removed. This PR needs more work, it does not yet touch the code where the new text strings are implemented. Feel free to assist in making the new strings useful.  There is no Github issue for this PR. This PR is addressing issues which have been discovered by the translators on Transifex. They are found in individual comments on text strings.  Commits are not in perfect logical chunks because a lot of minor changes were made over time, but the PR can easily be reviewed by looking at the file changes.","closed","wontfix,","Meteor0id","2019-03-28T02:29:25Z","2022-02-02T01:04:43Z"
"","8840","Key Not Yet Valid Exception After Restore","### Bug description   So I was trying to setup another account with my other sim for desktop pc usage and backed up the Signal app (v4.39.4) with Titanium Backup app, and then cleared the app data. I wasn't aware that keystore was being used since last year, i had long before restored a titanium backup of the signal app successfully, so the keystore thing didn't come to my mind. Clearing the app data also deleted the key from /data/misc/keystore/user_0 and once i had finished setting up the new account, and restored my previous backup, signal app started crashing with the expected key not found errors at startup. Thankfully (so I thought) I had a TWRP backup from Mar 8, 2019 that had the keystore key that was originally created on Feb 22, 2018. I extracted that from my TWRP backup and placed it in my keystore directory after renaming it with the signal app UID, and setting it to keystore ownership and the current signal app UID. I had hoped the key would be accepted and i could access my messages again but signal app still crashed on startup with ""Key not yet valid"" exceptions. I even extarcted the signal app (v.4.35.3) and its data from my Mar 8, 2019 TWRP backup and tried opening that but still the same error, Then I restored the entire TWRP backup as well, but still the same error. Anyways the key not yet valid error doesn't make sense. People on the internet who received the same error tried changing their timezones and that fixed it for them, and I did that too, moved it ahead, moved it back, changed the date to the future even back to Mar 8, 2019 and Feb 23, 2018 but nothing works.    Note that after complete TWRP restore i had to delete my lockscreen pattern, key and fingerprint files from /data/system to unlock my screen... But they have been changed probably multiple times after Feb 23, 2018, and I have also restored full TWRP backups successfully after that date anyways with the signal app working, atleast once [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=76772393&postcount=73). I also tried after deleting the pref_database_encrypted_secret and pref_log_encrypted_secret to no avail but that stage probably comes later.    So I got to investigating and going through the signal app source code and tracing the issue I found it even weirder that in the [KeyStoreHelper.java](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/crypto/KeyStoreHelper.java) file, which most likely creates the initial keystore key (probably created mine in Feb, 2018), the [setKeyValidityStart function](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setKeyValidityStart(java.util.Date)) is never called for the KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder, and by default, the key is valid at any instance in time. So why would the exception be thrown? And if I am not mistaken, I checked the commit history of KeyStoreHelper.java and key validity was never set in earlier versions too.    So do you have any thoughts about this or have I lost years of messages thanks to encryption which I wanted in the first place ;)  Thanks  ### Device info   **Device:** LG G5 RS988 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.39.4   ### Link to debug log   ```5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 5626 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.AssertionError: android.security.keystore.KeyNotYetValidException: Key not yet valid 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.KeyStoreHelper.unseal(KeyStoreHelper.java:73) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.logging.LogSecretProvider.parseEncryptedSecret(LogSecretProvider.java:36) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.logging.LogSecretProvider.getOrCreateAttachmentSecret(LogSecretProvider.java:21) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.logging.PersistentLogger.(PersistentLogger.java:48) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ApplicationContext.initializeLogging(ApplicationContext.java:177) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ApplicationContext.onCreate(ApplicationContext.java:107) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.Instrumentation.callApplicationOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1025) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.ActivityThread.handleBindApplication(ActivityThread.java:5512) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.invokeOriginalMethodNative(Native Method) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.handleHookedMethod(XposedBridge.java:360) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.ActivityThread.handleBindApplication() 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.ActivityThread.-wrap2(ActivityThread.java) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1572) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6247) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:872) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:762) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge.main(XposedBridge.java:107) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: android.security.keystore.KeyNotYetValidException: Key not yet valid 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.security.KeyStore.getInvalidKeyException(KeyStore.java:700) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.security.KeyStore.getInvalidKeyException(KeyStore.java:764) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.security.keystore.KeyStoreCryptoOperationUtils.getInvalidKeyExceptionForInit(KeyStoreCryptoOperationUtils.java:54) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.security.keystore.KeyStoreCryptoOperationUtils.getExceptionForCipherInit(KeyStoreCryptoOperationUtils.java:89) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.security.keystore.AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.ensureKeystoreOperationInitialized(AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.java:265) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.security.keystore.AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.engineInit(AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.java:148) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at javax.crypto.Cipher.tryTransformWithProvider(Cipher.java:2973) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at javax.crypto.Cipher.tryCombinations(Cipher.java:2884) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at javax.crypto.Cipher$SpiAndProviderUpdater.updateAndGetSpiAndProvider(Cipher.java:2789) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at javax.crypto.Cipher.chooseProvider(Cipher.java:956) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at javax.crypto.Cipher.init(Cipher.java:1329) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at javax.crypto.Cipher.init(Cipher.java:1267) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.KeyStoreHelper.unseal(KeyStoreHelper.java:69) 05-29 03:24:44.372  5626  5626 E AndroidRuntime: 	... 19 more ```","closed","","agnostic-apollo","2019-05-29T20:06:25Z","2019-05-30T15:51:52Z"

After recent updates of Signal app(I don't remember the exact version when this started happening) Signal doesn't show any notifications on the lock screen, also notifications on the Signal icon are showing inconsistently(It seems that it depends on whether Signal is locked or not).  I don't know if this information is of any use to you, but I am using several other messengers(Viber, Threema) and an SMS replacement app called Textra, all of them display notifications on the lock screen without any issues. System setting are the same for Signal and other messengers.  ### Steps to reproduce Use latest version of Signal from GP on MIUI 9.6.4 device.  **Actual result:** After receiving messages from my contacts there is no notifications on the lock screen.  **Expected result:** A proper notification is displayed on the lock screen when Signal receives new message.   ### Device info Xiaomi Redmi Note 5(MIUI 9.6.4 Global Stable) Android 8.1 Signal 4.32.8  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/88f884ba7f113cbda9d4914fe69a37563aee99d961a169b92b25273f5b2828d9","closed","wontfix,","Shir01","2019-02-07T22:09:05Z","2022-02-03T13:25:50Z"

"","8483","Signal desktop not syncing with signal messages received on the phone","### Bug description  In the scenario where when we receive the message with attachment and the attachment is not downloaded fully in the signal app then the subsequent messages are not getting sync up.   Other mentions of, or related to this issue:      in #5519, the original post isn't exactly about this, but this comment describes exactly this problem.     #6273 is about the divider between old and new messages. I haven't had a chance to check how this works (and if), but it sounds like the divider illustrates how the desktop messages are treated as new even though they've been read.     #6126 is this exact issue.     in #4905 the poster mentions both apps receiving messages and notifications at the same time when they're both online, but particularly this reply is about the problem when coming back from offline state, and mentions the way it should be: ""Can you fix the client to download and process all of the synced states before deciding whether to show any notifications?""     #3165 is one of the earlier mentions of this, and doesn't explicitly talk about the circumstances, but it's probably the same problem.     in #5410 it is pointed out that the issue is a duplicate of very similar ones. But that issue was posted over 2,5 years ago and it's still relevant. Not to mention the earlier issues.     #5741 mentions the phone buzzing while using the desktop, but it's related.     and finally #778, from February 2014, which may be the first mention of this problem. It describes the same thing: phone's been off while conversation continued on desktop, phone gets back online, cue many, many notifications. @moxie0 self-assigned also in 2014, no other actions there happened. More happened on #3165 instead (lots of mentions mostly), although there is no asignee or milestones there. Moxie closed that issue with this commit saying that it fixes two other issues, even though it doesn't fix the real problem of a LOT of notifications coming after a longer time offline, as opposed to while using the desktop and mobile at the same time. Android app shows countless notifications rapidly for old messages, already read in the desktop app #8445  ## Actual result:  The Android app displays and sounds tens of notifications, getting every single message as if it were a new one, only later marking it as read. If download fails it is not getting sync.   ## Expected Result: * User should be able to download contents send via desktop using mobile app. * If download fails on mobile, either it should be failed or success. Notification should sync with desktop.  * The messages that have already been read on the desktop app should be synced quietly and in the background, as they are already part of the conversation. If there are any new, unread messages, they can get a notification, either first (if syncing the newest, unread messages first) or after the earlier part has been updated (if syncing in chronological order). - [X ] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [ X] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [ X] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [ X] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus2 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.31.6  **Device:** Vivo V3 Max **Android version:** 5.1.1 **Windows Desktop version:** v1.19.0 **Signal version:** 4.31.6  **Device:** Asus Zenphone Max **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.30.8   ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/a3cba724f36eb7b8a8fbc5af886575c2eba39b4bfb793bdbf4545ca036f8cfda https://debuglogs.org/d54f8d28d6cddc77914ad2388dab7d5f8d178b0b568332f20557b16ad7097cc8 https://debuglogs.org/1e9ff36391619693ae7bc30654a95f31995ef49808777880543d9c59feb03a83 https://debuglogs.org/f6054ff17f08174bac4a118c09ed8480775c07a1fc34815cc36741c8c393f42d","closed","wontfix,","vishnuquilon","2018-12-24T10:42:12Z","2022-02-04T14:14:13Z"

"","8513","Registration on microG requires enabling Google Cloud Messaging","# Quick bug overview / Steps to reproduce  - Use microG and disable google cloud messaging - install Signal and attempt registration - Signal crashes during the registration process  # Detailed description and possible solution  MicroG is an unofficial and minimal alternative to Google Play Services. Its purpose is to increase privacy while still providing all of the features you would want on your phone (like GPS, push up notifications, …)  Now, Signal is able to run without Google services. During the registration, it performs a check on whether Google Play services are installed. If they aren't, it runs code that doesn't depend on them. If they are, it runs code that depends on Google cloud messaging. Now, microG has cloud messaging disabled by default, because it requires registering your device to Google with a unique identifier, which many microG users might not want. However, Signal recognizes microG as Google Play services, so it crashes when cloud messaging is disabled during registration.  I think it would be good to add an extra check whether cloud messaging is installed, and if it isn't, either prompt the user to activate it or give the option to continue without Google play services. I'd be willing to work on this if this is something with the potential to be merged. Otherwise, I'll just use a dirty hack instead.","closed","","kenogo","2019-01-07T20:21:57Z","2020-08-31T00:46:36Z"

And yet  * In 2017, Chromebooks made up [59% of mobile devices shipped to US schools](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2018/04/10/foolish-take-u-s-schools-love-chromebooks/498974002/)  * By January 2018, [25 million student alone use a Chromebook at school](https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-education-everything-you-need-know )  IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING, ABANDONING CHROMEBOOK USERS IS *NUTS*!  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/528174/48389429-41f5e000-e6b2-11e8-884a-e8a744c35132.png)  This patch enables Signal for Android to run decently on Chromebooks.  *  Because most (all?) Chromebooks do not have mobile service, they cannot receive SMS directly.  Therefore, you will probably have to verify your phone number by entering the confirmation code sent to your phone.  This is similar to running on an Android tablet.  *  Signal currently allows only *1* Android device per phone number. See [here](   https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320451-Troubleshooting-multiple-devices ).  So if you already use Signal on your phone, you will have to use another number (such as a Google Voice number available with your Google account) to set up Signal on Chromebook.  *  On the bright side, you get audio + video calls on your Chromebook!  *  Windows are re-sizable and the top window is not destroyed by escaping or hitting back (You can hit ^W to close it, however).  You also get multiple windows in newer development versions of ChromeOS, which is kind of cool.  File transfers, GIFS, and other basic features work well.  *  Chromebooks and QWERTY-keyboard devices enable the ""Enter sends"" preference by default, so that hitting the keyboard ENTER/RETURN will send the message (rather than add a linefeed).  *  If you run into build issues, look at Issue #8329 for a solution.  This currently builds successfully for me on Android 3.4 canary in Linux(though I'm sure it will build on older versions) with the easy #8329 fix that may not be needed on those older Android Studios.  NOTE:  Without this commit, there is currently no acceptable upgrade path for most current Chromebook owners. Although some CBs can run the standalone Desktop version via a ""Crostini"" Linux container, this is neither as lightweight nor as [available](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/22/google-confirms-many-older-chromebooks-wont-get-linux-apps-including-2015-chromebook-pixel/) as an Android solution.  (In the future, the Android client should be able to be run on the same account with the user's phone. But that's another commit altogether...)","closed","wontfix,","fat-tire","2018-11-13T03:46:52Z","2022-02-20T06:12:14Z"
