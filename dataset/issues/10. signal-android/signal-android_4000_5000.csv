"","7812","Convert vCard attachments into contact shares.","When you share a vCard from an external app (like the Contacts app) into Signal, we'll now convert it to a pretty Shared Contact message and allow you to choose which fields of the contact you wish to send.  To do this, we imported a new vCard parsing library. Then, the ContactShareEditActivity/ViewModel was adjusted to take in raw Uri's instead of system contact ID's. The ContactRepository will then convert the Uri to Contact by recognizing the authority and parsing as appropriate (either by reading the system contacts or the vCard).  Care was taken to ensure that vCard shares to non-signal users still use the legacy attachment flow.

"","7713","Onboarding Flow makes it easy to get trapped in a consent loop","When setting up an account, this happens when asking for permission to read SMSes for the verification process.  The app pops it's own dialog saying ""We're going to ask for permissions."" If you press ""Continue"", Android then asks for permissions whereupon you can ""Deny"". Signal then properly falls back to manual code verification.  However, I didn't even want to press ""Continue"". ""Not Now"" or ""No"" or whatever the option is should have just fallen into the same flow as if I Deny through Android. Instead, I was just stuck, unable to proceed.  To be honest, for the first 5 minutes I was losing hope and worrying that Signal was another app that wanted to aggressively skim data from my phone. I don't think that now, of course, but it was jarring.","closed","","colemickens","2018-04-20T17:03:51Z","2018-04-24T01:29:52Z"

"","7892","Show a banner in the event of a service outage.","We will now determine if there has been a service outage and render a banner at the top of the conversation list if we detect that there has been one.  To avoid hammering the status endpoint with requests, we only check for outages after a push message has failed to send. If an outage has been detected, we throttle subsequent outage requests for the same reason.  Also, given that making a network request is a potentially long operation, it was no longer suitable to run the reminder `isEligible()` checks in an anonymous AsyncTask, as that could result in leaking the ConversationListActivity. As a result, I took the opportunity to start a ViewModel class for the ConversationList and moved the reminder code in there.  **To-do** - [ ] Get final copy for the banner.  **Test Devices** * [Google Pixel, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel-8346.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-06-11T23:44:19Z","2018-06-14T20:19:39Z"

"","7546","Fill in attachment sizes when sending media.","We need to populate the UriAttachment models with width and height so that when we build DatabaseAttachment models from them, the dimensions are saved to the database.  I did this by adding a width and height field to the UriAttachment constructor, and then making sure that got filled in during the sending flow. All images should have a width and height populated (including GIFs), but otherwise the fields are left empty (0, 0).  **Test Cases** * Attached a JPEG * Attached a PNG * Attached a GIF * Attached an audio file (read 0, 0) * Attached a video (read 0, 0) * Used logging to verify that the attachment models that were part of the conversation adapter had widths and heights set, setting us up to be able to use them for sizing the ThumbnailView appropriately.  **Test Devices** * [Moto X (2nd Generation), Android 6.0](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-03-20T18:45:28Z","2018-03-29T22:47:23Z"
"","8269","Bump targetSdkVersion to 26.","We need to increase our targetSdk version to 26 to comply with Play Store policy. A lot of the work that needed to happen for this migration was done through our migration to WorkManager. This PR cleans up the last few things that I've found.  1. GenericForegroundService needs to be started with startForegroundService, since it can be started when the app is in a backgrounded state. This means we also _always_ need to call startForeground in the service. However, by always posting with the same notification ID and content, no flickering occurs on my test devices. 1. We had a boot receiver that would start MessageRetrievalService. Instead, I just schedule a message pull, which should have a similar effect. 1. We previously were starting KeyCachingService if we went to get the MasterSecret. However, by my read, this was just an optimization to ensure the value was cached in the future. Now we just kind of deal with having to read a non-cached value when the app is backgrounded.  **Test Devices** * [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php) * [Google Pixel 2, Android 9.0, API 28](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_2-8733.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-10-10T16:56:17Z","2018-10-17T19:47:33Z"
"","8039","Added new logger.","We have a problem where our debug logs don't go back very far. Right now, we rely on locally polling logcat. If we want to save more logs, we'll have to save them ourselves.  To do so, I've created a new logging layer called that mimics the interface of `Log`. You can add different `Loggers` to the new system. To start, I've added two Loggers: `AndroidLogger` and `PersistentLogger`. AndroidLogger just forwards everything to the standard Log command, while PersistentLogger persists logs on disk.  PersistentLogger works as follows: - All work is done on a dedicated single-thread executor to prevent slowing down other parts of the app. - Logs are written to a file until it hits a certain line length, at which point that file will be closed and a new one is started. - When a new log is started, we'll delete any log file that is over a specified limit (e.g. right now we keep no more than 5 log files). - A new global UncaughtExceptionHandler has been added to log crashes. - Log files are stored in the cache directory in order to allow the system to clean them up as needed. - During log submission, we'll include both the logcat logs and these new logs until we can verify their stability, at which point we may be able to remove logcat logs.  This PR just introduces the logger and not any usages (to prevent diff noise).  **Test Devices** - [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php) - [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-07-26T16:23:52Z","2018-08-01T14:32:01Z"

Because we listen to the system for contact changes to tell us when to sync, that could result in us sending an abundance of contact syncs to linked desktop instances.  This throttles these background syncs to happen no more than once every 6 hours. If a sync was throttled in the background, a dirty flag is set, and the sync request will be made the next time the app opens.  **Test Devices** * [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-07-07T00:33:37Z","2018-07-17T17:59:07Z"

"","7465","Bad old messages after database upgrade","Today I updated Signal to the new 4.16.9 version. After the database migration, Signal started giving notifications. I estimate roughly around 25 notifications. Some related to contacts with whom I have not been in contacts since long. From the notifications that are still visible I see: ""Bad encrypted message"" (3x), and ""Media message"" (4x).  I see for example a new ""Bad encrypted message"" with a sent date of 2 December 2016 and a receive date of 6 March 2018, via Data (signal).  For another contact for whom according to the notification I should have received at least five media messages, I see in his thread twice for today ""You safety number with xxx has changed"". This contact posted quite a lot of media messages in a Signal group in the past. I did delete a lot of the media to free up space in the past, because Signal was taking nearly all my storage (see issue 4242 and issue #6539).  All the conversations with the new messages appear at the bottom of the contact list (because it are old messages I suppose). The newest ""Bad encrypted messages seems to have been sent on 15 July 2017.  Unfortunately, submitting debug logs does still not work for me, see issue #7451.  In total there were at least 70 old messages marked as new. All of them images (that are not correctly displayed, I just see the download arrow, but downloading does not work), and bad encrypted messages and key change notifications.  Sending and receiving of new messages seems to work correctly at the moment.

It can in some cases also reference persons, places, or moments in time.  **The proposed feature:** Add functionality to cite webpages, on-line articles, or blog posts.  Once it is possible open urls with signal (7310) and display citations (6017); 1. a.   Allow for messages to contain a preview image of the cited article or webpage, based on meta-data provided on that web-page.     b.  Allow for preview images to be clickable, bringing the user to the referenced URL.     c.  If the message contains multiple URL's, it must be visually clear which one the preview belongs to. 2. Allow for messages to contain a header/title of the referenced article, based on metadata. 3. a.  Allow for messages to contain an URL to the cited webpage.     b.  Due to the importance of privacy, preferably do not shorten the URL, like some other apps do. Instead allow the user to see where the link takes him before cliking it. 5. Locations or moments in time may be useful to a calander function. This is currently of no use in Signal Private messenger, but should be kept in mind if future versions do have use for such meta-data. 6. Provide documentation for web-developers on the desired file-size, aspect-ratio and minimum resolution of preview images, the acceptable length of header or titels, and the manner in which meta-data must be provided. Signal does not need to be as strickt on this as a platform such as Twitter is, but it is best practice to be clear on this right from the start,, as Signal may be used in a professional environment in the future. Especially with meta-data, the rules and recommandations should be clear from day one.   I have deliberatly split these out so each detail can be easily discussed. It wouldn't be practical to split them all into seperate tickets as they are details to the same functionality.  Fetching information from web locations will obviously need to be done very carefully, as it brings in numerous privacy concerns. Where a privacy friendly solution cannot be found, certain features could be optional, with a clear warning that it cannot be used without privacy concerns. Hopefull we can find solutions and wont have to make anything optional or leave anything out.","closed","feature,","Meteor0id","2018-02-22T21:19:46Z","2018-04-03T05:03:25Z"

Previously, it was being stripped from most images by our re-scaling process. However, smaller images would slip through and keep their metadata, possibly exposing things like photo location.   This PR removes all EXIF metadata by re-encoding the JPEG. This keeps all of the visual effects of the EXIF tags (like orientation) by updating the image data itself, while removing all EXIF tags.  Fixes #5968  **Test Cases** * Sending a small JPEG (that doesn't get resized) with lots of metadata, including orientation * Sending a small JPEG (that doesn't get resized) with lots of metadata, excluding orientation * Sending a large JPEG (that does get resized) * Sending a JPEG with no metadata * Sending a GIF * Sending a PNG  **Metadata Verification Process** * Used the [Photo Exif Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.xnano.android.photoexifeditor&hl=en) app to view image metadata. * Verified that if the image was rendering in the proper orientation (in both the thumbnail and the preview).  **Test Image** ![cat-rotated](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37311915/37608388-a705b748-2b57-11e8-8df5-9517f6ba28cf.jpg) (Hilariously, the orientation field is not respected in my browser in the thumbnail, but it _is_ respected if you click the image and view it fullscreen).  **Things I Still Need to Test** - [x] MMS messages - [x] Group messages  **Test Devices** * [Moto X (2nd Generation), Android 6.0](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php) * [Galaxy S3 Mini, Andoid 4.2.2](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i8200_galaxy_s_iii_mini_ve-6190.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-03-19T16:43:28Z","2018-03-29T22:46:23Z"

This is done by using SQLite's full-text search feature.  [Demo Video](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/1929639/fts.zip) _Note: Clicking ""load full conversation"" takes ~5s in the video because the conversation is approximately 37,000 messages long. Load time tends to scale roughly linearly, so conversations with ~18,500 messages complete in a little under 2.5 seconds on this 2014 mid-tier phone (Moto X 2nd Gen)._  While implementing this feature, I took the opportunity to bring in some of the new [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html), specifically ViewModels. The search feature has been split into appropriate View, ViewModel, and Repository layers, and the plan is to continue doing this where appropriate when adding new features.  Finally, getting search to be performant involved coordinating with the SQLCipher team to make some changes to how cursors are filled. These changes have not yet been merged in yet, and therefore I've tagged this PR as ""do not merge"" until we have the new SQLCipher library tested and integrated.  In addition to those changes, to further improve performance I made is so that if you jump to an old enough message, we only load 500 neighboring messages (same as we do when loading a conversation from the bottom). That means you can see the ""load more messages"" banner on both the top and bottom of the list.

I once again request that Signal be added to F-Droid.  I also feel reopening the dialogue a year later has real value.  - Moxie is correct in stating that a download from play is easier than the harrowing process of enabling third party repos in Android.  This request is for more security minded users and establishes a ""post google"" path forward.    - #127 Moxie outlined a very reasonable list of requests for F-Droid and his 2013 sentiments on the security of the platform were well founded.  F-Droid now allows to distribute a developer-signed version of the app, if the build is reproducable by their build server, and F-Droid now allows installation of apps without enabling third-party support.    - FDroid allows opt-in bug reporting.  - F-Droid receives annual security audits from neutral partners and publishes the results. https://www.f-droid.org/en/2018/01/20/upcoming-security-audit.html  - Moxie was kind enough to provide https://signal.org/android/apk/ in 2017 but as the ""Danger Zone"" implies, this is textbook sub-optimal distribution no better than Google Play.    Why we need Signal in FDroid - Google has been a member of the PRISM program for 9 years.  The fact that it joined the program at all is more than enough reason to reassess it as the sole provider of Signal. - Arab Spring events have proven the big 3 (google, facebook, twitter) all go predictably dark.

Also, because the way we show images has changed a bit, I've wrapped `ThumbnailView` into a class `ConversationItemThumbnail` so we can render the `ConversationItemFooter` and timestamp background shade without making `ThumbnailView` overly-specific.  **Test Devices** * [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php) * [Galaxy S3 Mini, Android 4.2.2.

Then it crashes immediately after each attempt to start it.  Steps to reproduce: - Backup data in 4.19.3 installed from play store through Settings->chats and media->create backup (and wait for the backup process to complete), - unistall the app - switch to beta testing in play store - install beta version (4.20.4), let it to restore data from backup - app crashes.  **Device:** Samsung SM-J330F **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.20.4  Debug log can't be created for obvious reasons.  My guess (without actually looking into the code): The app is not validating restored data and handles exceptions poorly, so when restoring process goes wrong, the app just crashes without reporting any error to the user and then it keeps crashing and crashing..","closed","","taturati","2018-05-29T19:24:13Z","2018-06-08T05:41:23Z"

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Explanation for issues of type ""ExtraTranslation"":    If a string appears in a specific language translation file, but there is    no corresponding string in the default locale, then this string is probably    unused. (It's technically possible that your application is only intended    to run in a specific locale, but it's still a good idea to provide a    fallback.).     Note that these strings can lead to crashes if the string is looked up on    any locale not providing a translation, so it's important to clean them    up. ```","closed","","johanw666","2018-08-06T22:44:41Z","2019-03-03T10:18:21Z"
"","8298","Fix camera scaling issues on some phones.","Some phones, notably the Pixel 3, had some problems with scaling after taking photos. This fixes it by  using the takePicture API instead of pulling the bitmap from the TextureView.

Problem is newest version of Signal has gotten rid of the passphrase in favor of forcing everyone to use a fingerprint for the screenlock. Now no one is able to set their own passwords anymore! Why this change?   Stranger still, there is now suddenly a mysterious retroactive flip-flop akin to the ""Mandela Effect"" whereby now the developer of Signal wants us all to beLIEve that it has always been the case that Signal never offered true ""end to end encryption"" at rest, and that the passphrase for the signal app was never anything more than a useless ""screenlock""... When other users pointed out the blatant inconsistency in this regard, the developer promptly closed and then LOCKED the topic/issue at hand.   However, recall that not long ago Signal was praised by many as the only IM app that offers true end to end encryption at rest!   https://theintercept.com/2016/06/22/battle-of-the-secure-messaging-apps-how-signal-beats-whatsapp/ http://archive.is/jXFgP  To quote the Intercept article/review of Signal app in relevant part:  """"Finally, online backups are a gaping hole in the security of WhatsApp messages. End-to-end encryption only refers to how messages are encrypted when they’re sent over the internet, not while they’re stored on your phone. Once messages are on your phone, they rely on your phone’s built-in encryption to keep them safe (which is why it’s important to use a strong passcode). If you choose to back up your phone to the cloud — such as to your Google account if you’re an Android user or your iCloud account if you’re an iPhone user — then you’re handing the content of your messages to your backup service provider.  By default, WhatsApp stores its messages in a way that allows them to be backed up to the cloud by iOS or Android. If you back up your phone to your Google or iCloud account, Signal doesn’t include any of your messages in this backup. WhatsApp’s gaping backup issue simply doesn’t exist with Signal, and there’s no risk of accidentally handing over your private messages to any third-party company.

This passphrase will be used to encrypt all of Signal's secret information, including the keys used to encrypt your text messages. The security of your messages depends on the strength of this passphrase, so make it good. Signal can be configured to cache this passphrase in memory for as long as its running, or for a specific length of time, so you won't need to be constantly re-entering it in order to access or send messages. This passphrase cannot be recovered if it is lost."" and ""All text messages are encrypted with your passphrase before being stored.

Now, after the change, fingerprints will be forced to be used for all security in place of the passphrase.

I am using the official Signal APK from https://signal.org/android/apk/, so not Noise or anything like that.  For months now, Signal on Android’s network connection seems to “freeze” sporadically (once or twice per day), leaving it unable to send or receive any messages (even things like read confirmations) for long periods of time. During this time, messages can be sent and received from the Signal desktop client normally and without any delay, but none of these messages show up in the Android client. It does not make a difference whether the Android client is open or any conversations are opened – nothing happens.  It seems that Signal can be made “un-stuck” by resetting the phone’s network connection (e. g. disabling WiFi so that the phone switches to cellular data) or using “force stop” to kill and restart the Signal Android client completely. Upon one of these events, all of the messages from the intervening time period will appear in the Android client all at once.  ### Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, since this seems to happen erratically, concrete steps to reproduce are a bit difficult to determine. - Use the phone normally (not sure if longer periods of inactivity are required). - Have someone else send you a message and/or send messages yourself from the Signal desktop client.  **Actual result:** No new messages (sent or received) are displayed in the Signal Android app, even if it is open. This occurs when the phone and the desktop are on the same WiFi network, so the issue is not due to poor connectivity. **Expected result:** Messages should appear immediately in the Signal Android client.  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus One **Android version:** 7.1.2 (LineageOS 14.1). I have never had Google Play services installed and Android Doze is disabled (“Battery optimization: Not optimized”) for Signal. **Signal version:** 4.17.5 (but I’ve been having this issue for months now, so includes many earlier versions)  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b1f29ef755a08091528fefff299057d9  At 15:25, my phone switched to cellular data (because I went out of WiFi range). At that point, all the messages from the last hour or so appeared all at once.  This debug log was taken with Signal version 4.15.5, but the issue still occurs with the latest version (4.17.5).","closed","help wanted,","Socob","2018-04-04T22:20:31Z","2021-04-27T21:38:16Z"

"","7894","Upgrade SQLCipher to respect a max window size.","Previously, SQLCipher's memory usage would grow indefinitely, up until it hit the end of the cursor. This leaves us open to OOM errors on large datasets. We've now switched to a release where the memory used by the cursor can be bounded.  Performance seems largely unaffected. Basic query times appear to be the same on my 2014 Moto E. The main difference is that because there's a memory ceiling on a cursor, if it hits that memory ceiling, it has to requery and refill the cursor window.   On a conversation with 18,500 messages (again, on my 2014 Moto E), this takes just under 1 second. Because the cursor is refilled on the main thread, that means the UI has a very noticeable ""hiccup"". However, I only experienced this hiccup when I set the memory ceiling very low (128 KB). At it's current value of 4MB, this hiccup should only be hit every 5000 messages or so (all depending on the message size, of course). On my 2016 Pixel, this hiccup is only ~250ms.  That said, while I think the hiccup is an acceptable compromise to avoid OOM errors on large conversations, it'd still be a good idea in the future to make some architectural changes to avoid the main-thread-requery pattern that is common with cursors.  **Test Devices** * [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php) * [Google Pixel, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel-8346.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-06-12T17:00:08Z","2018-06-13T16:12:46Z"

"","8193","Messages from starred contacts don't notify during ""Do Not Disturb""","On Android 9 Pie, on a Google Pixel XL, and when using Do Not Disturb (with starred contacts set to bypass Do Not Disturb), I find that Signal messages from starred contacts do not properly notify, and are instead silent. Contrasting this behavior to calls, and SMS/MMS received in other apps, like Hangouts (as we use Fi with Hangouts for SMS), or Messages (as the SMS app), or with incoming calls, with all of those applications, sounds and vibration happen when calls or messages are incoming from previously starred contacts.  I know that it is possible to globally allow Signal to override DND from the notifications area in the App Settings (in Android Settings), however, I'd like only my starred contacts to override, vs all Signal notifications. It seems this behavior is not properly obeying my Starred Contacts settings.  In truth, I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature. Does Signal leverage the DND Access API?  Please let me know if more information is needed, and I haven't tested this behavior on earlier versions of Android to deteremine if this is a regression, but I potentially can (as I have a Nexus 5, a Nexus 6, a Nexus 6p, a Nexus 7 2013, and a Nexus 9, even though tablet support doesn't exist).

This also happens in some cases in the main chat UI itself, I'm specifically not sure when. I'l let you know if I could reproduce the latter but the former occurs consistently.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use a small screen (width-wise) device (~ 4.2"", 480 x 800 pixels) - For a message from a Signal user, use quick reply - Long-press on a message in the chat history  **Actual result:** The ""Reply to message"" icon is only partially visible and is mostly inaccessible. **Expected result:** The ""Reply to message"" icons should be accessible regardless of screen size.  ### Screenshots ![inaccesible-reply-to-message-signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448084/46435612-5fab5d80-c774-11e8-92a7-589a341d7f39.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy J1 ace **Android version:** 5.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.27.3   ### Link to debug log Possibly not required.  ### Possibly related #7846.

It currently requires a very commonly used unlock method and credentials instead of a unique unlock method or credentials. (Off topic/rant: Likely, the developers themselves are bugged. It's obvious they do not understand security protocol. By making an rarely used item (signal database encryption) have the exact same unlock method and credentials as a highly used item (a phone) they have shown that they, either, have received money or threats to make it easier to social engineer the unlock method or that they have absolutely no idea regarding how to resist social engineering of unlock credentials in the real world.)  ### Steps to reproduce Observe past and current changes to unlock method. Attempt to use unique method to secure signal database  **Actual result:** It's extremely easy to social engineer the current unlock method by observing the very common method to access a phone  **Expected result:** It's extremely difficult to social engineer the correct unlock method because both the phone and the database should have different unlocking credentials","closed","","avastar","2018-08-02T16:01:27Z","2018-08-02T20:03:27Z"

"","8091","Switch to WorkManager.","In preparation for the pending `targetSdk 26` requirement, we're changing `JobScheduler` to use the new `WorkManager` to execute tasks. The existing JobScheduler interface has been kept as close as possible to the original to reduce the amount of code changes. here's a general outline of the code changes.  - Changed `Job` to subclass the new `Worker` class. - Job now essentially does what `JobConsumer` used to do -- i.e. it runs an `onRun()` method and returns the proper value (`SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RETRY`) based on whether or not certain exceptions are thrown. This let's us keep all subclasses of `Job` identical, save the next step: - Because WorkManager requires all data be persisted via a `Data` object, two methods have been added to Job: `serialize()` and `initialize()`. These methods are responsible for saving and restoring instance state. So really, the largest changes in this diff come from having to do that for every job. - WorkManager also requires that every `Worker` subclass have a no-arg constructor, so one has been added to every job. - We migrate all outstanding persisted Jobs to run on the new JobManager after app upgrade. Our reliance of java serialization for persistence means that we unfortunately have to carry around all of our existing Requirement classes for the foreseeable future, even though we don't use them anymore (outside of migration). - To prevent the use of any new Requirements (which could only actually work if they're manually persisted in the data bundle, which I've done for the existing ones), I've removed them from JobParameters, instead using named setters for the requirements we already have. - Had to update our compileSdk to 28 to get WorkManager to work.   - Also had to update all of our support library versions  **Test Devices** * [Moto E (2nd Gen), Android 5.1, API 22](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php) * [Nexus 5X, Android 8.1, API 27](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5x-7556.php) * [Moto X (2nd Gen), Android 7.1, API 25](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php) * Android 9 Emulator under various network conditions","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-08-09T16:37:56Z","2018-09-28T20:56:15Z"

"","7873","Bug: Signal is over-requesting the storage permission","In light of the recent [HTML parsing bugs](https://thehackernews.com/2018/05/signal-desktop-hacking.html) for the Desktop app and [associated controversies](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/1635) relating to Signal's security, I was thinking about the [runtime permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting) in the Android app and whether or not they may be over-requested.  I'm thinking particularly about the [storage write](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml#L38) [permission](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/permissions/Permissions.java).  A best security practice would be to request only the minimal set of permissions needed and no more.  The problem with asking for unlimited access to write anywhere in storage is that it is simply not needed in many situations.  To paraphrase, well, [myself](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36348396/3035127):  > For reading and/or writing a file, *there is actually a way to completely avoid having to ask for and then check for the permission* and thus bypass the whole request.  The solution, which I believe works in API 19+, eliminates the need for the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission by having a  `DocumentsProvider` act as a ""middleman"" to basically ask the user on your app's behalf ""please select the specific file to write to"" (ie, a ""file picker"") and then once the user chooses a file (or types in a new file name), the app is now magically granted permission to do so for that Uri, since the user has specifically granted it. > >No ""official"" `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission needed. > >This way of kind of borrowing permissions is part of the [Storage Access Framework][1], and a discussion about this was made at the Big Android BBQ by Ian Lake.  [Here's a video][2] called **Forget the Storage Permission: Alternatives for sharing and collaborating** that goes over the basics and how you specifically use it to bypass the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission requirement entirely.  In other words, the user can grant a temporary permission **for a single file** (or in API 21, a [folder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE)) and never have to be explicitly asked to grant the full app-level storage permission.  When Signal sends a file, this would be done automatically (since you already select the file to send).  When receiving a file and wanting to save it to a particular directory, the target directory & filename can similarly be selected by the user and the one-use permission would be granted to save the file without ever needing to request/grant the full app permission.  [These limited-time permission-grants can optionally be persisted across system restarts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider#permissions) *or* abandoned, say, once the file is saved and now the permission is no longer needed.  The advantage here is to stop Signal from being able to access *any* file or folder across all storage devices (local+cloud) in case there is some future vulnerability that might allow exposure to all accessible files (similar to what happened w/ the Desktop app).  Why ask for a broad permission you don't really need?  If some kind of bug ever let an attacker remotely access the Signal device's storage systems, the damage could be contained considerably.  Incidentally, Signal also requests the storage write permission just to access images-- but the SAF allows you to select images from any [DocumentsProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/DocumentsProvider) (such as the gallery or other image providers) *without* needing the storage permission-- just [filter to narrow the request by MIME type](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider#flow).  I'm just throwing this out there for discussion.  Obviously the old mechanism would still need to be available for APIs prior to the Storage Access Framework becoming available.  But for running Signal on Android and more and more on Chrome OS, a user probably shouldn't give the app access beyond the narrowest scope in which it's needed.   Cheers!

The only answer to this request was the following:  > **There is an option to turn off notifications while in the chat.** ""Settings->Notifications->In-chat sounds"" and just turn that off.     I think the main problem of this solution is, that when turning off the sounds completely while in chat, you have to look at the screen continuously.  A lot of peopleI am trying to convince to use Signal (me included) have the following Problem:  While writing with someone, they have their screen on and are in-chat but not looking at the screen all the time. So they often miss new answer so 1-2 minutes and the conversation gets stuck.  **So, again the same request: Fully silencing the notification sound while in the chat doesn't fix the problem adequate.

While using it to talk with my children who are in various time zones, I rarely think first about what time it is for them. I just begin writing whatever I think is important. Maybe it could wait till they wake up but I don't think they're sleeping because I'm not.  I know this is a difficult feature to do right because there are so many ways to do it. I have peoples location in my contacts list that the app pulls from, but that would mean Signal would have to do a lookup on the person by the city, state, zip each time it opens the conversation. That would be wrong if they were traveling. I can't ask my app to ask their app what time it is there (at least I don't think it can). If the person does use Signal, the app could just always look at the time zone the person is in and display it on the other app's messages whenever they're in different timezones, unless a conversant is trying to hide that information from others.   If you could pull it off, there are so many cool ways to display that piece of info. A simple am/pm clock, a red background during typical sleeping hours, a sun to moon icon representing the angle of the sun for the other person.   A catchy item like this may get my iPhone addicted daughter to try Signal instead of whatever crap she's using now.","closed","","WNYmathGuy","2018-07-19T17:53:19Z","2018-07-19T19:02:05Z"

In that situation if Signal stores multiple copies of the image in each distinct message thread, it wastes a lot of space. The way around this would be to store images once and have them reference counted. Each time an image in a message thread is deleted, its unreferenced. When it hits zero its actually deleted from storage.","closed","","kiplingw","2018-07-27T22:50:34Z","2018-08-02T19:29:08Z"

It was not possible to install Signal while Noise was still installed, needless to say Noise created a broken backup so I'm stuck with all my (important) messages contained in a broken backup.  While restoring the messages Signal crashes:  [debug.log](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/2212342/debug.log)  I understand the SQL statements are broken (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/7f7aab044cc6ca2989c3f949c7dbeff13ec39dd6), so guess I need to find a way to fix them. As far as I understand it I have now two options: * [proper fix] Fix the parser so that it does not choke on broken backups, (even a partial restore where broken messages are discarded is way better than no messages at all). * [workaround] Decrypt my backup and fix the SQL manually, I looked into this but it seems Signal uses it's own encryption format for the file so then I would have to build a tool that can decrypt and encrypt the file so at this point it seems easier to try to use the application in order to work on the file.   My backup is 900mb, and needless to say I cannot post it. It always fails on the same message and it looks like most messages work.  The log indicates that backup.FullBackupImporter.trimEntriesForExpiredMessages causes the problem, so I'll start looking at this function to try to figure out how it can be fixed or at least improved to work around the problem.  Any help appreciated for how to fix it, I don't think I'm the only one with this problem as Noise expired today.","closed","backup,","JKAbrams","2018-07-20T04:40:55Z","2019-06-03T18:46:13Z"

If I got it right, then the described vulnerability is as follows: The Signal client doesn't authenticate messages that add new members to a group. So if the Group ID (impossible to guess, but known to the server) and *one* group member are known to the attacker, then she can send a group joining message to this contact and gets joined without further authentication.  I'm aware of Moxies response [Here's how WhatsApp group messaging works](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16117487) but I'm not aware of a public statement by any of the OpenWhispersystems/Signal developers regarding the evaluation of *Signal* group messaging by the paper.  My understanding is, that in Signal there would be a fairly easy fix for the described vulnerability: the Signal client could check whether the group joining request comes from an *existing* member of the group and deny the joining attempt if not.  Do you intend to implement this fix in Signal? If not, what's the rationale to not do so?","closed","","mejo-","2018-01-17T10:57:54Z","2018-01-19T18:34:48Z"

Furthermore, Conversations colors every previous plaintext message red. I've noticed Signal colors messages from non-signal-users grey. However, they get colored once they join Signal. The lock at the message bottom isn't visually obvious enough in my personal opinion.

It seems to be caused by a single quote in the text I got from a friend.  Seems similar to #7491, I had that one too on 4.17.0, but now I'm facing this one.  Seems exactly like #7488, but that got opened in 4.17.0 and closed as resolved in 4.17.1, which seems not to be true.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a text with a single quote - Create a backup - Clear app data/cache - Start Signal and try to restore from backup  **Actual result:** Signals crashes **Expected result:** Signal should restore the whole backup  ### Device info **Device:** motorola Moto C (namath_54) **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.17.1  ### Debug log `Device : motorola Moto C (namath_54) Android : 7.0 (1505098634, NRD90M.005) Memory : 17M (8.54% free, 256M max) Memclass: 128 OS Host : dell-PowerEdge-R730 App : Signal 4.17.1  --------- beginning of main  03-11 19:34:00.700 31230 32089 E MPlugin : Unsupported class: com.mediatek.common.telephony.IOnlyOwnerSimSupport  03-11 19:38:06.107 32233 32233 E MPlugin : Unsupported class: com.mediatek.common.telephony.IOnlyOwnerSimSupport  03-11 20:06:24.488 32233 369 E MPlugin : Unsupported class: com.mediatek.common.telephony.IOnlyOwnerSimSupport  03-11 20:09:22.049 945 945 E MPlugin : Unsupported class: com.mediatek.common.telephony.IOnlyOwnerSimSupport  03-11 20:09:24.018 945 945 E MPlugin : Unsupported class: com.mediatek.common.telephony.IOnlyOwnerSimSupport  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: AsyncTask #5  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 945  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.RuntimeException: An error occurred while executing doInBackground()  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at android.os.AsyncTask$3.done(AsyncTask.java:318)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.finishCompletion(FutureTask.java:354)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.setException(FutureTask.java:223)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:242)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at android.os.AsyncTask$SerialExecutor$1.run(AsyncTask.java:243)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1133)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:607)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:761)  03-11 20:11:02.646 945 1015 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteException: near ""ie"": syntax error: INSERT INTO sms VALUES (377,7,'+*********00',1,NULL,1465975641779,1465975641779,0,1,-1,20,NULL,0,NULL,'[censored] NIN\'ie -

Naturally, this results in a gesture slightly diagonal (e.g. from bottom left to top right and vice versa for the right hand) rather than exactly horizontal. The gesture detection fails in this case, since it seems to expect a nearly horizontal move, which is nearly impossible to accomplish in one-hand-usage. Hence, the gesture detection should be more ""liberal"", if the move direction isn't absolutely accurate. Besides of that, a full screen mode (that can be toggled) would fit in fairly nice.  ### Steps to reproduce - open media preview gallery - hold phone in one hand and try to use that hand's thumb to swipe left/right  **Actual result:** Gesture detection most often fails to recognize, user gets frustrated **Expected result:** Gesture detection succeeds to recognize and shows previous/next media  ### Device info **Device:** Lenovo Moto G 4 Plus (other devices as well) **Android version:** 7.0 (Android 4.4 as well) **Signal version:** 4.15.0  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/4ad7a55db59d9c7c09d8d93b7287e481","closed","","PiCob","2018-01-10T03:33:23Z","2018-01-16T02:17:50Z"

This results in me missing MMS texts for many hours, if not days, when using Signal as the default messenger app.  ### Steps to reproduce - Turn off data - Send MMS via another phone or email - No notification  **Actual result:** There are no notifications for MMS messages when data is off.  **Expected result:** If I enter the conversation, I can see Signal knows there is a MMS message waiting. It cannot retrieve it, which is fine, but I would expect that since Signal knows about the message, it could notify users who have their data turned off. Something like ""Hey, dingdong! You have a message waiting. Turn on data to retrieve."" This is how all other messaging apps handle the situation. I don't need it to automatically turn on data and retrieve (although that would be cool, too), but I do need something better than ""just turn data on"" (which I'm sure will be the hack that someone would recommend; I don't want, need, or desire data to always be on).  ### Device info  **Device:** Asus ZenFone 2 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.14.10","closed","mms,","patrickmollohan","2018-01-20T21:09:48Z","2018-04-03T04:55:14Z"

However, if the call is answered manually on the screen, the bluetooth set engages automatically and works.  Even more surprisingly, pressing the multifunction button while a Signal call is in progress (and the BT set in use) has the effect of disengaging the BT headset - and handing the call over to the regular speaker- rather than ending the call.    The same issue occurs on Pixel 2 (stock) and on Nexus 5 (LineageOS).   ### Steps to reproduce - receive a Signal call, having a bluetooth headset paired and connected - try to answer the call from the bluetooth headset   **Actual result:** The call keeps ringing. It can be picked up from the screen but not from the bluetooth button. When the call is answered manually, however, the bluetooth set works fine.  **Expected result:** Pressing the bluetooth button while a Signal call is ringing answers the Signal call, similar to how pressing it while a regular phone call is ringing answers the call.    - while on a Signal call and speaking through a bluetooth headset  - try to hang up by pressing the button on the headset   **Actual result:** The call does not end, but the bluetooth toggle gets disengaged and the call is transfered to the regular speaker.   **Expected result:** Pressing the bluetooth button while on a Signal call ends the call, just as it hangs up in a regular phone call.   ### Screenshots Not relevant   ### Device info **Bluetooth headset:** Aukey EP-B40 Bluetooth 4.1 **Device 1:** Google Pixel 2 **Android version:** Stock Android 8.1.0 - OPM1.171019.013 **Signal version:** 4.15.5 **Device 2:** Google Nexus 5 **Android version:** LineageOS 14.1.2 - NJH47F (no root) **Signal version:** 4.15.5  ### Link to debug log  Trying to pick up a Signal call by pressing the bluetooth button (nothing happens) https://gist.github.com/1dc59631a8efd0bc26ea9a98808c039f  Trying to end a Signal call by pressing the bluetooth button (Bluetooth disengages, but call continues on speaker) https://gist.github.com/b2cc2ed5bc3a97e443f1179a62e45fe0","closed","","cegg1","2018-01-31T20:31:38Z","2018-04-03T05:07:10Z"

"","7319","Out-of-date prekeys","I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description This issue contains various examples for badly encrypted messages which are per @scottnonnenberg most likely caused by a Signal Android bug that produces out-of-date prekeys.  For the full discussion including Scott's comments, see here: https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop/issues/1930  **Example 1:**  One of those cases is decribed in [issue 7154](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/issues/7154), and as ""luck"" has it, I've just experienced this again a couple of minutes ago.  My Android device and Signal Desktop had been successfully linked for several months now, but as I switched to a newly set up installation of Windows, I had to install Sigal Desktop again and re-link it to my phone.  So what I've done is  1. Installed Signal Desktop v1.1 on Windows 2. Deleted the the old link (from the prior Windows installation) from Signal Android 3. Went through the linking procedure on Signal Desktop & Signal Android (scanning QR code, etc)  And bam - I've received 2 badly encrypted messages from my own phone number on Signal Android. As expected, Signal Desktop didn't sync anything. It looks finished, but there are no contacts available.  I haven't done so yet, but I know from experience that I can remedy this situation by resetting the secure session with my own phone number. [I later did, and resetting the secure fixed the problem]  **Example 2:**  I have a friend with whom I've successfully communicated via Signal Android & Desktop (me) & iOS (him) for many months. But a week or so ago, I've installed and configured Signal Desktop (v1.1) on his notebook for the very first time. At first, all seemed well.  But from that very point in time on, I suddenly only received badly encrypted messages from him. Namely I received only badly encrypted messages from him independently from the device he was using. I've received badly encrypted messages from him when he used his newly installed Signal Desktop, and I've received badly encrypted messages from him when he was using Signal iOS (which used to work without problems before linking it to Signal Desktop).  Interestingly, this only happened when he communicated with me, but not when he communicated with other contacts.  Again, I've had to reset the secure session with him AND send him a message afterwards (only resetting didn't do the trick) in order to fix it.  So I've definitely had my share of issues that could only be fixed by resetting the secure session. I've had this happen on completely different devices and addtionally, I've done clean installs of Signal on a fairly regular basis, so it's not some fucked up installation. ~~My guess is that Signal Desktop is somehow bugged in that regard.~~  *Update 2018-01-03*  **Example 3:**  A contact of mine installed & set up Signal Android for the very first time (in her life) and directly after that sent me a message (also her very first Signal message to anyone ever). I've received that message as badly encrypted on Signal Android, **but it is readable on Signal Desktop**.

"","7368","Signal No Longer Recognizes Android Contacts","I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description The Signal application (version 4.14.x and higher) no longer recognizes any Android contacts on Sailfish devices that employ Alien Dalvik.  All previous versions worked fine.  All Signal messages and basic conversation features work, but there is no visible association with contacts, so no names or pictures appear.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Android support on Sailfish device (Sailfish version 2.1.3.7) - Install Signal Android application (tested with 4.14.10 and 4.15.5) - Open application and notice that all current conversations have ""#"" as contact image, as well as no names.   **Actual result:** All current conversations have ""#"" as contact image, as well as no names.  Also, the new message screen is unable to display any available contacts.  If an attempt is made to add a Contact from an existing conversation, the following message appears: ""There is no app available to handle this link on your device."" **Expected result:** The Signal application should be able to interrogate the Android subsystem to automatically import contacts.  At the very least, starting a new message conversation and selecting the ""..."" -> ""Refresh"" menu should import contacts and associate them with existing conversations.    This unexpected behavior is not present with version 4.12.3 (downgrading solves the issue).  However, the older version will ""expire"" and is therefore not tenable as a long-term solution.  ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia X **Android version:** 4.4.4 **Signal version:** 4.15.5  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/29fa6a5dde054e02826ecab128e16534  I understand from reading several other bug reports that @moxie0 is not interested in supporting Sailfish or other non-pure Android environments.  I also have read several of his comments lamenting the current ""broken state"" of PC security (and security overall).  Many of his laudable efforts have improved security greatly for many people around the world.  However, I propose that not supporting Sailfish (and/or Alien Dalvik) while claiming to champion privacy and security are two opposing positions that do not comport.  Having an alternative platform, free from corporate spying and other unsavory anti-privacy features, are essential to those wishing for improved privacy and security.  The Sailfish platform, while imperfect, provides a ""third way"" for the security conscious.  I understand that a great deal of resources cannot be committed to this tiny - *perhaps* *insignificant* - subset of devices in a sea of Android devices awash with greatly diverse hardware and versions, but I ask that serious consideration be given to ensuring that basic Signal functionality is possible on the Sailfish platform.

"","7375","Signal calls get stuck ""connecting"" when received on / made from a Google Pixel 2","I have: - [X] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Signal calls often get stuck ""connecting"" and do not get established on the Pixel 2. This does not happen on a Nexus 5 under similar network conditions. ~~I suspect the issue is related to the Pixel 2.~~ (Update: as it turns out, the issue resembles #7396 on Samsung Galaxy S4 and #7211 on Galaxy S5). It keeps happening over time on different networks. The network has been tested (see below) and no problems are suspected.  Signal text messages remain unaffected, even when a call cannot be established between the devices, messages go through and lost call notifications arrive too.   UPDATE:  **Relay Signal Calls** Using ""always relay calls"" through the Signal server does **not** make any difference.   **WiFi**  The chances of getting a call established seem to be better when on WiFi than on a cellular network, but again, much less than 100% of the time.   **WhatsApp**  WhatsApp works fine on the same devices under the same conditions and networks. Calls connect 100% of the time. IMHO if WhatsApp can connect but Signal cannot with or without server relay, this rules out network issues.   **VoLTE / LTE-A** Native VoLTE is enabled on the Pixel 2 and I cannot turn it off. I cannot test if native VoLTE interferes with Signal because the setting to turn off VoLTE does not stick. Neither can I turn off carrier aggregation because the LTE-A toggle is grayed out in the enabled position. Nevertheless, the same issues occur on 3G and EDGE so I think it is unlikely that VoLTE or LTE-A 3CA interfere with Signal calls.   **Battery Optimizations**  Turning off battery optimizations (doze) for the Signal app seems to **improve** the chances of establishing a call, but short of a 100% success rate.   Could this issue be somehow related to battery optimizations in Android 8.1? Or perhaps related to #7327 in how Signal manages network connections?   ### Steps to reproduce - make a Signal call to a Pixel 2 from another phone - ~~the call gets established less than 50% of the time~~  - The chance of getting a call established is around 10-15%. If you keep trying many times it eventually connects. But most often it happens as follows:  **Actual result:** The phone does not ring. But a Signal notification appears that says ""Connecting..."", together with a phone icon on the notification bar. The phone never rings but sometimes it stops ""connecting"" when the caller hangs up.

Switching cameras (front/rear camera), rotating back to the previous orientation, or closing and reopening Quick Capture makes it functional again.

Kudos and thanks for that.  However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way.  ### Steps to reproduce - save an item - save it again - you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end - save it again - you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item - repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving  **Expected result:** Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this.  Thanks in advance.","closed","feature,","GuardianMajor","2018-01-16T22:56:03Z","2018-04-03T04:55:25Z"

Ordinarily I would blame this piece of shit phone, but my friend has a Nexus 6P and she has the same issue.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Send a video that is .mp4, .webm or .mpeg from Signal-Android or Signal-Desktop, it doesn't make a difference. Here are three videos you can try it with: https://u.teknik.io/IIrt3.zip The video with the cat in the box was sent to me as a .mpeg but I changed it to .mp4, but it doesn't make a difference. **I can't even watch videos recorded on my own phone!** However, the thumbnail still shows in the chat so... That's something? 2. Wait for the video to download onto Signal-Android or wait for it to send 3. Click the video 4. The video is forever black.  **Actual result:** Most, but not all videos, fail to play **Expected result:** Almost every video should play flawlessly, I first noticed the issue just now after it came back from repairs (took 2 weeks) but my Nexus buddy says it's longer than that.   ### Device info Moto G4 with 7.0.1, Signal 4.16.6.

I'm guessing, from the timeline of events, that this is due to the database migration. Here's what happened, near as I can tell.  1. Sometime during the night, Signal updated to the new beta 4.16.3 1. Later, a contact messaged me in Signal twice. The first was just text, the second was an image. 1. Even later, when I woke up in the morning, I saw I had a message and opened Signal. It performed a database migration first thing. 1. I now have two threads for this contact (before, I only had one). The thread that contained the new message was incorrect (this thread was to a different person and not a group chat), and was a really old, archived SMS thread with another contact many months ago. (You can also tell this via the colors in the screenshot.)  #### Other things I've noticed after this bug occurred - Viewing ""All Media"" in either thread now only displays the new image I received last night. Scrolling through the correct thread, there are still plenty of images that should be displaying. Yet again, this bug seems to be regulated to just the one contact; other threads display All Media correctly. - I responded to the contact in the correct thread, and the reply came in the *incorrect* thread. It is not displayed at all in the correct thread. - Other contacts seem to be working fine so far. The only one that is broken is the one that messaged me after the upgrade, but before the DB migration.   **Actual result:** Contact's messages appearing in wrong thread, media in correct thread now longer showing in All Media **Expected result:** Contact's messages appear in the correct thread, and all media displays the correct amount of media.  ### Screenshots ![screenshot_20180203-070911](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479099/35771792-746149fc-0900-11e8-8975-2f57aba3b026.png)    ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel XL (Marlin) **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.16.3  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/5a29ff88469a898ab617445659067a76","closed","","TheCraiggers","2018-02-03T21:46:01Z","2018-02-26T17:57:30Z"

This is done through a hardware abstraction layer that uses the so-called ""Pixel Visual Core"" chip. WhatsApp and other apps are already using this in their built-in cameras to seamlessly take HDR+ pictures.  Thus, enabling hardware-accelerated HDR+ pictures on Signal appears to be straightforward.

PLEASE use variable in original english string instead of fixed number 1. Or at least allow us to replace fixed number 1 with variable %d. In croatian, other slavic languages (and probably others around world) plural type ""one"" as defined in android is used for numbers 1, 21, 31, 41, 51, etc. So I can't just use 1, when same string will be used also for 21. You can find more info on Mozilla localization site: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_and_Plurals Islandic, all slavic languages (Russian, Ukraine, Belarus...), almost all Celtic languages etc., all those use plural rule ONE for more then just number 1.","closed","","RiseT","2018-03-08T12:52:07Z","2018-03-12T00:05:27Z"

Australian numbers begin with +61. I miss a call in the US, the number shown is eg, ""1 949 123 4567"" (note: not ""+1"") On the missed-call (in the dialer app), I choose ""reply with txt message"", and it opens Signal to compose a txt message to that number, except signal instead decides to use ""+61 1 949 123 4567"". That is, it prepends +61 (Australian country code) to the US number which already includes the US country code (1).  I suggest that Signal shouldn't presume to prepend any country code. Why is it prepending the Australian country code to numbers? I'm not in Australia..  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Signal on an Australian phone (ie, configure as if you're a normal Australian user). - Move to the US. - Receive a call from an **(edit: unknown)** US number. - ""Reply as txt message"" to the number you received a call from. - Note that Signal prepends the number with +61, which is wrong.  **Actual result:** +61 is prepended to American numbers. **Expected result:** +61 should not be prepended to American numbers. They already begin with '1' (country code). Signal may like to prepend '+' to transform it to ""+1"" for consistency, but that's not necessary.  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.14.10","closed","","TurkeyMan","2018-01-05T19:30:32Z","2018-04-03T04:56:43Z"

And have the same symptom as #7386. But v4.16.9 should have fix it so it's not the very same issue. I didn't remember a message about any kind of database update.  ### Workaround Downloaded and installed Signal 4.15.5 from the website: https://signal.org/android/apk/ Download link here if someone else need this same version and the site is updated: https://updates.signal.org/android/Signal-website-release-4.15.5.apk  I'm immensely grateful to @moxie0 for making such a robust app in this precise downgrading scenario. (well I might be just lucky) I was terrified that the new version might have actually done a change in the DB which would have prevented the old version to work. So the downgrade worked.  Now I learned that I should do a full backup of some critical apps like Signal before upgrading. I'm not sure if oandbackup is actually enough to restore an APK **and** the data due to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7457#issuecomment-370167427 So according to that, uninstalling the will prevent the backup to work. So plain text backup should still work right?  #### The workaround isn't actually enough What would be a way to upgrade to the latest version? (I retried the process and it didn't work) What additional info can I provide?  ### Additional info This is a more than 3 years old install. I'm pretty sure I used oandbackup (which should raise the same issues as Titanium Backup) at some point to troubleshot, test or work around an issue. (including a uninstallation of the app and a restore) I think it happened something like 2 years ago so I don't know if this has consequences.  ### Device info **Device:** Wiko Cink Peax 2 **Android version:** 4.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.16.9  ### Link to debug log When opening the 4.16.9 and seeing no messages. https://framabin.org/?5aa58fc8356f14e6#YWa9TfMmxzgPK8WaOyIj94N53AX1frs935ntMS6WDvA=","closed","","tuxayo","2018-03-06T16:59:28Z","2018-04-20T17:30:13Z"

Unsurprisingly, I got asked for the PIN during the registration process (if I remember this correctly, containing the string *RegistrationActivity_this_phone_number_has_registration_lock_enabled_please_enter_the_registration_lock_pin* ). After entering the correct PIN, the registration process completed. But then I got a second, slightly different looking view that again asked for the registration lock PIN (if I remember this correctly, containing the string *RegistrationLockDialog_registration_lock_helps_protect_your_phone_number_from_unauthorized_registration_attempts* ). I again entered the PIN and got to the conversation list.  **Second case** Here, I got asked for the registration lock PIN several hours after completing the registration process, i. e. directly after unlocking Signal via fingerprint.

Then, I tested 2 scenarios:  1. Go to settings, Apps, Signal and remove all data 2. Remove Signal en reinstall it (I did this to be sure the Android keystore was wiped too to test this).  After both I selected restore backup on the homescreen but in both scenarios I get an invalid password error:  **Actual result:** I get an invalid password error and get asked again to register or restore a backup **Expected result:** It should restore the backup and show either a enter password screen or a conversation list (I don't know if it saves my app password, hev to check the source more thorough).  ### Screenshots The password I was given: ![password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8427572/36796616-d9560ee6-1c9d-11e8-8440-99e7f5f2ee03.JPG) Input of the password (first screen, pwd is longer than my screenwidth): ![enter_password1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8427572/36796619-dbb5a1ec-1c9d-11e8-91ad-652ffc629e2e.jpg) Second part: ![enter_password2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8427572/36796622-dde0c5dc-1c9d-11e8-95fd-815b0f5cd5e5.jpg) Error: ![incorrect_password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8427572/36796629-dfdff4fc-1c9d-11e8-8263-6fd728c694f5.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** Sony Z3 Compact **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.17.0 (at commit https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/332ccbb4eb480221c93baf259a1d307560390747).  ### Link to debug log I could not enter the app so I made a logcat output.

I am using the official Signal APK from https://signal.org/android/apk/, so **not** Noise or anything like that.  For months now, Signal on Android’s network connection seems to “freeze” sporadically (once or twice per day), leaving it unable to send or receive any messages (even things like read confirmations) for long periods of time. During this time, messages can be sent and received from the Signal desktop client normally and without any delay, but none of these messages show up in the Android client. It does not make a difference whether the Android client is open or any conversations are opened – nothing happens.  It seems that Signal can be made “un-stuck” by resetting the phone’s network connection (e. g. disabling WiFi so that the phone switches to cellular data) or using “force stop” to kill and restart the Signal Android client completely. Upon one of these events, all of the messages from the intervening time period will appear in the Android client all at once.  ### Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, since this seems to happen erratically, concrete steps to reproduce are a bit difficult to determine. - Use the phone normally (not sure if longer periods of inactivity are required). - Have someone else send you a message and/or send messages yourself from the Signal desktop client.  **Actual result:** No new messages (sent or received) are displayed in the Signal Android app, even if it is open. This occurs when the phone and the desktop are on the same WiFi network, so the issue is not due to poor connectivity. **Expected result:** Messages should appear immediately in the Signal Android client.  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus One **Android version:** 7.1.2 (LineageOS 14.1). I have never had Google Play services installed and Android Doze is disabled (“Battery optimization: Not optimized”) for Signal. **Signal version:** 4.15.5 (but I’ve been having this issue for months now, so includes many earlier versions)  ### Link to debug log https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b1f29ef755a08091528fefff299057d9  At 15:25, my phone switched to cellular data (because I went out of WiFi range). At that point, all the messages from the last hour or so appeared all at once.","closed","","Socob","2018-02-16T15:01:06Z","2018-04-03T05:04:21Z"

Received messages seem to be encrypted still but all sent messages are accompanied by the unlocked lock in the lower-right corner of message.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Signal on device A (mobile) - Register device A with a secondary number (such as Google Voice), which is forwarded to device A - Install on desktop machine and link to device A - Send and receive messages from contacts as usual - Re-direct secondary number to device B (mobile) - Install Signal on device B - Register device B with the secondary number, which is now forwarded to device B - Unlink desktop machine from device A - Link desktop machine to device B  **Actual result:** All messages sent to existing contacts (synced through the desktop machine) indicate that the other user is no longer a signal user **Expected result:** A prompt indicating that your safety numbers have changed and need to be re-linked with all contacts or automatic re-linking with all existing contacts  ### Additional notes This seems like it might be related to the following bugs (although different in the steps to reproduce): #4812 and #6734    ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 Plus (potter) **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.14.10  ### Link to debug log Immediately after sending the message and receiving the prompt:   https://gist.github.com/d1e639bb189c2b2f66db55b120f75f03 Immediately after sending the unsecure message from the prompt:   https://gist.github.com/99cd795d1baaf48d2fb2e09c2f1cb0e0","closed","","higgsch","2018-01-26T19:14:29Z","2018-04-03T05:07:54Z"

I am creating a new issue since the user that reported 6311 seems to only experience it using WiFi Calling mode.  Incoming group messages which include non-Signal users will sometimes send duplicate ""empty"" MMS messages in the individual conversations of the senders. The MMS message displays a loading icon but never resolves. Eventually the individual MMS message will disappear from the conversation. I have been able to reproduce this twice on my device, but a friend cannot.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive a message from a non-Signal group message  **Actual result:** Messages in non-Signal groups are received once in the group, and then once in individual conversations as a perpetually loading MMS message which eventually disappears.  **Expected result:** A message from a non-Signal group is received in that group once  ### Screenshots  ![screenshot_20180309-223123](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9994880/37238042-7e7380a8-23eb-11e8-9d93-bf3d35995c7b.png)  ![screenshot_20180309-223118](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9994880/37238044-88bbf932-23eb-11e8-82e1-849d38767288.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 6 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.17.0  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/3909860f8aca3f8d6223df9f3d834875944d9c5387e0ee74ff49ec881a41daff","closed","mms,","junitas","2018-03-10T03:58:12Z","2019-11-09T00:49:53Z"

Under certain screen timeout conditions described below, on waking an Android device the Signal unlock screen will display instead of the Android unlock screen and will sometimes remain displayed after inputting correct unlock pattern. If you then input your pattern into the Signal unlock screen, the Android unlock screen will display. After then unlocking your Android as usual, the Signal app will still require you to input the unlock pattern to unlock Signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - Set the Signal lock pattern timeout to be 1 minute - Set your Android lock pattern and set display timeout to 1 minute - Open Signal to the conversation list. Let sit for 1 minute to allow Android to lock, and then an additional minute for the Signal timeout to occur. - Press power button to attempt to unlock phone via pattern. Observe that Signal unlock screen is displayed. - After entering Signal unlock pattern, and then entering Android unlock pattern, observe that Signal is still locked.  **Actual result:** Signal unlock screen is displayed before the Android unlock screen. Entering pattern does not immediately unlock Signal. **Expected result:** Android lock screen is displayed and Signal unlock screen is only displayed when you enter Signal.  ### Screenshots  None as of now because android studio is a resource hog.   ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 6 **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.17.0  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/774c5c5af6648b2e279f7f884813d348d27a00817c05a7485b9ef42fcbfa20f7","closed","","junitas","2018-03-09T00:15:47Z","2018-04-25T16:10:10Z"

We both have WhatsApp and Signal installed. When using the two apps on the same devices, we often observe that Signal fails to send a message to the other user while WhatsApp is able to send a message under the same network conditions.  The cause for this is unknown to me. However, a guess is that it seems to be related to DNS. Often, while being on the road using mobile internet, my cell phone provider gives me internet connectivity but DNS doesn't respond properly for a while. The phone tells me that it has internet, but the web browser complains about not being able to resolve URL addresses.  When this happens, WhatsApp still works, but Signal does not.  A guess would be that WhatsApp may have a hard coded list of server IP addresses or that it remembers those it had resolved previously when DNS was still working. But these are just guesses and it may be a different cause.  ### Steps to reproduce - try to send a message via Signal - Signal complains that it cannot - copy message text, go to Whatsapp - send same message to same user, works this time  **Actual result:** Works with WhatsApp, Doesn't work with Signal **Expected result:** If WhatsApp manages to send messages, Signal should too  ### Device info **Device:** Blackberry DTEK50 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.14.10  Both devices using the same cheap cellphone provider with spotty mobile internet service.  ### Link to debug log  I don't have a debug log.

Since the old Textsecure days I have been securing Signal with a passphrase, since my screen lock is rather short, since I want to be able to open my phone without typing a long passphrase. For Signal this has never been an issue, as I get messages only in short bursts during which Signal could stay unlocked while during longer pauses the app would be locked.  Today I had to reinstall Signal (because of the most recent linageos medling with the keystore) and found myself unable to set a passphrase for locking Signal. The only remaining option was to use my rather weak screen lock or use a fingerprint sensor, which I don't have.  It would be very kind if support for a separate passphrase could be retained.  ### Steps to reproduce - Delete Signal application data that was previously secured with a passphrase - Reregister to Signal - Try to find passphrase option under Settings -> Privacy  **Actual result:** Fail to find passphrase option, find ""Screen lock - Lock Signal access with Android screen lock or fingerprint"" instead. **Expected result:** Be able to set a separate passphrase for Signal.  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus One **Android version:** 7.1.2 (current lineage-14.1-20180321-nightly-bacon) **Signal version:** 4.17.5","closed","","behrmann","2018-03-22T10:53:19Z","2018-03-24T07:27:34Z"

I updated to the latest LineageOS weekly release about six hours ago (v. 20180309 to v. 20180316). https://download.lineageos.org/klte Update finished without any problems. But since the update my Signal is crashing on startup.  I signed up for the beta and my Signal Version is 4.17.3. Due to the crash I am unable to provide a debug log. I did however captured an adb log from the OS. The crash only happens to Signal. Other apps seem to be fine.  This might be related to #7412  ### Steps to reproduce I have a second phone (Galaxy S4 jfltexx) where exactly the same happened. Update to latest LineageOS release. Signal crashed on startup.     ### Screenshots  n/a   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S5 klte **Android version:** 7.1.2 (lineage-14.1-20180316) **Signal version:** 4.17.3  ### Link to debug log   [logcatcrash.txt](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/1821445/logcatcrash.txt)","closed","","halb9","2018-03-17T09:06:11Z","2018-04-09T20:06:34Z"

When I enable backups, they are stored within *internal* memory.

The current Signal documentation does not describe how to parse the new encrypted backup format into a plaintext format similar to what was possible before, or whether this is even possible.  Before version 4.17.5, I was regularly using the plaintext XML backups for (a) a text mining project, and (b) to have an offline copy of the text content of some of my chats, which I'd like to archive and be able to search through (outside of Signal).  I recognize (following #7565 and #7473, as well as the [updated](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/212535828-How-do-I-import-or-export-messages-on-Signal-Android-) [documentation](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360001890291)) that Signal now uses an encrypted format; I can see how this is useful for data security on the phone itself. But the plaintext format was really useful to me, and I am hoping that it is possible to decrypt an encrypted backup outside of Signal (for example, to be able to search through my messages in a text editor, or to parse my messages into a spreadsheet format).  **Is decryption outside of Signal possible? If not, is plaintext backup (as an alternative to encrypted backup) still possible?** I would be happy to help write up documentation about this, but I'm unsure from the current documentation how this works.  ### Steps to reproduce - Create an encrypted backup using `Settings -> Chats and media -> Chat backups` - Transfer the encrypted backup from (for example) `/sdcard/Signal/Backups/` to a desktop computer. - Run `head /path/to/that/file.backup`  **Actual result:** The file shows as encrypted (as is expected), but there is no documentation on how to do anything with the file outside of Signal itself. **Expected result:** Documentation would describe a terminal command that can be used to decrypt the file, or Signal would retain an ""Export Plaintext Backup"" button that users could use in addition to the new encrypted ""Chat backups"" option.  ### Device info  **Device:** Galaxy S8 (Samsung SM G950U) **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.17.5  Thank you for your work on this project!","closed","","jglev","2018-03-30T15:01:34Z","2018-04-12T23:58:18Z"

Three of the entries are individuals, which is redundant since all individual contacts are accessible immediately below. Another idea is, if a combined, abbreviated 'Recent Chats' section is desired, add another comprehensive 'Group Chats' section as well. The fact that any group chat is inaccessible from this interface is a real problem.  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 7.1.2 LineageOS 14.1-20171009 **Signal version:** 4.15.5  ### Link to debug log (Feature restoration request)  The ability to share items with many groups was an important piece of functionality for me. On any given day I am juggling multiple group discussions on Signal. Often I have to share something with multiple groups in one instance, including groups I may not have been active in for a while.  This often means attempting to share to Signal, discovering the intended group is not in the top 5, then having to go back to the originating app, copy the link or media to clipboard, then back to Signal and manually paste. Having to repeat this for many groups in one sitting is a frequent reality for me now and it's cumbersome and slow.  It is especially unwieldy when sharing media (image, audio, video) because often it precludes the ability to cut and paste, so I have to switch out of the originating app, go into Signal, find the intended group, type a period so that the group registers in the top 5, then return the originating app, share, choose Signal, choose the group.  I urge you to avoid revisions that remove functionality. I had been running a deprecated version of Signal to maintain this functionality, but it expired, forcing me to upgrade. If there had been some concerns about the number of group chats listed in the share interface, may I suggest that you add a setting to specify the number of group chats that get displayed, set the default to 5, but allow the user to adjust it.  Thanks again for all your work in bringing Signal to society.","closed","","fongaboo","2018-02-16T22:29:28Z","2018-02-17T05:00:04Z"

While talking with him over unsecure messages about the issue the app briefly recognized him and I started receiving secure messages but that didn't last long.  **Expected result:** The app should properly recognize people using the app and display a warning if problems occur during a conversation.  ### Device info  **Device:** Galaxy S6 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.16.9","closed","","ghost","2018-03-24T18:42:34Z","2018-04-03T10:00:04Z"

Most still display correctly as their name and picture.   I have checked their Google Contact entry and Android contact entry, their phone numbers are in correct +countrycode format.  They used to work.  I've followed the steps about removing contacts without names, and doing ""Refresh"" in Signal.  However, they do show up with their names in the Signal Desktop Chrome app.  Other bugs about ""contacts dont display"" seem to be about ALL contacts not displaying.  This is only some.   ### Steps to reproduce - look at existing conversation with known contact - see number, not name - search for that number in Google contacts on web, find the entry - search for that number in Google contacts on Android, find the entry - go into the Signal conversation, tap on the bar on the top with the contacts phone number - see it expand to unset user icon, shared media, and chat settings - tap around, does not go to Android contacts app  **Actual result:  I should see the contacts name and picture from the contacts database.  **Expected result:** No name, no picture  ### Screenshots  ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 6 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.16.9  ### Link to debug log","closed","","fallenpegasus","2018-03-02T08:04:59Z","2020-07-28T20:42:42Z"

One tick means the message has not yet been received. Two ticks means it has been received. Two blue ticks means the message was also displayed on screen (and likely read).  For obvious reasons, Signal Private Messenger does not have the blue ticks. However, I think it should have, and it wont have to violate privacy.  I message my father on signal sometimes. But he falls asleep on the couch rather often. So when I text him that I will be at the station and need a lift at 00:24 in the night, the fact that he received the message doesn't really help me. I need to ask him to confirm he read it.  **The proposed feature:** So there is a missing feature. Lets add it. However, to preserve the privacy aware nature of Signal Private Messenger, it will have to work as follows: - A user has to manually and deliberatly turn on the confirmations. (via a slider in the settings of the conversation ""send have read confirmations"") - By default, confirmations are off. - It is not nessessary for both sides to turn on the confirmations, but only the side which did turn them on, will send them. - The sender will also see a visual cue on his own messages, reminding him he is sending out confirmations. - The other side can receive the confirmations regardless of his own setting. There is no peer pressure. - For each conversation (with a group or a person) the setting has to be toggled individually. - There is deliberatly no global setting, as we don't want new conversations to have this setting on by default.","closed","","Meteor0id","2018-02-23T04:08:18Z","2018-02-24T11:23:30Z"

Either one for each SIM for dual Sim phones, **or** any number of user defined profiles to which a conversation can assigned.   This is a suggestion for a feature which other messenging apps seem to not have put any effort in yet. Therefore, implementing this might also give signal an edge and some publicity. But besides that its just something some of us expected would be standard in 2018. Need to have.  I for one have a dual sim phone. In my case one sim for private use, anothe for business. **The business sim I may take out of my phone once or twice a year to hand over to a buisness partner.**  **The issue:** In messaging apps including signal, all conversations are part of one account. They are all mixed together. On top of that (issue 2) my buisness partners can see the same profile as my family. This is rather restricting. My mother can see what my girlfriend can see and what my clients can also see. Just take a minute to imagine that. Yea that sucks right?  **Suggestion:** Multiple (user) profiles in signal. Its a rather drastic step, I know. But think about it. Its human nature to uphold different identities. And this is also what privacy is about. **I for one would love to keep those identities seperate.** **The solution could be to have one identify for each sim card, or the solution could be to allow users to make infinite profiles and group contacts in them.**  I know this would be a massive undertaking, all I ask is that we think about this. Could this be something we want?  Addition: **Both solutions are also relevant to single SIM phones!** - In case of coupling a profile to a certain SIM instead of a certain phone, a user can switch his SIM for another one and also assume a different identity to use with it. - in case of user defined profiles coupled to certain conversations, it obviously doesnt matter how many SIMs are in the phone, it will also be of use to single SIM phones.","closed","","Meteor0id","2018-01-27T05:39:24Z","2018-04-03T05:07:43Z"

I also haven't checked all closed issues.  - [ ] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I skipped through https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Signal is running on a Nexus 5x with Lineage OS version 15.1-20181008-NIGHTLY-bullhead. OpenGApps Nano is installed but not logged in to any Google account. Upon trying to register Signal I get this error: ""Unable to connect to service. Please check network connection and try again.""  Most likely related to this message:  `10-15 14:21:35.714 17061 21539 W RegistrationActivity: java.io.IOException: AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`  I think I can remember I got Signal working without OpenGApps installed, but i'm not sure. Is there a fallback solution?  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Lineage OS and flash OpenGApps nano and don't login to any google account, probably. - Try to register Signal  **Actual result:** ""Unable to connect to service. Please check network connection and try again."" **Expected result:** Being able to register Signal.   ### Screenshots Nope   ### Device info **Device:** Google Nexus 5x **Android version:** Lineage OS 15.1-20181008-NIGHTLY-bullhead, Android 8.10 **Signal version:** version 4.26.2  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/b7d85c57fd5a654f02cca9f1781dcc9c7d80845a1a8ee9606994d985f1a3cb2e","closed","","0x747972","2018-10-15T12:48:41Z","2019-03-15T21:49:43Z"

Is there an easy way to remove the passphrase from the code? I can not access the app.  Thank you.","closed","","EnesSoyaker","2018-03-13T09:11:37Z","2018-03-13T20:26:08Z"

"","7514","Sending SMS to multiple recipients","Hi, obviously it is (still) not not possible to send SMS to multiple recipients at once.  Of course there have been several issues about this, which are referenced in this context:  - #232 Closed. Obviously this is about MMS, which is in real life not an alternative to ""old school"" SMS, so it has not much to do with plain SMS - #347 Closed due to cross-reference (not due to a solution) - #365 Closed because @moxie0 pointed to complications with the Android subsystem - #413 Open but locked. Here is where it gets interesting: @mcginty told that they won't invest time into a ""legacy protocol"". The fact, that it has been requested be many users could indicate, that it is not as ""legacy"" as one might think. In fact, what's making an application successful is, that it fulfills the users needs/requests. So IMHO something can not be ""legacy"", if it is used be much more than just a hand full of people. Additionally @mcginty says that this feature is not on the short-term road map - which has been three years ago (-> long-term)! - #1395 Closed due to cross-reference to #270 or #1499 - #1499 Closed for no real reason  No offense at all, I know that many developers are working in their free time! I just ask, because I don't understand the philosophy. - People ask for a feature (which is crucial for some of them), and get told, that it is old and legacy - one issue after another about this topic pops up and get closed again - people get told, that they are free to develop this feature, which is kind of ""arrogant"", because not everyone is able to do that. A question to developers may not be rejected with the message ""Develop it yourself"".  From my point of view, this feature is important, too, because I like to use Signal as my only messaging app, but I can't because of this. How should I argument, if friends tell me ""I don't use Signal, because it does not support this and that.""?! And from my point of view, this would be a much more useful feature, than 50 new emojis...  Greetings","closed","","Jojo-A","2018-03-13T09:49:29Z","2018-03-13T16:38:38Z"

"","7483","[4.17.0] Frontend loses contact with backup job","Hi,  I'm trying the new 4.17.0 backup process, but I have a fair amount of messages (35k+, >3GB), so the backup takes a long time. It appears that when my device goes to screen lock and I go back, the frontend doesn't understand that a backup is in progress anymore.  ### Steps to reproduce - Enable chat backups - Wait until the device hits the Android lock screen - Unlock the screen to go back to the app; Create backup now says “no recent backup”  It appears it's still taking the backup, because there's still a system notification icon, and if you press “Create backup” again, it may or may not find the backup job again and say “20200 messages so far…” or something similar. But I've also seen it restart.  ### Device info **Device:** Nexus 5 (I'm trying to migrate, thus the bug! :-) ) **Android version:** 6.0.2 **Signal version:** 4.17.0  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/e2ef1a51bcfe31954e7d49707ce77a9d0a4de32a6ac329092881ad3e356854f4","closed","","sesse","2018-03-09T12:51:43Z","2018-03-09T19:03:52Z"

It helps us a lot with better and safer communication amongst activists in our country, Indonesia. But we do find some issues and want to share it with the devs for better protecting the privacy of the users.  **Expected behavior:** 1. We can choose to use phone number or screen name for registration 2. Invite/ Approve contacts 3. To be able to remove someone from a group chat (ex: if one of the members lost their mobile)  **Current Behavior:** 1. Still using mobile number for registration.  2. Address book synchronization; so everyone that have your phone number even if they’re not in your address book can chat and call you. 3. Can’t kick someone from group chat   About us: We are 2 digital security trainers from Indonesia doing a UX workshop with 10 digital security tools users to look at some tools and collect feedback on user experience.","closed","","coffeewithfriend","2018-07-16T09:14:05Z","2018-07-16T15:02:34Z"

Before this change, the `onSwipe` event would be interpreted as a conversation archiving. The `ConversationListItemInboxZero` object would be cast to a `ConversationListItem`, causing a `ClassCastException` which would cause Signal to crash. In this change, each handler for a swipe (the archival action and the animation) will check if the view is of type `ConversationListItemInboxZero`, and if so will simply return.  This was tested on a virtual Nexus 6 on Android 6.0 and 7.0 by archiving conversations until an inbox is empty and attempting to swipe away the zero'd graphic. The view and archival actions then go back to normal behavior when conversations populate the inbox once more.","closed","","junitas","2018-02-21T03:09:47Z","2018-03-06T17:35:54Z"

If the failed message is a push group message and the NetworkFailure object is null, the eventual call to `getAddress()` during message send retry will throw a `NullPointerException`. This method call on a null NetworkFailure object is what caused the crash referenced in #7413. Instead of trying to get an address off of a null NetworkFailure, this change will set the address to null which will result in a failed send instead of an application crash.  This change was tested by forcing a null NetworkFailure to be created (hard-coded) during a retry of a group message. I first was able to re-create the crash, and then verify that the new changes averted the crash. I then tested that this change preserved normal functionality for an expected NetworkFailure by directing Signal to a bad server URL, forcing the retry button, and then retrying under normal network conditions for both individual and group messages.","closed","wontfix,","junitas","2018-03-07T04:13:12Z","2022-02-02T06:09:12Z"
"","7516","Reduce image stutter by using subsampling more often.","Fixes #7208.  On some phones, zooming in on large images (say, a 4k image) would be slow and stutter a lot. This is due to ZoomingImageView using a regular PhotoView instead of a SubsamplingScaleImageView. ZoomingImageView decides whether or not to use a SubsamplingScaleImageView depending on whether the image has a dimension larger than BitmapUtil.getMaxTextureSize().   However, while that method will determine the maximum size of an image that is _possible_ to render, it doesn't necessarily mean it can be rendered _efficiently_. There is some size at which some phones will have to continually re-upload a bitmap to the GPU, as seen in this systrace taken from a Moto E.  ![moto-e-zoom-stutter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37311915/37359063-e1775fa6-26a9-11e8-9fcc-11ecdf11ae12.png)  We could just use SubsamplingScaleImageView all the time (it has built-in logic to prevent tiling on smaller images), but given that it doesn't use Glide to load Bitmaps, we shouldn't be over-using it. As a result, I altered BitmapUtil.getMaxTextureSize() to have a cap of 2048, which from research and experimentation seems to be a good number (OpenGL operates in powers of 2 -- if 4096 is too big, 2048 is the next best bet).  Tested on the following devices. No scroll jank on images >= 2048x2048.

Previously received MMS messages with vCards attached (displayed as long vCard content) are also supported - they are handled separately in code. Received contacts can be imported via Contacts app by clicking on them. Tested with several Signal messages and MMS, sent from/to Signal and Messages app, including contacts with avatar.  Implementation is somewhat simple, inefficient and incorrect from architectural point of view, partially due to support of previously received MMS messages (handled as text) and logically based on vCard support in QKSMS client ([two lines in fact](https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/blob/master/QKSMS/src/main/java/com/moez/QKSMS/ui/messagelist/MessageListAdapter.java#L543)).  Such support in standard Messaging app is much more difficult and efficient, partly described [here](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Messaging/+/master/src/com/android/messaging/datamodel/media/VCardRequest.java#50).  This implementation was done for internal goals and does not pretend to be merged as is or even analyzed for obvious reasons. May be it can be used as starting point for someone from future Signal Foundation, who will implement such support. Also, it can be changed, optimized in some way, if some recommendations would be given.","closed","","ghost","2018-03-18T19:24:57Z","2019-03-13T10:46:35Z"

"","7745","Signal mostly blocked in Russia","Due to Roskomnadzor action against Amazon and Google networks used by Telegram to circumvent its ban in Russia (method previously used by Signal in other countries), most of Signal's functionality is blocked, at least for large ISPs.  Currently, only **basic text messaging is possible** - without voice messaging, video or photo sharing(photo and video sharing may still work for some ISPs) .  Signal calls also don't work anymore for many (perhaps for most) Russian  ISPs.   Please consider handling this issue, e.g. by directing Russian Signal traffic through the servers that are  not affected (maybe the ones who successfully handle text messaging at the time of writing?). Hopefully, the freedom of speech will survive in Russia - along with its acolyte, Signal messenger.","closed","","leedoyle","2018-04-28T13:25:38Z","2018-08-09T07:49:13Z"

Another problem is that my wired headset on my Sony L25i is still muted only with Signal, maybe due to echo cancelation...","closed","","watchmoretv","2018-08-07T17:02:01Z","2018-08-08T14:59:13Z"

"","7577","Show groups when searching for contacts.","Currently, if you're searching for a contact to start a conversation with or send a share to (via the Android sharing system), groups do not appear. With this change, groups will now appear when searching, located under their own  heading.  I also took the opportunity to clean up ContactsCursorLoader to increase readability, especially now that groups are thrown into the mix, which ups the complexity of the data that is returned.  [Demo Videos](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/files/1857177/groups-in-search.zip)  Fixes #7202.  **Test Cases** * Groups show up in search when choosing a share recipient * Groups show up in search when choosing a new conversation recipient * Groups do not show up when adding a member to a group during group creation * Groups do not show up when adding a member to an existing group * SMS contacts do not show up when adding a member to an existing group, as before * Whether or not SMS enabled is respected on all of the above use cases * When groups show up, headings will appear based on the following logic:   * If there are both groups and contacts, contacts will appear first under a ""Contacts"" heading, and groups will appear below all contacts under a ""Groups"" heading.   * If there are no groups, there will be no headings -- only contacts.   * If there are groups but no normal contacts, there will be no headings -- only groups.  **Test Devices** * [Moto X (2nd Generation), Android 7.1](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_x_(2nd_gen)-6649.php)","closed","","greyson-signal","2018-03-28T18:26:48Z","2018-04-24T14:55:53Z"

Steps to reproduce - I did a backup of Signal 4.19.3 through Titanium and Mybackup. - When I tried to made a backup through Signal the backup always stops when the messages reaches 36000 or so, I have the passphrase btw, but not the backup. - I did a clean installation for my device Galaxy Note 4 N910C, stock ROM 6.0.1. - After that I am unable to to restore my messages. - Signal just keeps crashing on startup after restoring the ""data only"" or data+app"". I tried to use Signal cleanup 4.15 then restoring the database only but nothing changed, the opening never changed: ""Hello World"" and there is no option to do.  Actual result: crashed on startup Expected result: should starts normally  Device info Device: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910C Android version: 6.0.1 Signal version: 4.19.3  Link to the debug log: https://debuglogs.org/1eb2e8825d047d7f1c2b0fc5d3ea60c89fad98e12b2a1450a9c9612ceb6bd236","closed","","DBGT-87","2018-05-08T14:17:01Z","2018-05-08T20:48:33Z"

"","7400","Signal crashes after TB restore on another device","Because https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7386 is closed and this is a separate issue I'm opening a new issue.  I have: - [x] searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description After a succesfull upgrade to 4.16.4 up to commit https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/0bbe83f8f256219985c61ab2d41ad5a1df5001f3 , I tried to restore a Titanium Backup on a test device. However, Signal on that device crashes as soon as it starts.  ### Steps to reproduce - Upgrade Signal to 4.16.4 - Make a backup with Titanium Backup - Restore that backup on another  phone  **Actual result:** When Signal is started on the other phone it crashes at startup even before the password can be entered. **Expected result:** Signal should show all messages that it shows on the first device.  Perhaps I miss something about SQLCipher, do I need to change some global key on the device or something like that?  ### Device info Both devices are of the same type: **Device:** Sony Xperia Z3 compact **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.16.4  ### Link to debug log Debug log is not possible to create from Signal but this is the relevant logcat output: ``` 02-06 13:13:24.216

I tried to install the Signal app on a Chromebook and got the ""device not supported"" message. Chrome OS exposes a Android 6.0 compatible emulation layer, however to install the APK manually I not only need to disable unverified sources, I also need to put the whole Chromebook in developer mode. Developer mode disables OS verification - roughly it has the same equivalent as rooting an Android phone. This is ostensibly not what is desired when a user wants to install a secure messenger.

You need to stop making more work for yourself with this over zealous moderation. All you're doing is creating noise with all these attempts to silo people into forums and the like.  > As I mentioned in #8308, you can tap someone's avatar in the conversation list in order to be taken to their system contact page to make a phone call. So two taps, not too bad.  This is not how the software functions.  The only call option on this screen is an encrypted call button.  There is no way I can see to make a standard phone call to a contact which has at some point in the past had Signal installed without navigating to them via the phone app itself.  It would be handy if instead of insta-locking this issue you took the time to understand it.

After going through all my contacts one by one and deleting all media I managed to clear out 100MB, which left the app's data with 450MB (not including the 66.5MB of the app itself). I have used Signal for quite a while but this seems to me way excessive for just storing textual data. In comparison, my desktop app takes 223MB (or 337MB; for some reason I have a second desktop signal folder), including everything (software + data). My history with the desktop app is somewhat shorter, but this storage includes that of the media which I haven't deleted, i.e, those pictures that on the mobile app took up 100MB of storage. It seems to me that either the Android app uses a different and much less storage-efficient encryption than the desktop client, or otherwise mishandles storage allocation. Given that the app doesn't let one move the installation to an external storage (why not I don't understand, but that's another issue), and that my internal storage is rather sparse, that's a pretty big problem.   Thank you.  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung J5 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.24.8 (just upgraded from 4.20.X, if that matters)","closed","","ghost","2018-08-31T15:53:54Z","2018-09-01T09:45:41Z"

My reason to do that was that I had 2 telephone numbers for a contact and while Telephone app chose one, Signal chose the other one. So I decided to delete contact and add just one phone number.  Explicit sync (via *Settings - Users and accounts - Account sync - three dots menu in right upper corner - Sync now*) won't add the contact.   The contact won't be added even if you wait 3 days.  Adding the contact's phone number under a different name won't help either.  Killing Signal and starting it again, explicit sync inbetween, does not fix it either  ### Steps to reproduce - Have or add contant that was recognized by Signal. It might be necessary to have two or more phone numbers for contact like in my case. - Delete the contact from Contacts application. - Add the contact with one of the phone numbers that were used before. - Note that if you have an existing conversation with the contact, the existing display name will be updated in conversation list under the new name you used when adding the contact again in Contacts app. - However, when you tap the compose button (the pen icon lower right), you can't find the contact (neither searching nor scrolling through list). - Explicit sync via *Settings - Users and contacts* like mentioned above doesn't help  **Actual result:** Contact can't be found either by search or scrolling through the contact list.  **Expected result:** Contact should reappear either after some time (scheduled sync) or explicit sync (via *Users and accounts - ... - Sync now*)  **Workaround:** let the contact send you message and keep it in among your existing conversations.  ### Device info **Device:** Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.17.5  ### Link to debug log  Apparently the application tries to sync, but only updates the display name, which is updated in the conversation list, but the contact is not added when searching for it or scrolling throught contacts.

No visible error-message is displayed, but there is a java.lang.SecurityException buried in the debug-logs.    ### Steps to reproduce - androidPhone - install signal - deny access to android Contacts addressbook  - send some messages by hand-entering recipient phone numbers within signalapp  - home - signal - conversations list - tap search button (magnifying glass) to full-text-search those encrypted conversations   **Actual result:**  - nothing happens visually after tapping the search-btn-magnifying-glass  - debug logs show java.lang.SecurityException (see below)   **Expected result:**  - no exception should be thrown  - signalapp should display a message demanding that I give it permission to access the android Contacts addressbook, so it can search my signal-only conversations  (sigh ;-)    **Desired (feature-request) result:**  - or alternatively, instead of refusing to search my signal-conversations until I give signalapp permission to access android Contacts addressbook, ideally it would be nice for signalapp to just **warn** me that it was only searching what it had permission to search, and then go ahead and perform the search, and return the search-results.

The posts there contain valuable information that cannot concisely be copied here. To deal with this issue, a whitelist was in place initially, which worked in the sense that only known ‘good’ devices would use built-in echo cancellation. Afterwards a switch was made to a blacklist, which was however not updated, leaving many people with non-usable call functionality.  *I suggest others experiencing this issue to wait with commenting until the developers have indicated what info they need. The material in issue #6241 should give them a good starting point.*  ### Bug description Echo cancellation does not work on multiple devices and for various Android versions. For example, my Samsung GT-I9192 Galaxy S4 Mini Duos (serranodsxx) on Android 7.1.2 (LineageOS) is affected.  ### Steps to reproduce - call someone with Signal, using with affected device/OS (other party's device/OS seems irrelevant) - have conversation  **Actual result:** Other party hears disturbing echo **Expected result:** Other party does not hear disturbing echo  Depending on the device, the results vary when using headphones or not. On my device, the echo becomes *worse* when using headphones, so in a situation where the echo cannot be caused by sound being captured by my microphone. (My guess is that the echo cancellation functionality actually *adds* the echo.) For others, the echo disappears in this situation.  Suggested potential workarounds until the root cause can be addressed are to update the blacklist, to include an ‘advanced’ option that switches hardware echo cancellation on or off, or to disable echo cancellation when using headphones. A workaround is needed to avoid chasing users to Skype or so. (I managed to convince my family to switch to Signal and then the whitelist-to-blacklist move forced us back to Skype.)  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung GT-I9192 Galaxy S4 Mini Duos (serranodsxx) **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.17.5  ### Link to debug log  Not applicable.","closed","","equaeghe","2018-04-04T19:59:58Z","2022-07-30T14:52:20Z"

I just found some more minor UI bugs in dark theme. I am only sure of the first one that it is really related to the recent update. I am not sure about the others.  ### Bug description 1 Action Bar in dark theme in Conversation overview activity on the one hand and all settings pages on the other hand differ. The same is valid for the activities Share Contact (Parameter Selection Overview) and Share Contact (Edit Name), Share GIF, and Select new Contact. Those activities are colored as the settings activity. In the light theme, this difference does not occur (as intended). ![screenshot_20181004-212903](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46500128-5082e900-c822-11e8-8fec-7715b29d3112.png)   ### Steps to reproduce 1 - Open Signal & see action bar - From there, open settings and see action bar  **Actual result:** Action bar colors differ. **Expected result:** Action bar color is the same.  ###Bug description 2 Background color of ""Verify Safety Number"" differs from other backgrounds in light and dark theme ![screenshot_20181004-212918](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46498808-c5542400-c81e-11e8-92d7-57cb251159a1.png)  ### Steps to reproduce 2 - Open Signal and View Background - Any Conversation ->Conversation Settings -> Verify Safety Number and View Background  **Actual result:** Background color differs in both light and dark theme. **Expected result:** I think in dark theme they should be the same. In light theme I see reasons for how it is now, since a lighter background might make the QR background from the activity background indistinguishable.  ### Bug description 3 Conversation settings activity allows scrolling up after entering this activity (when there are no shared media). The message divider, which is usually between ""shared media"" and ""about"" appears then. ![screenshot_20181004-213009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46499304-000a8c00-c820-11e8-9468-3df05a7265af.png) The screenshot shows when the activity opens and after scrolling up.  ### Steps to reproduce - Go to a conversation without shared media. - Go to conversation settings - Scroll up  **Actual result:** Scroll up possible, message divider shown **Expected result:** The message divider should be hidden, when shared media are hidden. ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.28.0  ### Link to debug log The bugs are easily and reliably reproducible.

Apologies that this is not strictly an ""issue"" - but it is also neither a feature request or suggestion that would fit in the community forums, nor a support request for the app for which I would go to https://support.signal.org. I do think this will be interesting for other developers too:  I'm blocked by #7831, I need to backup my chats, but can't wait for the next official Signal release (which will be who-knows when).  So I successfully built the latest master branch from source and signed the created `*-website-*` and ``*-play-*`` apk's. When installing that apk on the phone, it asks ""Do you want to install an update to this existing application? Your existing data will not be lost."". However it doesn't finish installing, there's an error after a couple of seconds, ""The package conflicts with an existing package by the same name."". This happens with both the play and website apks (both signed), as well as the debug apks. I've also tried renaming `` in `strings.xml` but that didn't help either.  I suppose this might happen because I originally installed Signal from the Playstore? Is there any way to go from the currently installed Playstore version to a version built from the latest master branch, so that I can backup my chats? I'm afraid to uninstall the Signal version installed from the Playstore, because I am afraid that it will remove all the chats with it.","closed","","patrikhuber","2018-05-29T15:42:20Z","2018-05-29T19:57:42Z"

However, one of the issues did not get resolved fully. ### Bug description The avatar color in the action bar is **sometimes** still wrong directly after swiping Signal out of the recent apps. It does not happen always, but it might be related to any deeper app-close from Android. Wrong means to me not equal to the conversation color set by myself.  After opening any other activity from the Signal home screen and going back, this bug does not appear (until closing Signal again by swiping it out of recent apps).  I did try to clear the cache. Then, the bug did not appear for a short time only. See my legacy bug report #8252 and the fix #eb11d5c  ### Steps to reproduce - Swipe Signal out of recent apps (close) - Open Signal and view avatar (green instead of purple in my case) - Go to any other activity (e.g. open a conversation) - Go back and view avatar (purple as intended in my case)  **Actual result:** Step 2: Green instead of purple **Expected result:** Step 2: Purple as set in conversation color.  ### Screenshots left to right: Open and go to activity and go back. ![screenshot_20181010-195202](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46756648-3afd3b80-ccc8-11e8-8bf6-1cca64767d7c.png)  If I'd take a guess, the line 180 Recipient     recipient     = Recipient.from(this, localAddress, true); might give an ""empty"" recipient because the database loading is slow. In that case, there might not be any good way to prevent this.  ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.28.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/da014b0bbd11f8f0389ab0b2615d3667f6329dcdad474156bc680a4612176751 I started the app at 20:21 when the bug occured.

STEPS : This bug never occurs on first few occasions after device start. After several closures of Signal, Phone app will then consistently open and minimise for rest of day.  ACTUAL : Phone app opening and minimising upon closure of Signal.  EXPECTED : Signal should close without other apps opening.

I hope this is useful. If not, feel free to close this. In that case: sorry for the noise.  ### Bug description 1 The conversation with myself is colored differently than my profile avatar in the status bar. ![screenshot_20181004-191020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46491509-3984cc80-c80b-11e8-8afb-8601fe45afd9.png)  ### Steps to reproduce 1 - have a conversation with yourself - [I don't know if this is required. I did not do so, but I might have done in the past: Change the color of the conversation with yourself] - See your system avatar next the ""Signal"" text in the action bar and the conversation color. Those colors differ. **Actual result:** Conversation with myself (purple) and my avatar in action bar (green) have different colors **Expected result:** Conversation with myself (purple) and my avatar in action bar (green) have the same color  ### Possible reason against fix 1 - It might be that the system avatar color matches the color that users see, who install Signal freshly, when they view my contact.  Then it might be that this my action bar icon and their contact of me match in colors.  ### Bug description 2 The footer of shared contacts is barely distinguishable from background under bad light conditions. ![screenshot_20181004-191041](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46491852-2faf9900-c80c-11e8-877e-138042059eca.png)  ### Steps to reproduce 2 - Share a contact OR receive a contact - Have dark theme enabled - View the shared/received contact in bad light conditions  **Actual result:** Contact footer and background really hard to distinguish **Expected result:** Contact footer and background should be distinguishable  ### Bug description 3 SMS/Text contacts not stored in address book have small icon in contact settings page. ![screenshot_20181004-191152](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13498303/46492234-3a1e6280-c80d-11e8-914f-d81806c0e811.png)  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive Text from anyone not in your address book - tab the action bar in the conversation with them - see small ""person"" icon  **Actual result:** Icon is small **Expected result:** Icon should be big  ### Screenshots See above.  ### Device info **Device:** Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.28.0  ### Link to debug log I submit a debug log because this issues are easily and reliable reproducible.","closed","","ForestGu","2018-10-04T17:49:19Z","2018-10-04T18:36:52Z"

As of now I had conversations with 5 contacts. 1 SMS, 3 Individual Signal contacts and 1 Signal Group Chat. These 3 Signal contacts do have individual avatars. Two avatars have been set by the contacts (using Signals feature of setting avatar pictures) one avatar picture was set by me in the android phone book. The group chat also has an avatar set.   When I stop Signal and start it three out of five avatars are shown instantly. One generic for the SMS contact, one Signal contact where I set the avatar picture myself and one Signal contact that set the picture by itself.  Two avatars do show up around 15 seconds later: The group chat avatar and a Signal contact avatar that was set by the contact.  If I open a conversation of one of those two contacts that are missing an avatar and press the missing avatar picture it's empty and I have to wait another 15 seconds before it shows up.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Avatars are missing - Wait 15 seconds - Avatars show up  **Actual result:** Some avatars need around 15 seconds to show up. **Expected result:** All avatars should be available instantly  ### Screenshots ![shot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15171154/38304672-7df2f32e-380a-11e8-874e-9ebc53d41769.jpg)

Pretty much the same as described in #6246 by @EvanK - my conversation partner and i are on Lineageos 14.1 as well. Additional info:  -It also happens that my conv. partner has single checkmarks too, but i did receive the messages. This was the case when i made the screenshot. On the other phone, sent messages had one single checkmark, my messages were missing. -It may happen for only one of us, i.e. unidirectional communication, other side is stuck with single checkmarks -Force quitting & restarting, resetting network etc. does not help. Not even a reboot.  After upgrading the app, the error was gone for about 24h and then started again.  I am opening another ticket after reading #7598.  ### Steps to reproduce - My best guess is to use two non-playstore versions and to exchange messages for a couple of days - If that doesn't make the bug occur, it might even have to do with LineageOs. I will try out if this is true by making someone with stock Android install the web version.  **Actual result:** At any point in a conversation, messages will stop to obtain a second checkmark for an indefinite amount of time. **Expected result:** Messages should be delivered as usual.  ### Screenshots ![screenshot_20180704-183800](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26491995/42288447-01c7e73e-7fbb-11e8-908e-81d92caeb2a1.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia Z5 Compact (suzuran) **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.21.6  ### Link to debug log  https://pastebin.com/9wf80arh","closed","help wanted,","nightbluepn","2018-07-04T17:04:37Z","2021-07-09T14:33:24Z"

Some alerts more than once per message received.","- [X] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [X] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [X] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description While using Signal Desktop (SD) in-focus on a specific contact I should not receive sound alerts in Signal for Android (SA) for messages received from that same contact. Sometimes this works correctly, but sometimes when I have a custom alert tone for a contact I will receive one or even two alerts on SA if the app is out-of-focus for that contact. I have even had it where the first, custom alert, is interrupted part way through the sound file and the default alert plays as the interrupting second sound. It is not consistent. I had my wife send me six messages in a row and saw (1) no alert on SA, (2) one custom alert, (3) double custom alerts, and (4) one custom alert interrupted by one default alert.  ### Steps to reproduce - Launch SD and click on contact so that person is active/in-focus. - With SA out-of-focus (phone on, app not active) have contact send message. **OR** - With SA in-focus but showing the list of contact messages, not inside the specific test contact, have contact send message. - Monitor the type of alert displayed by SA.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) - Inconsistent results. Sometimes there is no alert, sometimes one alert, sometimes two alerts, sometimes two different alerts. (See bug description)  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) - With the contact active in SD, regardless of the state of SA, there should not be an alert tone on the phone. This was the way it has worked for the year or so I have been using SD (was a very early implementer).  ### Device info **Device:** samsung SM-G930V (heroqltevzw) **Android version:** 8.0.0 (G930VVRS4CRG2, R16NW.G930VVRS4CRG2) **Signal version:** 4.25.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/b113d79719a50f175cd72cc15e186b8abe55ff3ad8154b1058c4131a2e4b6e95","closed","","SingerGuy","2018-09-03T02:20:21Z","2018-09-05T23:29:24Z"

The recording is sent as if I were holding the ""voice message"" button on that users' conversation, which I obviously was NOT. This is obviously frustrating, as my private conversation got leaked to my other contact. The recording is exactly 5 minute long, probably because it is an hardcoded limit for voice messages, but I'm not sure? I listened to the recording, and I'm not sure which device the recording came from, given that I was using ""handheld mode"" on my phone. I have signal desktop installed on my Chromebook, as well as on my Samsung Galaxy S8 Android phone. Neither devices are rooted, both running regular versions of the operating system.  ### Steps to reproduce - Call someone - Conversation doesn't get sent to 3rd party contact as voice message - The end  **Actual result:**  - Call someone on Android device - Chat with someone on the Chromebook, using TEXT ONLY, while not even having the application in focus (for most of the call, I was actively typing in the Chrome web browser on the Chromebook) - At some point in the call, the conversation somehow started being recorded, and after 5 minutes, got sent to chat contact as a voice message - Call gets recorded for 5 minute, being sent after that period of time, meaning it stopped recording prior to the end of the call - Message gets sent at the 5 minute mark - End call - Nothing specific happens   **Expected result:** My PRIVATE conversation does not get sent as a voice message to a 3rd party contact    ### Device info Android: **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S8 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.26.2  Chromebook: **Device:** ASUS C302a **Signal version:** 0.46.6    ### Link to debug log Android: https://debuglogs.org/fecfb425698ccda4f2988bcedfd4e66885192ec77e6c4ffc186ea4d92388fe96 Chromebook: https://debuglogs.org/acb61f4a8af276a4f0f4248ec6dba1a568bf2eb6756f2f6bff3742d688a0fa85","closed","","ldionmarcil","2018-10-04T01:32:31Z","2019-12-29T05:54:13Z"

The issue is strange, as it appears to be somewhat localized - someone else, whom I've personally referred to Signal, doesn't have this issue at all when receiving the same image from the same sender. Similarly, whenever the other Signal user sends me a message (using the Signal protocol), the image quality is perfectly fine. Images received from various senders (using MMS) all result in the same blurry image quality, making the app unusable for receiving pictures of notes or any text, really.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive MMS message from a non-Signal user - Attempt to view MMS messages  **Actual result:** The image is displayed but blurry, and much lower quality than the original image. **Expected result:** The image would be received and displayed at the original image quality.  ### Screenshots   ## Album ====== https://imgur.com/a/ri5Ny  ## The original picture that I sent ===================================== https://i.imgur.com/dYGtSck.jpg  ## The same picture, downloaded and sent back to me ================================================= (Note: It is perfectly legible and not blurry on his end https://i.imgur.com/q3mFVa1.jpg   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S4 Model SCH-I545PP **Android version:** 5.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.17.5 (although the issue has persisted for more than a year, when using both the Beta and the standard version from the Play Store)  ### Link to debug log  https://pastebin.com/GJubpsD3  ### Similar threads https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6607 https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/672","closed","mms,","Sollybird","2018-04-15T19:29:50Z","2019-11-03T18:47:56Z"

It is definitely not a memory problem, there is more than enough internal free memory available.  ### Steps to reproduce - Select 'Einstellungen' - 'Unterhaltungen und Medieninhalte' - 'Unterhaltungen sichern' (this is 'Settings' - 'Chats and media' - 'Chat backup') - Tap 'Sicherung erstellen' (Start backup)  **Actual result:** Backup is started, message counter increments - and when all messages are done, the status is again 'last backup: never' (and no file is generated, not even the directories /Signal/Backups). **Expected result:** backup file should be present in /Signal/Backups  Note that the backup does NOT start automatically for me - it did that only once. Now, even when I disable backups (thus clearing the non-existing files) and re-enable it, I get a new passphrase but the backup does only start after tapping the button. No problem so far, but I tried that now since two days and always get the same result ('last backup: never' and no file).

When I select the message box again, I can type normally, but the enter key icon switches back to send icon, so I don't get anywhere.  **Expected result:** New buttons appear, I can press one of them to insert a newline.  ### Screenshots Message box selected, enter key is in send mode ![default-mode_selection-present](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1710591/40325914-b5eb6128-5d3d-11e8-9e50-a085348aeeda.png)  Enter key is in newline mode, but the message box gets deselected ![enter-key-appears_no-selection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1710591/40325925-cbcedc40-5d3d-11e8-87aa-79c1aa5fcc3a.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F) **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.19.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/1c760c276c751e43ad18f50d5437afc3cdc3bb2c2be374036970e39eff9203f6","closed","","butla","2018-05-21T19:28:05Z","2018-05-22T15:34:22Z"

This bug is present when using either the front camera or the rear camera. **Expected result:** The viewfinder shows the entire field of view available to the camera and the captured image matches what is shown in the viewfinder.  It's worth noting that the Pixel 3 has two front facing cameras, one of which has a wide angle lens.  ### Screenshots None available  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.29.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/cce520452a627c33512db3672978ff0467442cb4a0b62d2df12fa75f84550814","closed","","justin-","2018-10-21T00:30:38Z","2021-10-04T10:43:18Z"

Directly afterwards, it is shown as normal (small) emoji (second screenshot). Closing the conversation and opening again sometimes fixes it, sometimes it doesn't. If I don't use system emoji, the jumbomojis are shown correctly.  **Expected result:** The emoji-only message should always show a jumbomoji.  Since this bug only occurs for system emojis and I think I had some Google updates recently, maybe this bug is not produced by Signal (but I don't have another app that uses system jumbomojis).

On top of that, it seems the actual SMS message is delayed in sending, rather than Signal just displaying a sending animation. I don't think this is a network error because I have tested other messaging (including SMS) apps and they send instantly.   Additionally, the error seems to happen irrespective of my device location.  ### Steps to reproduce Generally, the extended animation can last up to 3 minutes, and seems to happen intermittently. This seems to happen more frequently when I stay within a single conversation window, sending and receiving multiple SMS messages within the same window over a few minutes (without turning the screen off).  This never happens with Signal messages to other Signal users.  I am on the Bell Canada network, but I do not believe this is the issue.  **Actual result:** Intermittent delay when sending SMS. **Expected result:** Animation should display the check mark near instantly after sending, as opposed to being delayed up to 3 minutes.   ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Z2 Play  **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.23.4","closed","wontfix,","cwillhelm","2018-07-26T02:54:27Z","2022-02-04T17:16:49Z"

Additionally, the content of the message will be lost, rather than being sent as-is, paused, or otherwise retained.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install an app (such as [Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mrigapps.andriod.breakfree.deux), designed to remind the user to put their phone down periodically) that will regularly interrupt the user - (Optional) Set Space to a short Interruption interval for testing purposes - Launch signal, open a conversation - Tap & hold on the voice message recording button, and talk - Continue holding, and wait for Space to interrupt the user  **Actual result:** signal stops recording the voice message, but does not retain it in any fashion. (This can be confusing for the user, as there is also no feedback that this has happened). **Expected result:** The simplest ""expected behavior"" would be for signal to send the message as-is. This is how Voxer behaves in this situation (though Voxer does not have an option to cancel while recording).  Another, perhaps better option for expected behavior would be for the recording to simply be paused, and for the user interface to wait for the user to return to pressing and holding the record button to continue. (Visual feedback to draw the user's attention to the record button - blinking, throbbing, etc - would be a good idea here). I think this option would fulfill the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). the message is neither lost, nor unexpectedly sent.  A third option would be to provide a small amount of user interface feedback, such as a continue / cancel choice in those situations. as this would require creating additional user interface elements, I do not believe this would be the best choice.  ### Screenshots I will consider adding a screenshot, but I do not believe it offers much help in this.   ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 2 XL **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.25.10  ### Link to debug log I will capture this the next time the issue occurs; I imagine knowing the specific Android events will help.  ### Additional Thoughts I believe the most relevant detail here is that this bug results in an unexpected behavior, and essentially data loss. I've used the example of ""Space"" as an application that interrupts the user with a pop-up, but I suspect any other apps or Services doing the same thing would trigger this issue. A background app requesting root, for example? An alarm clock pop up? Etc. Fortunately (from a user interface standpoint) pop ups do not occur frequently on Android. however, it is a supported Android behavior, and Signal should be able to handle it gracefully.","closed","","GeoMaciolek","2018-09-18T17:08:06Z","2018-11-28T02:09:06Z"

I can send media fine on other WiFi networks and over 4G. I can receive media without issue on the problematic network. Other Signal clients (all Android, but older versions of Android) can send media fine over the problematic network.

I can't see the members and I can't reply.   This is a partial dupe of https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/2581 (closed in cleanup) and probably https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/issues/2257  Getting one of the other members of the group to update it in any way fixes the problem. Since fixing the first group, from the same user to a different group updates the group successfully, so I can't quite reproduce this. I'll update this if it happens again with a more recent debug message.   From desktop the groups seem to still work, but I can't edit the group to fix it.   ### Steps to reproduce - get new device and register same number - receive message to preexisting group  **Actual result:** group is unnamed and you can't reply.  **Expected result:** I can reply to the thread, see the members, or update the group  ### Screenshots  ![screenshot_20180423-193532](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3374110/39164660-83df2318-4735-11e8-820a-e344d6e53846.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 2 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.19.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/c48d4591213cc3d2df566ea545d451c437e222f0602e77f810d95eb839abb62d","closed","wontfix,","benmayne","2018-04-24T03:42:01Z","2022-02-04T07:38:14Z"

Using gendered (male/female) emoji like 🧜 shows different behaviours of the backspace buttons. I have to press the backspace button of my keyboard four times to make the emoji disappear. With the backspace button from the emoji drawer it disappears after one tap (expected behaviour).  This issue may be related to #6676. Threema shows the exact same behaviour, WhatsApp needs three taps for deletion.  ### Steps to reproduce - open a conversation - open emoji drawer - enter an emoji with male/female version in the input field  **Actual result:** I have to press the backspace button four times. **Expected result:** Emoji disappears after one backspace tap.  ### Screenshots No meaningful screenshot possible. And I cannot record a video of my screen at the moment.  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.18.0  ### Link to debug log I intentionally omit a debug log because this issue is easily and reliably reproducible.  ### References Legacy issue: #7288","closed","emoji,","FeuRenard","2018-04-03T10:20:43Z","2018-12-15T00:42:07Z"

Signal won't start. This happened after I installed TWRP 3.2.1 recovery and rooted SuperSU 2.82 on my Samsung Galaxy S5 (SM G900F), running latest Android 6 based stock rom.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have working version (latest play store release) of signal installed - flash TWRP via Odin - flash SuperSU to root via recovery - reboot phone - tap signal icon  **Actual result:** Signal does not start, I only receive the system message ""Signal has stopped"". **Expected result:** Signal should start as before the rooting process.  ### What I have tried so far: According to the log I posted below, I take that Signal seems to be unable to get write access to the folder  `/data/user/0/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/`. I double checked that Signal has all permissions that can be granted via system settings. Also I modified the permissions of the folder `/data/user/0/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/` to 777, but this doesn't help.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S5 (SM G900F) **Android version:**

However, if I type into the search field to filter the conversations list, tapping on the corresponding entry does not show the trash can, and thus the conversation cannot be deleted.  Note: If I select the conversation to view its messages, signal-android, unlike signal-desktop, has no ""delete conversation"" function in the conversation dropdown menu.  Therefore, the only way to delete an entire conversation is to scroll to find it in the unfiltered conversation list, which is inconvenient when the list is long (i.e. I have many conversations).  ### Steps to reproduce - Start signal, and view a long list of of conversations. - long tap the first conversation, notice the trash can, hit the x to dismiss. - hit the magnifying glass, type in a search string that matches a conversation far down the list. - long tap on that conversation  **Actual result:** Long tap on the conversation list entry doesn't do anything. **Expected result:** long tap on the conversation list entry should present the header bar containing the archive and delete buttons, just as it does when there is no search filter active.  ### Device info **Device:** Nextbit Robin **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.24.8","closed","help wanted,","brad2014","2018-08-17T23:31:15Z","2018-09-17T04:45:37Z"

(There is a working PR #3383 from 2015  specifically for #2639, last rebased a year ago).  ### Steps to reproduce - Try to send message to group and make sure sending fails. - Tap the message to enter what I call resend view. - Tap the ""send again"" button for a few group members.  **Actual result:** - As far as I can verify, the message is resent only to the group members for which the button is tapped. (This what makes it different from #2639. Back then the message was resent the the whole group every time a  resend button is tapped.) -  Since the messages is marked successful after the first resend, after leaving the resend view, I cannot enter the view again.  **Expected result:**   - There should be a button ""send again to whole group"", which just does the right thing, i.e., send to members for which the message failed. Currently it's possible to resend only to specific members, but this is not an intended feature.  - Moreover, the message should not be marked successful, as soon as it is resent successfully to only one member.  ### Device info **Device:** HTC 10 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.18.1  ### Link to debug log I refuse.

I have lost some of my contacts avatars but #7544 fixes this by replacing the lost avatars with generic ones. However with Signal 4.18.0 these generic avatars and even some individual avatars need 10 or more seconds to show up. This problem did not occure with 4.17.5.

THE PROBLEM. - Note: Tapping either of **Default** options it opens the same **Signal . Messages** window. The same, tapping on **Calls** opens the same **Calls Signal** window. If opening the same window then in my humble opinion there is window redundancy.  I upgraded Signal from 4.24.8 to 4.25.2 and then 4.25.4.  **Actual result:** Opening Android notification settings in section *Messages* there are duplicate *Default* options. The same problem for *Other* section there are duplicate of *Calls*. **Expected result:** There should be only single setting for *Messages* section | *Default* and *Other* section | _Calls_.  ### Screenshots ![android_notifications](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10895030/44509297-a7d55b80-a6b1-11e8-98da-75a9de43bcd3.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** LG Nexus 5X **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.25.4  ### Link to debug log  Not applicable, because it is UI problem.","closed","","igor2x","2018-08-23T07:03:32Z","2019-01-31T15:16:59Z"

The list is empty. Additionally, all of my contacts (after exchanging several messages) are shown as phone numbers only. There is no contact info added based on my Android contacts. Signal only shows additional info if a contact added name and picture directly in their Signal app.  - ""Refresh"" (by pressing either refresh or gesture) has no effect (rotating arrow is shown for about two seconds) - Deleting Signal from Accounts in Android preferences has no effect (it is removed, can't be readded) - Reinstalling Signal has no effect (there are still no contacts) - Deleting all of my contacts on the device and readding them has no effect (Signal still doesn't recognize them) - Restarting the device and/or Signal or deleting Signal's app data/cache has also no effect - Deleting storage and cache of Android's contact storage (com.android.providers.contacts) has no effect (after synchronizing contacts in Android again, I open Signal and it still does not recognize my contacts) - Creating several contacts only on the device (without synchronization) has also no effect since Signal doesn't show these contacts, too - In chats, I can select ""Add to contacts"" (although this contact is already stored on the device). After that I can add the contact to my Android contacts and it shows that the contact information has been added. When I return to Signal, ""Add to contacts"" is still shown and I can repeat this process forever.  It seems that Signal can't access my contacts, however, Signal Desktop which is synchronized using this device recognizes my contact list and shows the expected names and photos of my contacts (only in Signal Desktop). Signal Desktop also immediately updates my contacts when I refresh them on my device.  Signal (on Android) does show all of my contacts when I set Signal as my default SMS app. Then Signal shows names and phone numbers, but after selecting an entry the name disappears and only the phone number is shown.  Originally, I encountered this bug in Signal 4.17.5, however, it is still present in 4.18.3.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Signal on the device with contacts already on the device - Open Signal and activate it - Press 🖋 (bottom right) and there ""Refresh""  **Actual result:** Signal doesn't show any contacts **Expected result:** Signal shows a subset of contacts on my device who are also Signal users  ### Possible bug fix I fixed this issue by completing [the steps mentioned below](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7681#issuecomment-383920754).  ### Screenshots  ![screenshot_20180415-123904](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35793040/38777690-33100d60-40ac-11e8-9543-638830308bff.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G4 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.18.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/6ceb1bc491226c888c1f2890c3b8cd428dafc247025bdf388cc7e9ff31d5d6a7  _Edit:_ Added further information. _Edit 2:_ Bug is still present in Signal 4.18.3. _Edit 3:_ Possible fix found.","closed","","ghost","2018-04-15T11:02:06Z","2019-03-28T23:47:42Z"

Some information: There are several ways to scroll an image in the image viewer, one can use two fingers and do the pinch zoom, but you can also do a tap and hold on the image and then slide your finger up and down. Sliding your finger up zooms out and sliding it down zooms in.  Using this tap and hold style zoom sometimes leads to the image being ""inverted"", it is actually a point reflection. For this I need to fling my finger up quite fast, please have a look at the video.  ### Steps to reproduce - send or receive an image - click on the image - tap and hold on the image and fling your finger up really fast (this does not work every time, sometimes you are not fast enough, so try this a couple of times)  **Actual result:** The image is point reflected **Expected result:** The image should not be point reflected and zoomed out maximally. ### Screenshots  **VIDEO:** https://ptpb.pw/ZGjw.mp4   ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia Z5 Compact (E5823) **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.23.4  (also happens on Redmi 4, Android version 6.0.1, same Signal version) ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/5174ee67b7a4723a93a56a6571b92370f30820511b1d93930043416af2597afd","closed","wontfix,","He-Ro","2018-08-01T15:13:17Z","2022-02-04T16:16:52Z"

I connect my phone to the WiFi and Chrome works flawlessly, everything works flawlessly really. Same thing on my grandmother's phone.  Well, everything except one thing; Signal. Signal just doesn't work and I have no idea why. The messages just keep spinning. I downloaded Allo to check if that works... and it works flawlessly. Both regular messages and incognito messages work 100%.  ### Steps to reproduce I dunno. Going to my hospital in Sweden and trying it out most likely isn't going to be an option. Maybe the logs can help?  **Actual result:** Signal doesn't work, but Allo does **Expected result:** Signal works just like Allo  ### Device info Moto G4 on Nougat (My grandmother's phone.

For example, if I tap the download button overlay, Signal sometimes doesn't seem to react in any way. Sometimes, the download starts, but afterwards the download button layer doesn't disappear, although the picture is successfully downloaded. Sometimes it simply works, but most of the time it doesn't. Although I'm not sure, I think it always happened in group conversations. It doesn't matter whether I'm on 4G or on WIFI.  I don't remember this happening even once while I was using v4.23.4, so I guess this is caused by some change in the meantime.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive a bunch of pictures (in a group?) - Try to download them by (quickly?) tapping the download button overlay for some/all of them  **Actual result:** Sometimes no reaction, sometimes successful download, but download button overlay is still visible and active (like I could download that picture once again) **Expected result:** Upon successful download, the download button overlay alsways disappears.  ### Screenshots ![signal-2018-10-19-111441](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23237468/47209719-54217e80-d391-11e8-9ae5-e3feef041b69.jpg)   ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G4 Plus **Android version:** 7.0.0 (stock) **Signal version:** 4.28.x and newer (4.29.4 is still affected)  ### Link to debug log v4.28.0: https://debuglogs.org/5b605f72497c175f38b2c72256ece9d2ff2a84f53065e80f1d6e0b8d9432d6e3 v4.29.4: https://debuglogs.org/4d293cf91ee8c506a1be9afd217d82af0863d687dad137e9e977d33c22333a0e","closed","wontfix,","PiCob","2018-10-19T07:26:43Z","2022-02-04T17:17:07Z"

In The Netherlands, it is extremely common for surnames to have a _tussenvoegsel_*, which is generally not capitalized and not really considered part of the surname (for example when indexing). A well known example would be Vincent van Gogh, who would be indexed under 'G', and his initials would be 'VvG', or, if there are size constraints, 'VG'. Right now, with a large list of Dutch contacts, many appear as 'Lv', 'Pv', 'Wv', and 'Pd'. Using this (lowercase) first letter _tussenvoegsel_ as an identifier looks, at best, extremely weird, and possibly just plain wrong. Obviously, this is only a bug if the intended behavior is to show a persons initials in that circle, if it is just to have more defining characteristics in that circle from any random letters from the name, then this report could probably simply be closed.  *Optional reading: [English wiki: tussenvoegsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussenvoegsel)  Possible solutions: - Don't care and ignore this. I'm serious, though it bothers me a great deal I have to admit it's a small issue. - Ignore any lowercase letters. This would work for The Netherlands, but I don't know how capitalization is done in these cases in other countries (e.g. Belgian 'van Damme', German 'von Beethoven', Italian 'di Caprio', etc.), and wether it is acceptable as an initial if they do capitalize the _tussenvoegsel_. - Just stick to one single letter and close this can of worms! This is my preferred solution, though I understand why the change was made.  Thanks for all your time and hard work!  ### Steps to reproduce - Add contact 'Ludwig von Beethoven', without avatar  **Actual result:** Shows up as 'Lv'  **Expected result:** All of 'LvB', 'LB', or just 'L', would be better than 'Lv'  ### Device info **Device:** Sony Xperia Z5C **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.29.4","closed","","bepaald","2018-10-21T07:19:35Z","2018-10-25T00:07:59Z"

However, when an incoming Signal call rings and a bluetooth headset is paired and connected, pressing the multifunction button on the headset does not answer the Signal call. The call has to be answered manually from the phone screen, only then does the bluetooth set engage.  Even more surprisingly, pressing the multifunction button while a Signal call is in progress (and the BT set in use) has the effect of handing the call over to the regular earpiece - rather than the expected result of ending the call.  The same issue has been observed on Pixel 2 (stock 8.1) and on Nexus 5 (LineageOS 14.1).  ### Steps to reproduce - receive a Signal call, having a bluetooth headset paired and connected - try to answer the call from the bluetooth headset  **Actual result:**  The call keeps ringing. **Expected result:** The call is answered, similarly to regular phone call.  - while on a Signal call and speaking through a bluetooth headset - try to hang up by pressing the button on the headset  **Actual result:**  The call gets handed over to the earpiece. **Expected result:** The call is ended.   ### Screenshots Not relevant   ### Device info **Bluetooth headset:** Aukey EP-B40 Bluetooth 4.1 **Device:** Google Pixel 2 **Android version:** Stock Android 8.1.0 - OPM2.171019.029 **Signal version:** 4.18.3  ### Link to debug log Trying to pick up a Signal call by pressing the bluetooth button (nothing happens) https://debuglogs.org/e98e666571435c9a13e6cac176ecdd4eda57ddd60a7127381c0c73625df697e0  Trying to end a Signal call by pressing the bluetooth button (call gets handed over to earpiece) https://debuglogs.org/789eec7e8c8e1138cf86a1fe61ea803bcc1df35bbb80b4f21edc057eeb581b0a","open","acknowledged,","cegg1","2018-04-14T14:29:27Z","2022-07-08T15:14:02Z"

The feature was working without issue when it was originally implemented. I do not have an SD card and I do not see any exceptions in the debug logs, so I think this is different than the existing issues on the repo. Apologies if it is not.  When the feature was working, my backup item count was ~24k items. Now it gets into that range and slows down (media messages and such) like before, but then continues very rapidly up to ~74k items. Once it finishes, no backup file has been created at /storage/emulated/0/Signal/Backups as they previously were and settings property correctly displays the day and time of the last successful backup file.  ### Steps to reproduce - Manually trigger backup or let one trigger automatically   **Actual result:** Signal does not create a new backup **Expected result:** Signal should create a new backup  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 2 XL **Android version:** 8.1.0, OPM2.171019.029.B1, May 5 patch **Signal version:** 4.20.2, 4.20.4  ### Link to debug log 4.20.2: https://debuglogs.org/236fd96194c0f416920df0195dfa5accbea6ec14318f13d892d66569bfbac707 4.20.4: https://debuglogs.org/89f96691eb686c5082e12eeb1b2a644aaed2679537d2c423ac178e655c08578e","closed","","RichJeanes","2018-05-25T16:19:54Z","2018-07-13T08:47:59Z"

I'm not sure if this is a bug or intentional (seems like an odd bug to have been introduced accidentally, but I can't see why you'd want to reduce the palette, especially with such similar colors). Either way, the color selection is now much too limiting, and should be restored. I should also add that two colors are *extremely* similar to another two, making the options effectively more limited: red and slightly-orangish-red; and teal and, uh, teal no. 2.  In individual conversations the color selection doesn't matter too much, but in group conversations it is really helpful to have different colors to quickly tell the members apart (especially if people's circle icons have both the same letter!). Now several conversations of mine have two or more people in it with the same color.   ### Steps to reproduce - Go to conversation settings and then the color option  **Actual result:**  Note there are only 9 options (of which two are very similar to another two).  **Expected result:** 15 color options being presented to choose from.  ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 5 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.24.7","closed","","CaviaPorcellus","2018-08-04T03:23:36Z","2018-08-19T07:36:46Z"

This occurs regardless of whether or not the e-mail address is stored as a contact in the phone.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send an SMS through phone provider's e-mail-to-SMS gateway. - Open message on phone.  - Click top bar to reveal contact options. Signal will crash each time, before the menu is displayed.  **Actual result:** Signal crashes when trying to open the contact menu for an e-mail contact  **Expected result:** Signal should display the contact menu, as it does for all other contacts.   ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 2 XL **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.19.3  ### Link to debug log  [Debug log](https://ncry.pt/p/UeOn#oWg19YuBDZfExJwP_3Z3-omNim4G1iR_kt_2mdBRq0A)","closed","","JacobHenner","2018-05-31T17:51:36Z","2018-06-22T20:25:51Z"
"","8145","Crash when opening a ""too old"" message found by fulltext search","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Signal crashes every time that I search for an older message (using the relatively new fulltext search function), and then tap on the message. I suspect the root cause for this might be the same as for #4667, but because it doesn't just happen when manually scrolling up but also when viewing a message directly from search, plus because that bug report was closed years ago, I am opening a new bug report for this specific behaviour.  As far as I can tell, the criterion for the message age for which the bug happens is that it's not immediately loaded into the conversation in which it appears when opening said conversation normally (without search), i.e. where the message is so old that in order to see it you would have to scroll further ""up"" than the default scrollable text in the conversation, which I think displays only the last 500 messages.  This happens in all conversations, regardless of whether it's a group chat or not, as far as I can tell.  ### Steps to reproduce - Do a fulltext search from the Signal main screen, for a search term you know appears on an older message.  - tap on the search result of that older message  **Actual result:** Signal crashes **Expected result:** Signal displays the message that was found by fulltext search  ### Device info **Device:** Oneplus 3 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.24.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/046a9e96d9bd268941e7ba9d7cc0816a00e6d485d29dd4d906aaa52e06ef466d","closed","","Natanji","2018-08-28T11:36:57Z","2018-08-28T20:26:06Z"

This is something I have experienced with Signal over many years but have failed to reliably reproduce. It seems to happen at random, but always noticeable during the process of sharing links between apps. Finally got off my ass to get the crash stack trace via Android Studio.  ### Steps to reproduce  - (by chance) turn on phone - using [Reddit Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync), share a link to a reddit post - when the [Android share context menu](https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nexus2cee_2016-03-12-15.20.29.png) appears, Signal crashes in the background (but bringing up a report/dismiss dialog in the foreground)  I feel these steps may be a way to reproduce the symptom, not the problem.  I have a strong suspicion that it has something to do with a race condition on boot. Maybe Signal is trying to do something during `android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED` before the Android file system has completely loaded?  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  - be able to share links without it affecting Signal - try to run Signal. it will crash.  uncaught exception is `java.security.InvalidKeyException: Keystore operation failed`  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  - can share links between other apps without Signal crashing - Signal still works  ### Screenshots  the initial actions ![screenrecord_2018-10-28-07-08-03 mp4_snapshot_00 02_ 2018 10 28_08 39 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59689/47609632-51f4a980-da8e-11e8-95b4-f12cd7e2af0a.jpg)  ![screenrecord_2018-10-28-07-08-03 mp4_snapshot_00 03_ 2018 10 28_08 40 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59689/47609633-54ef9a00-da8e-11e8-9b9b-bf5a43a4288d.jpg)  crash as the menu appears, before anything is even shared ![screenrecord_2018-10-28-07-08-03 mp4_snapshot_00 04_ 2018 10 28_08 40 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59689/47609634-56b95d80-da8e-11e8-9ed3-b3783e9a3499.jpg)  clicking back ![screenrecord_2018-10-28-07-08-03 mp4_snapshot_00 07_ 2018 10 28_08 40 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59689/47609635-58832100-da8e-11e8-94c5-fc5ad866d2ed.jpg)  another crash ![screenrecord_2018-10-28-07-08-03 mp4_snapshot_00 08_ 2018 10 28_08 41 04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59689/47609637-5c16a800-da8e-11e8-88f4-71b7dc9621ee.jpg)  Signal data is now corrupt and fails to load ![screenrecord_2018-10-28-07-08-03 mp4_snapshot_00 17_ 2018 10 28_08 41 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59689/47609638-5e790200-da8e-11e8-9be9-6692e82abd20.jpg)   ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Z5 Compact **Android version:** 6.0 **Signal version:** 4.29.7  ### Link to debug log   ``` ?

After much prodding from me and much delay, they use the link and type in the code. I see the change reflected when I ""Reset Secure Connection"". All is well until I receive notifications that they are both back on Signal. I ask them if they have reinstalled, but neither person has. Now Signal is attempting to send encrypted messages to them again. This has happened twice to one of the contacts after unregistering both times.  I have even unregistered my own number, cleared the cache and started out with no backups or imports. Nothing has changed after this last effort.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send [Signal >> Unregister](https://signal.org/signal/unregister/) to Contacts. - They successfully unregister from Signal. (Profits!) - After an indeterminate amount of time, an hour to a few hours, I am notified that they are Signal Users again.  **Actual result:** Contacts do not receive my SMS due to Signal seeing them as Signal Users. Unregistration seems ineffective. **Expected result:** Upon unregistering with Signal Servers, the contacts would no longer be listed as Signal contacts and communication would fall back to unencrypted SMS.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel XL (Gen-1) **Android version:** 8.1.0 (Beta Channel) **Signal version:** Me: 4.19.1 (Beta Channel) - Contacts: Both use iOS Devices.  ### Link to debug log  I haven't any log at the moment, due to trying to wipe the slate clean to no avail.

Selecting outside the text works. Additionally it's possible to accidentally tap the phone number which opens the dialer of the phone app. Long-tapping the number - without already being in selection mode - doesn't enter the selection mode but opens the phone app, too.  ### Steps to reproduce - open a conversation with a Signal user, who is not a phone contact - call the contact - see the log with the contact's phone number - long-tap another message - tap the text of the status message  **Actual result:** Phone app is opened when you hit the number or the message is not selected. **Expected result:** The status message gets selected. The number should not be linkified in selection mode, which is already done for normal messages.  ### Screenshots Tapping ""Called"" doesn't select the status message.

I first attempted this operation in version 4.15.5, then again in a version between 4.15.5 and 4.19.3 (4.18.x?), and now most recently (today: May 17) again in 4.19.3. Signal has crashed in the same manner in all three attempts. As best I can recall, 4.18.x did not even have an option present in the menu for importing a plaintext backup file.  ### Steps to reproduce - launch Signal - follow the steps in the documentation under ""[How do I restore from a legacy plaintext backup?](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360001890291)"" - Signal crashes  **Actual result:** Signal crashes (Android Oreo 8.1.0 reports: Signal stopped responding) **Expected result:** No crash.

On opening Signal I instantly received a number of new notifications. After checking the logfile it seems that the GCM notifications are received however they're not processed. Based on the logfile I guess that something went wrong while handling the first notification and that prevents handling the later received notifications however that's just my guess. Below are the message details of the related notifications.  Note that I could not link the GCMBroadcastReceiver message from 09:39:22.117 to a specific message.  I'm not sure if it's related but I should mention that the initial message was the first Signal message I've received from that contact.  message contact 1.

This appears to be the same symptoms (Signal is unable to create a backup and no visible error is presented to the user) but with a documentable solution:  ### Steps to reproduce - Settings > Enable the backup feature - Follow the tool-tip steps (Save security numbers) - Manually invoke ""Create Backup"" - An icon momentarily flashes in the notification bar and instantly disappears - Signal displays no error to the application user  **Actual result:** Nothing happens **Expected result:** A backup should be created or an error displayed  ### Link to debug log adb logcat: ``` [..] I ChatsPreferenceFragment: Queing backup...

To further that idea, perhaps wrapping [File tempFile = File.createTempFile(""backup"", ""tmp"", StorageUtil.getBackupCacheDirectory(context));](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/f9adb4e4554a44fd65b77320e34bf4bccf7924ce/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/jobs/LocalBackupJob.java#L70) in it's own if/try condition would help isolate this behaviour from the more generic `NoExternalStorageException`.","closed","","davidsuart","2018-08-31T15:33:13Z","2018-09-16T19:48:36Z"

In some cases, it looks silly, and in others, such as with enormous text, it makes the text field unusable (or at least undesirable)  Since Signal can't send texts of different sizes, colors, boldness, etc. we should sanitize text that gets pasted into the app.   I would like to note that actually sending the message will strip the formatting and not cause any actual problems. This mostly just looks confusing to users and could potentially be very confusing depending on the nature of the formatted text pasted into Signal.   ### Steps to reproduce - Navigate to a site with rich text, such as this one https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/debord/society.htm - Copy and paste some text. I chose:   > 1. > In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles   since the ""1."" in that quote is formatted with the `` HTML element.  - Open Signal and paste the text into a message.  **Actual result:** The external markup has found its way into Signal!  **Expected result:** The markup should be stripped from the selected text as if the user were to have just typed the pasted quote by hand.  ### Screenshots Here's a screenshot of Signal after following the steps outlined above ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22125581/43484873-9d5cc2dc-94dd-11e8-841c-0de55eb83fc1.png) As you can see, the formatting, size, and alignment of the ""1.""'s `` element is preserved    ### Device info **Device:** Alcatel_5044R **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.24.5","open","acknowledged,","bitmold","2018-07-31T20:21:19Z","2022-06-06T12:07:31Z"

The database of my conversations is old (3 years at least, even though I do not remeber exactly when I installed it for the first time) and big (thousand of texts, pics, video and documents). * I've deleted the cache - data are still there - but nothing has changed. * I've deleted my passphrase and locked Signal with my fingerprint but nothing has changed. * My phone is synchronized with a couple of devices where I can regularly see received texts. * According to Android all my data are still there.  ### Possible related bugs It seems that my bug could be related to this one.  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7386  In the case I've opened a duplicate, I do apologize in advance.

I also believe this issue is correlated with this (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7726) and this (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8118) issue: the reason being that I too cannot change my profile picture, however when switching to the internal memory I was able to do that too. As such the problem is probably caused by how Signal access the device's storage.","closed","","aleb2000","2018-08-28T09:28:44Z","2018-08-28T18:19:32Z"

I am at work in the office, and I am connected over corporate Wifi. She is at home and  connected over our home Wifi.  I receive the message when I get home and open Signal to send someone else a message. That is on 19:28. Between work and home, and I'm on my data plan (no hiccups there, using my traffic app while commuting).  This has happened to me before with other persons, but this is the first time I am able to capture a debug log from both ends.  No Wifi or battery saving schemes active. Both phones are on stock Android.  ### Steps to reproduce Unknown. Problem is not consistent.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) I would expect the message to arrive much sooner.  ### Screenshots  ![wp_20180919_06_38_09_pro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13982083/45731901-15ee3f00-bbda-11e8-9104-c9c1a9645df9.jpg)   ### Device info We have both identical phones with virtually identical setup.   **Device:** OnePlus 3 (A3003) **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.25.10  ### Link to debug log  Mine: https://debuglogs.org/b30c9b21afe71fe776fca3398b2dbcf3d5a5ef3f640579ad969dc6b06c46e48b Hers: https://debuglogs.org/a86492892182f9c8b2c2a5934ac9f195578280f05d1f3d79f6e47bcc13122f0a","closed","","Ceaus","2018-09-19T04:55:34Z","2018-10-02T20:14:45Z"

It displays a notification saying a new version is available, but tapping on the notification does nothing.  ### Steps to reproduce - obtain a Fairphone 2 and put Fairphone Open OS on it (so, no Google Play etc.) - go back in time 6 months and install Signal from the signal.org website - do at least one Signal update, so now running 4.19.3 - now observe that Signal knows it wants to update but is able to do so  **Actual result:** Notification about update is displayed,  Tapping it does nothing.  No way to get rid of the notificiation AFAICT.  **Expected result:** Tapping the notification should update Signal.  Dismissing the notification should make it go away for a while at lest.  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** 6.0.1, FPOOS 18.04.1 **Signal version:** 4.19.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/87122f89047138d9a773947e97591d313ed0c3aa9007dfe3db2fc3479f5cfc3c","closed","","ijackson","2018-06-24T16:29:18Z","2019-11-24T14:16:09Z"

I use signal as my default sms app. Signal has not detected that the user no longer has Signal installed, and keeps sending messages to his Signal, which he obviously does not get. I can send him SMS messages manually from the app, but I have to remember to make this change every time I open the app. I also can not make this choice when replying via notification actions. Either this behavior should be fixed, or defaulting to SMS should be an option between users.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install signal on a friends phone - Send a message to him - Delete it from his phone - Send a message to him  **Actual result:** It goes to Signal and he does not receive it. **Expected result:** It goes to SMS as Signal is no longer installed.  ### Device info  His info is unknown.

With the current version, introduced in 4.25, it is now only possible for a user to select a single line at a time, which makes it near impossible to redact large portions of irrelevant debug log.  A privacy-conscious user might want to do this to prevent their being fingerprinting, as the debug logs are public and contain several items that could potentially identify them, including: * Millisecond-precision log entries (which network-observers could use to de-anonymize by correlation) * MAC codes (which could be compared to real packets)  Once a user was identified, further information (especially metadata, using the final 2 digits of interacting phone numbers) could potentially be used. An adversary that had network-level traces and some sophistication could create an automated system to monitor debug logs/reports for information matching a set of users that were of interest, and then harvest this data when it became available.  ### Steps to reproduce - Select the triple-dot menu in the top right corner. - Go to Settings - Go to Advanced - Click ""Submit debug log"" - Select a word by pressing for a long time, then try to expand the selection to cover multiple lines.    **Actual result:**  You can't :( **Expected result:**  You could select and delete irrelevant lines. Modifying the times to either have noise added or be less than millisecond precision could also help preserve anonymity. Perhaps having a ""share lots of info"" vs. a ""share minimal info"" could be another method.   ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola XT1528 **Android version:** 5.1 **Signal version:** 4.29.2  ### Link to debug log That's what this issue is about :)","closed","wontfix,","pshephard","2018-10-17T18:20:45Z","2022-02-04T16:16:39Z"

Importing this backup on the XZ1c repeatedly failed with Signal crashing. I found a workaround by applying with the S4 for the beta-programm, installing Signal 4.18.2 and creating a backup, which was successfully imported on the XZ1c with Signal 4.17.5. Signal worked fine the previous four days.  However after the update to Signal 4.18.3 last night, Signal won't start anymore and kept crashing on starting the app with the following exception (obained via adb logcat):  ``` 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: pool-3-thread-1 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 12153 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteException: Can't upgrade read-only database from version 4 to 6: /data/user/0/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/databases/signal.db 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteOpenHelper.getReadableDatabase(SQLiteOpenHelper.java:252) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteOpenHelper.getReadableDatabase(SQLiteOpenHelper.java:214) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.helpers.SQLCipherOpenHelper.getReadableDatabase(SQLCipherOpenHelper.java:181) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.SmsDatabase.getExpirationStartedMessages(SmsDatabase.java:668) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.service.ExpiringMessageManager$LoadTask.run(ExpiringMessageManager.java:57) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1162) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:636) 04-17 12:20:05.681 12153 12178 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:764) ```  So I tried to recover the previous days' backups made by Signal 4.17.5 on the XZ1c, which kept failing as well (after processing about 12000 messages which is the exact same crash behaviour as seen four days ago when importing my 4.17.5 backup from the S4 on the XZ1c) with exception:  ``` 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: AsyncTask #4 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 30956 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.RuntimeException: An error occurred while executing doInBackground() 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.AsyncTask$3.done(AsyncTask.java:353) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.finishCompletion(FutureTask.java:383) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.setException(FutureTask.java:252) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:271) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.AsyncTask$SerialExecutor$1.run(AsyncTask.java:245) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1162) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:636) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:764) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Failed to allocate a 1174457208 byte allocation with 2899518 free bytes and 509MB until OOM, max allowed footprint 5799038, growth limit 536870912 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupImporter$BackupRecordInputStream.readFrame(FullBackupImporter.java:238) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupImporter$BackupRecordInputStream.readFrame(FullBackupImporter.java:189) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup.FullBackupImporter.importFile(FullBackupImporter.java:67) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.RegistrationActivity$2.doInBackground(RegistrationActivity.java:372) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.RegistrationActivity$2.doInBackground(RegistrationActivity.java:364) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.AsyncTask$2.call(AsyncTask.java:333) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266) 04-17 20:50:59.884 30956 31431 E AndroidRuntime: 	... 4 more ``` Luckily I still had the above mentioned workaround-backup (created with Signal 4.18.2 on the S4) which I was able to successfully import.

And my signal tells me it's going to stop working in six days. The log if from the last try, from 4.15.5 to 4.18.3 ``` [ 04-17 22:51:36.969  1400: 3234 E/ActivityTrigger ] activityStartTrigger: not whiteListedcom.google.android.packageinstaller/com.and

This affects only groups, not 1-to-1 conversations. I tested with three groups.

However, none of this seems to matter as the result is the same blank image in all groups.  ### Steps to reproduce - send an image to a group from the Desktop client - view the group on your Android master device  **Actual result:** The image is shown as blank space, tapping it doesn't do anything **Expected result:** Image should render, tapping it should open the gallery view  ### Screenshots ![screenshot_20180621-113757](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/174176/41707956-0216022a-7548-11e8-8d9d-73a883257233.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Lenovo Moto G4 Play **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.21.2 **Desktop version:** 1.13.0-beta.1  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/950063b5edc224eb1f106e44d46a1c8535a45c2837d9032f06acbc552b1b7d61  cc: @kpuljek (#7917)","closed","","2-4601","2018-06-21T08:45:11Z","2018-06-22T17:40:01Z"

If you then rotate your phone to portrait the quick reply overlay is too wide and shorter (as if it still uses the landscape overlay dimensions?), resulting in the right part of the overlay to be off-screen. This means that you can't send the quick reply because the send button is also off-screen, and your sent messages are also only partially shown.  For reference, this bug was reported before but closed during the spring cleaning: #5135. I opened this issue since the problem still exists in the current version of Signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - have a notification for a new Signal message - open an app that supports landscape mode - rotate you device to landscape mode - click on the reply button in the notification of your Signal message - rotate to portrait mode  **Actual result:** The reply overlay is too wide, moving the send button off-screen **Expected result:** The reply overlay should look be less wide and look the same as when you would have opened the quick reply overlay directly in portrait mode  ### Screenshots This shows the problem (I selected a message as you then also see that options at the top are not all visible, i.e. the quote message option is off-screen): ![screenshot_20180526-120200 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/696839/40575282-6dfbfcd0-60e2-11e8-9046-679c6e4c9133.png)  This shows how the quick reply overlay should look like and does look like when I open the quick reply directly in portrait mode: ![screenshot_20180526-120354 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/696839/40575300-c7cfc796-60e2-11e8-88f6-f86e0a6437be.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Google Nexus 5 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.19.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/17ebfee968d3a9810521f90dea659e3b07fbeb2072233ffd3cc82beafaf2d841","closed","","siccovansas","2018-05-26T10:35:16Z","2021-02-23T17:49:07Z"

If you tilt the phone 90º to make the image ""widescreen"" then it's not actually mirrored.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Open a chat with your local hot babe (or with your mom) 2.

Whether the picture is attached as a photo or as a file does not matter.   It looks like Signal recognizes the device as a low memory device (96, low-mem device).   (Currently the only way to keep the text readable is to create a PDF file from the image, but that's pretty cumbersome for quickly submitting a single image.)  ### Steps to reproduce - Use an android device with 1 GB RAM (?) - Take a picture of a written text (resolution 3264x1836 pixels) - Attach the picture to a signal message - Send the message  **Actual result:** The picture is shrunk to a miniature image with 408x230 pixels with unreadable text. **Expected result:** The text on the picture should be readable (for example with a resolution of 2400x1350 pixels).  ### Screenshots   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy A3 2015 (SM-A300F) **Android version:** 5.0.2 **Signal version:** 4.25.10  ### Link to debug log  (Sorry, no debug log - the Samsung A300F is not my own device.)","closed","","AndrewPy","2018-09-16T13:46:58Z","2018-09-29T06:39:23Z"

After leaving my phone for a while and coming back, I tried to verify that the backup was finished but noticed that Signal was asking me for my password (showing that the app had been closed/killed). It was also showing the last backup date as ""Never"".  I could successfully do a backup while the phone is charging and I keep the screen on. I investigated adb logcat and can confirm that Signal is killed for excessive CPU usage.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start the Signal Backup (doesn't matter if it is the initial backup process or you just press on ""Create Backup"" again) - Unplug the phone from the power source (mine was sitting at around 69% battery at the time) - Turn off the screen and wait for 15-20 minutes  **Actual result:** The Signal app is killed for using excessive CPU resources, which also kills the backup process. Upon entering Signal a user-defined unlock password needs to be entered again. A user might think the backup is finished (since the notification disappeared) but it isn't: when going to the Backups part of the settings, the ""Last backup"" will still say ""Never"" (or whatever the last successful backup date was). **Expected result:** The Signal backup keeps running and backs up Signal.  ### Device info **Device:** Oneplus 3 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.17.5  ### Link to debug log Debug log from within Signal isn't available because the app is killed/crashes and the log from within signal will only show the current run's log. adb logcat clearly shows that Signal is getting killed and afterwards its services get restarted:   ``` 04-03 15:13:25.496  7628  7684 I OHPD    : [BgDetect]detect excessive cpu on process org.thoughtcrime.securesms(pid : 6243) level 3 usage 41 04-03 15:13:27.474  7628  7684 I ActivityManager: Killing 6243:org.thoughtcrime.securesms/u0a195 (adj 200): [BgDetect] kill org.thoughtcrime.securesms (uid 10195) level 3 ... 04-03 15:13:27.613  7628  9575 I WindowManager: WIN DEATH: Window{c62f05c u0 org.thoughtcrime.securesms/org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ApplicationPreferencesActivity} 04-03 15:13:27.620  7628 22261 I WindowManager: WIN DEATH: Window{d9c8f05 u0 org.thoughtcrime.securesms/org.thoughtcrime.securesms.RoutingActivity} ... 04-03 15:13:27.644  7628  7661 D ActivityManager: Process org.thoughtcrime.securesms has 3 services 04-03 15:13:27.645  7628  7661 W ActivityManager: Scheduling restart of crashed service org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.service.KeyCachingService in 10840ms 04-03 15:13:27.645  7628  7661 W ActivityManager: Scheduling restart of crashed service org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.service.MessageRetrievalService in 10839ms 04-03 15:13:27.645  7628  7661 W ActivityManager: Scheduling restart of crashed service org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.service.GenericForegroundService in 20839ms ``` (Backup was started at around 15:00)","closed","","Natanji","2018-04-03T13:24:13Z","2018-10-08T05:43:02Z"

To clarify, let's say that in All Media, there are the images A B C D E in that order, and A through D do not display when tapped but E does; then I can keep swiping to the right to display D, C, B and A.  Now the thing I consistently noticed about the images for which this works and for which it doesn't is: the images that don't show while tapping are from messages from other people. The images that I posted to the group chat load consistently (showing ""You"" in the headline). Indeed, this is 100% reproducible for me, see below - but only in group chats. 1-to-1 chats are not affected.  I have confirmed with a friend's phone which is still on 4.17.5 that this problem does not exist in their phone, so perhaps this is a regression introduced by pull #7527 since this changed the All Media stuff.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open a new group chat (even with only a single other person) - Have them send you an image - Open ""All Media"" for the conversation - Tapping the image thumbnail results in the media activity opening but not displaying the image (everything is black and the sender's name is not in the headline) - Now send an own image to the other person - The image you sent is possible to access via ""All Media"", and by the swiping workaround you can also access the image the other party sent; but directly accessing their image still doesn't work.  **Actual result:** When tapping an image thumbnail in ""all media"" that was sent by another person, it is not shown. **Expected result:** The image is shown, just like media from messages that I sent myself.  ### Device info **Device:** Oneplus 3 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.18.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/a8604af1dcbc4a81f2a860aa1bde352e286fdca3887cc19a974ea2e586607c9d","closed","","Natanji","2018-04-05T13:38:21Z","2018-04-05T14:49:56Z"

That phone died a few days ago and I have now a Sony Xperia XZs with Android 8.0.0. Installed Signal Beta again and set it up with my phone number, but then realized that there is no ""import"" function to import the backups from the newly commited backups function (commit 24e573e537639f6f8ff40fd774cf9ff079bbacce (""Support for full backup/restore to sdcard""), I assume).  After copying the Signal backups into `/mnt/sdcard/Signal/Backups` I went to `App Info` and `Clear Data` on Signal. Started Signal and now Signal was able to import the ~1 GB encrypted backup file and Signal appeared to work. Linked a Signal v1.7.0-beta.2 desktop (Linux) instance to it and both Signal on Android and on the Desktop continued to work for a few hours. But then the ""Signal has stopped"" screens kept popping up (even though I wasn't even using Signal actively). Now I cannot start Signal on Android anymore, every attempt to start it gives another ""Signal has stopped"" screen (which goes away very quickly and one has to be very quick to hit the ""Send feedback"" button.  ### Steps to reproduce  1. Start Signal 2. `Signal has stopped` window appears.  ### Screenshots   ### Device info **Device:** Sony Xperia XZs Dual-SIM (G8232) **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.18.0  ### Link to debug log [adb logcat](https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/-H4CVqxe~MODryQqScmJgw).

This was caused by an NPE in `ViewUtil.animateIn()`.

I will still include the steps I took leading up to the initial crash.  - Open Google's ""Photos"" application - Choose an image to share and share to a Signal contact - Observe ""Signal has crashed!""   **Actual result:** Signal crashes. **Expected result:**  Signal should share the image to the chosen contact  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Nexus 6 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.28.0  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/c48af2b032a0ffba168a0f2dcc2be2defdbd26c1be3af1bc4f92a328133525ef","closed","","junitas","2018-10-04T14:35:52Z","2022-01-31T14:36:44Z"

I've tried it dozens of times across the last couple of versions of Signal. The backup starts normally, it shows the notification and the backed up messages counter in the settings increases very fast initially and then slows down but steadily continues (I think when it starts backing up photos and videos) until the notification is suddenly gone after which I find no backup file in the Signal folder.  This is an old installation of Signal, it was probably installed in the second half of 2014 (when it was still called TextSecure). Signal is listed as being around 4GB big, but there is enough space on the device for the backup. Sometimes the backup stops before the Signal backup tmp file reaches 1GB, but I've seen the tmp file reach 3GB+ as well when it stopped. Sometimes the failed backup tmp file is automatically removed by Signal and sometimes it lingers around till I delete it.  Issue #8024 looks related, but in my case the counter doesn't continue.  Please let me know if I can clear anything up or try something. I really want the backup to work as it currently blocks me from moving to another phone :).  ### Steps to reproduce - Start a backup - Wait till the backup notification is gone  **Actual result:** There is no backup file in the Signal folder **Expected result:** There should be a backup file in the Signal folder  ### Device info **Device:** Fairphone 1 **Android version:** 4.2.2 **Signal version:** 4.24.8  ### Link to debug log - debug log for 4.23.4: https://debuglogs.org/e8772891bdc08c09f6f4ec74e5908753529a0ebb7427502b20f6707a2ea34133  - debug log for 4.24.8: https://debuglogs.org/707eb8cea4a2255693e464a273d15fadf1ed09e281abccad7b450535b7adc9c1","closed","","siccovansas","2018-08-13T12:44:53Z","2018-09-26T23:15:14Z"

Now, choose `None`, then click OK. - Go back to the main `Settings` page, and then go to `Notifications` again.  **Actual result:** The setting is changed back to the previous (Default/custom) selection. **Expected result:** The `None` setting should persist.  ### Device info  **Device:** LeEco Le 2 **Android version:** 8.1 (LineageOS 15.1) **Signal version:** 4.25.10","closed","","astatine","2018-09-16T11:44:58Z","2018-09-17T05:30:34Z"

I have searched for other issues and found them related to external storage, however my phone has no removable storage. Tapping ""Create backup"" causes my conversation history in all conversations to disappear and my phone cannot send or receive any messages until Signal is killed or my phone is restarted.  I'm not really a technical user at all and didn't understand if this is the same as #7802. If so, feel free to close this issue.   ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal and navigate to Settings -> Chats and media - Tap ""Create backup""   **Actual result:**  - A progress bar will appear with the text ""0 messages so far"". Tap back button to return to conversation list. - Tap into any conversation listed. It will be empty. - Going back into Chats and media settings will show ""Last backup: never"" and the progress bar will be gone.  **Expected result:**  Backup would work and not freeze Signal  ### Device info **Device:** Google Nexus 5x **Android version:** 8.1 (LineageOS 15.1) **Signal version:** 4.19.3","closed","","eb053049","2018-05-17T21:18:31Z","2018-06-20T16:56:29Z"

Under the ""How do I move messages to my new phone?"" section, step 2 says to transfer the ""Signal"" folder from your old phone to your new phone (along with a disclaimer that the process varies by phone/OS). On the Nexus 5x running Android 8.1.0, the Signal folder is not visible from Windows Explorer, even when specifying that hidden items should be shown. The signal folder _is_ visible from the Android file system explorer, including all backups contained therein. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/89uenb/signalbackup_folder_hidden_from_android_usb/) reddit thread indicates other users have encountered this issue.  Workaround: On your Nexus 5x, go to Settings > Storage > Files and open the Signal directory. Move or copy your Signal backups to the Downloads folder. Connect your Nexus 5x to your computer, and then copy the Signal backup from the Nexus 5x downloads folder to your own computer in preparation for transfer to your new phone. Note that the Signal backup files might show up as 0 KB in size from Windows Explorer; disconnecting then reconnecting my phone to my computer fixed this issue, and the Signal backup files were sized as expected.  ### Steps to reproduce - Create backup from Signal Settings > Chats and Media > Chat backups on your Nexus 5x Android device - Connect your Nexus 5x to a Windows computer via USB - On your Nexus 5x, use the USB connection alert to enable file transfer between your computer and device - Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the root ""Internal shared storage"" directory; note absence of Signal directory - On your Nexus 5x, go to Settings > Storage > Files and note the presence of the Signal directory (and backup(s) therein)  **Actual result:** Signal directory is not visible from Windows explorer, hindering attempts to backup/restore Signal messages on another phone. **Expected result:** Signal directory is visible from Windows explorer, enabling easy copying of Signal directory onto your computer and then onward to your new phone.  ### Screenshots  ![Windows Explorer view (note Hidden items is checked)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/718765/39603858-bf6a7c7e-4ede-11e8-8e45-840cee550af9.png)  ![Android file explorer view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/718765/39603943-03f37dc8-4edf-11e8-88f5-7f0eec660678.png)  ### Device info **Device:** LG Nexus 5x 32 GB **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.18.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/9ac618bbe6bdf40c02e730a3d6c4c8f25b377bc2a109af36a548d797fc32c2ba","closed","","ahelwer","2018-05-03T21:51:03Z","2019-07-20T04:04:48Z"

Sometimes get prompted to input the six-digit-code by signalapp, sometimes do not get that far in signalapp UI/UX.   * To eliminate possibility it was the network being flaky, attempted from multiple locations (in two countries even).   *  To eliminate the possibility of rate-limiting being the problem, waited a few hours and then tried again Friday 2018-08-24, then waited a few days before trying again Wednesday 2018-08-29 between 8:20pm and 8:23pm localtime in Belgium, with latest attempt resulting in the generic ""unable to connect to service"" error message.   *  To eliminate the possibility that it was Something Else, tried registering a different telephone number (from burner phone) which DID succeed correctly.  So it seems to be a problem specific to this +32.xxx.xxx.xxx telephone number, albeit it was working before.   *  Did not setup the registration-lock-PIN feature (previously when signal functioned).   *  Fresh install of signal with no attempt to retain past conversation-history. *  Handset is linked to the associated google-account.   *  Was not using signalapp-beta (previously nor currently) on this handset.   **Expected result:** Should not get ""unable to connect"" error message, should receive SMS conf-code, should make it all the way through the steps, registration should succeed properly.    ### Screenshots  n/a... might be able to provide them if really necessary   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S9+ (Model SM-965F)  **Android version:** 8.0 stock ROM with Samsung Experience v9.0 and Android security patch level 1st August 2018 (latest available for handset)  **Signal version:** 4.24.8  ### Link to debug log  n/a because the handset cannot register with signal-server ... MIGHT be able to try the adb logcat thing if REALLY necessary?  ### Additional potentially-relevant info  * Forum thread with all the gory details:   https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/blacklist-of-signal/3915   *  There should also be some email(s) which was/were sent to support@signal.org   From searching, these issue-reports might be relevant:   *  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7980 == Unable to register: verification code not received, however sms&robocall arrived 90 minutes later for india OP, commenter#2 never received sms&robocall, commenter#3 gets unable-to-connect, commenter#4 in Tanzania has mixture of unable-to-connect plus never getting sms&robocall on 4.24.8 latest-stable  * https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7819 == App doesn't report 413 [you-are-rate-limited] errors correctly ... can somebody review the pull request over there please?   *  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6237#issuecomment-301343886  ==  ""unable to connect"" after factory reset && playSvcs update, workaround was to uninstall playSvcs, register signal, reinstall playSvcs... but that left the playSvcs in a broken state  *  https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5864 == Signal was ""unable to connect"" to the server.

Send MMS  **Actual result:** MMS (picture) is sent successfully but compressed to a really low resolution, therefore making the image not very pleasant to view. **Expected result:** MMS (picture) should be sent so it can been seen clearly.  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus 2 **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.24.2  ### Other information I see that the following files have been amended in the past to assist those who also raised this issue. src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/BitmapUtil.java src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/mms/PushMediaConstraints.java  Also read that this issue is potentially due to the amount of RAM on the device. Not sure if I've misunderstood that.  ### Question Is there anything I can do (in terms of amending the above code in those files) so that when I send a picture message the resolution is higher? My carrier supports MMS up to 2mb (tested with another Messaging app).","closed","","ghost","2018-07-23T11:32:44Z","2018-07-23T19:13:57Z"

Most importantly, there is no ""end call"" button anymore. Sometimes the layout gets restored correctly after e.g. entering the homescreen and getting back to the call screen again. Unfortunately, I am note able to reproduce this issue on purpose, but it happened about 10 times during the last months.  ### Steps to reproduce - Do a regular signal call (phone to ear; no speaker, no video) - After some time, look at the phone - Most of the times, everything is ok, but sometimes it isn't.  **Actual result:** Broken layout, i.e. no contact name, no phone number, most importantly no ""end call"" button. The contact image is still shown (black area in screenshot), but with some white surrounding area. **Expected result:** Correct call screen layout.  ### Screenshots ![broken_layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23025712/44633850-4f1df100-a945-11e8-89b3-42417709955a.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** 7.0 **Signal version:** 4.25.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/ea6c66cd958e645e74e7ed782fd14a894c1afe5ca7fad21e004402afe55a69ed","closed","ux,","minnmann","2018-08-26T22:39:24Z","2020-06-02T09:14:07Z"

I am a longtime Signal user (around 3 years) and have never had battery drain issues like this. Even with minimal Signal use, it is listed as the app that drains the most battery every day. Nothing on my phone changed other than Signal updating.  ### Steps to reproduce - Can't really say how to reproduce it. This started happening as soon as I updated to 4.25.10. - I did try disabling Signal as my default SMS app just to see if it helped somehow, but it's still the same.  - I have also restarted my phone and cleared out lots of old messages just to see if it somehow helped.  - This does not appear to be related to #7839 which is not only fixed already, but also I'm not having any issues with performance. But I did switch to system emoji to test and it didn't help any.  **Actual result:** Even with very low usage, Signal drains more battery than every other app on my phone.   **Expected result:** Battery drain should be minimal.  ### Screenshots ![Battery stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16511903/45900608-425ab480-bdae-11e8-8c9d-2f4786cc544d.png)  ![Signal battery details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16511903/45900623-4981c280-bdae-11e8-9463-6197b5ea7fde.png)  ### Device info **Device:** LG V35 Thinq (AT&T)   **Android version:** 8.0.0.

When opening Signal and clicking the pencil/pen and then seeing the Contacts, Signal users are placed at the top of Contacts, breaking ```Alphabetical Order```  I'm calling this a Bug, which I'm assuming this is the way it's designed, but this is really a flawed idea, for people that have a lot of contacts, and then get them shuffled like this. I really hate this, and with a lot of contacts this is going to be crazy looking at the contacts like this.  PLEASE figure something else out so that the ```Alphabetical Order``` is not messed with. Please don't even add blue color fonts, or bold fonts, because I also noticed the name was now in bold color. Maybe a ```lock icon``` can be added somewhere in the contacts is all?  ```Please don't take me the wrong way, I truly appreciate all the work everyone is doing on such a great app, but this really needs to change, I can't stand this. I understand this is only seen like this inside Signal, that the actual Contacts app is not changed, but it would be great if the contacts were still left looking orignal in Signal.```  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Click pencil/pen - Now you'll see Signal users at the top of the Contacts list.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Contacts are not in ```Alphabetical Order```.

This is really frustrating needing to register Signal with Google, which I thought needing the Google Play Services to register was done away with?  I don't use Gapps on the phone, my custom rom is almost all stripped of Google, I use F-Droid instead.  Can Open Whisper please kill off this Google dependancy for registration.  Using custom roms with microg, I have noticed you can't register if you have FakeStore installed, you need to remove it, at least running the ```Stable``` versions of microg.  I have noticed if I use the latest Preview versions of microg, and I add a Google/Gmail account to the device, I can register ok, maybe the account works ok on the stable version of microg, I didn't test it.  I don't want a Gmail account, and it seems like the only way around this I have found out, unless you uninstall FakeStore. End-Users shouldn't be forced into needing a Google/Gmail account to register Signal when running custom roms and microg.  ### Steps to reproduce - Installed custom rom - Installed microg - Installed Xposed - Installed FakeGapps - Everything checked in microG except ```Location Backends & Network-based location```  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  If I try to register it asks me to update Google Play Services.  ### Screenshots   ![signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36190223/43989042-1b91ecd4-9d32-11e8-9f20-19801d0c27cd.jpg)  This is a screen shot now showing a message with FakeStore uninstalled.  ![fakestore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36190223/43989204-c3a60b38-9d34-11e8-80bd-b7f57ac4ffbf.jpg)   Now the issue also becomes, will there be ```reliability``` and ```performance``` issues?   ### Device info  **Device:** Xiaomi Mi A1 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** Signal-website-release-4.24.8 **Services Core - com.google.android.gms-9258259.apk ** Services Framework Proxy - com.google.android.gsf-8.apk ** Store (FakeStore release) - com.android.vending-16.apk ** DroidGuard Helper - org.microg.gms.droidguard-4.apk - stable  ### Link to debug log","closed","","0pLuS0","2018-08-11T07:02:02Z","2018-08-11T23:17:14Z"

We want to help you using Signal and we have created our support system just for that. You can reach support by sending email to support@whispersystems.org""), I've received no reply nor even an automated acknowledgment of my message.  In my opinion, discarding previous functionality during version transitions from 4.15.5 to 4.18.3 where that functionality was purportedly available before (but was actually broken) is a bug, not a feature request or a support request, but I know there may be differing opinions on this.","closed","","ghost","2018-05-04T16:03:56Z","2018-05-08T12:59:19Z"

Calls worked well up until I upgraded to 4.24.8 today. Not sure exactly which version I was running before, but based on the repo's release history it was likely 4.24.{0-2}.  When the crash happens, examining the chat history for that contact afterwards says ""You called"" for each attempt that crashed, however the contact never saw the missed call. When my contact calls me, Signal crashes, and when I open Signal again afterwards it says ""Missed call"".  Text messages back and forth over the Signal protocol work just fine.  My contact is running an older version of the Signal app on Android (not sure which exactly), however my expectation is that an older app version shouldn't crash my newer one. The contact is unable to upgrade to the latest version due to low free space.  I also tried calling a contact who is known to have their phone offline, and that crashed similarly.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open or create a conversation with a Signal contact - Click the call button - Window displays ""Signal call +"" with ""Dialing""   **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  - Call window crashes after a few seconds and displays ""Unfortunately, Signal has stopped."" - Conversation window displays behind the ""Unfortunately, Signal has stopped"" alert and returns after I click ""ok""  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  - Wonderful, private conversation  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola XT1528 **Android version:** 5.1 **Signal version:** 4.24.8  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/5286de5a56a51e900d0e6e45a44f0b7c409dddbdccf75528edd2ebb5ecaa3859","closed","wontfix,","pshephard","2018-08-09T00:54:25Z","2022-02-04T14:14:14Z"

I remember that for a fraction of a second, ""Updating database"" was shown before I saw that empty list.  When nothing was shown for a while, I asked a friend to send me a message on Signal. Upon returning to the phone, the conversation list was fully populated again. I don't know if the received message triggered this, or if just waiting for a while would have also done the trick. Perhaps a background operation was still running before it could be shown?  ### Steps to reproduce I cannot reproduce this since I already updated, and after receiving a single message, the conversations were shown again. But it happened directly after the update.  **Actual result:** After the update from 4.17.5, the conversation list was empty for a while, presumably until the first Signal message was received from a contact **Expected result:** After the update, when the conversation list shows up it should not be empty, but should be populated like before the update.  ### Device info **Device:** Oneplus 3 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 2.18.1  ### Link to debug log From immediately after the update when conversation list was empty: https://debuglogs.org/c23ca4f42f7cc34ae069d223c07ff3ae6859ddf6131e3cb80e6d15d8ca6929bf From a few minutes after the conversations were shown again: https://debuglogs.org/2acf6dad2bdb690f60cf28fb0be00d104dc9635289d8feb5c586ff04410914bf","closed","","Natanji","2018-04-05T12:38:48Z","2018-04-05T12:57:54Z"

To my dismay I had to discover that this message was not only delivered to these fine individuals, but also to an entirely different group which I converse with. The overlap of these two groups is included twice in the delivery receipts. This caused an ""Unnamed Group"" and the message in question to appear for the users which are not in the intended group.

Additionally now we have both groups messed up and receiving an alarming number of disappearing messages timer upgrades from users of the unintended group. This might be a separate issue I will raise with the Signal-Desktop repository.   ### Steps to reproduce - Restore (a rather large >160000Messages, >4GB) Backup - Send Message to a group  **Actual result:** Message received by multiple groups **Expected result:** Message received in a single group only  ### Screenshots ![screenshot_20180619-160359](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17763262/41610409-6bb42fa6-73ed-11e8-8afd-02a8b5565766.png) The intended group with the offending message and the disappearing message timer from non-members.  ![signal-2018-06-18-224938](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17763262/41610439-80b3eaea-73ed-11e8-9ede-d05d885d9432.png) The unnamed group on the phone of one unintended recipient  ![screenshot_20180619-002611](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17763262/41610676-1de3b912-73ee-11e8-8fd4-1e3d00f3c26f.png) Message self-identifying as send to a larger than intended group of people  ![screenshot_20180619-002633](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17763262/41610739-459fc36a-73ee-11e8-9075-0750f43c7224.png) After a group update with the intended set of people  ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G6+ **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.20.8  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/7c27e3f93e79c6bb41d1bc71feb1225105e941de8dba6f8296f18ddaad2497ac","closed","","fsck","2018-06-19T16:51:38Z","2018-06-22T05:35:55Z"

Instead Signal shows the usual colored circle with the respective contact's initials in these cases. (Still holds 25 minutes after the install and after texting with one such contact.)  (As a side note: The app does show pictures which I set myself in the phone's contacts app. But there's no intersection betw the two sets of contacts.)  _Edited for clarity after @p4nci 's comment below._  ### Steps to reproduce - install Signal, don't import a backup  **Actual result:** Signal doesn't depict contacts' avatars which they set themselves. Instead it shows the regular colored circles with initials. **Expected result:** After a reasonable amount of time, self-set pictures should be shown.  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G4 Play **Android version:** 7.1.2 (LineageOS) **Signal version:** 4.18.3  ### Link to debug log [Here's one](https://debuglogs.org/f3164394c8d1df602e41521f4a71698986f101772327b008b404778cb2926df0), taken two minutes after installing the app.","closed","","AlfonsoMuskedunder","2018-04-16T11:49:32Z","2018-04-16T19:18:24Z"

"","7606","Easy mixup of personal and group conversations leaks sensitive information to wrong people","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description  There is a common _usability bug_ of Signal. Lets say you are getting a Signal message on your mobile. You select the notification message, switching to your Signal app, opening the conversation. You now see the last part of the conversation dialogue between you and this single person. You now answer the message of that person, writing things that are meant to be read only by that single person. Just after sending the message (or never?) you realize that you just sent this message to a group chat of many people whose conversation happens to be filled with messages of you and the other person as long as your screen view/history is showing.  Therefore, you accidentally sent a personal message to a group conversation which is a common bug I notice many times.  You assumed, that you wrote your message in a private conversation because you have seen only one person's answers. Other people did not write for a longer period of time to that group conversation. You could have read the header information where you could have seen that this is not a person-to-person conversation. However, you concentrate on the bottom of the screen, where the received message could be seen and answer right below it. Therefore, it is easy to overlook the group chat header when answering a message in Signal. There is no other distinction between group and personal conversations.  (This bug was issues before as https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7158 and got closed due to spring cleaning and a changed template)  ### Steps to reproduce  The situation in a private chat:  - switch to a person-to-person conversation with person X - you see the most recent chat messages of X and yourself - you can answer right away and the message get sent to X  Now the situation in a group chat:  - now switch to a group conversation where X is part of as well - the most recent messages are only from you and X - it is easy to assume that this is a private chat between you and X: you only see messages from X and yourself, the lower part of the screen looks the same in group chats and in private chats:   - input field   - default text hint   - send button   - style - As a result, private text messages get sent to a group chat  **Actual result:** Private message get sent to a group of people. **Expected result:** User should have recognized that the message is about to be sent to a group of people and not to a private chat.  For a messaging app that emphasizes the importance of privacy, sending sensitive private information to a group of people by accident is considered an important issue IMO. Since there are easy to implement technical solutions to prevent this (see below), this is considered a bug and not a feature request.  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 5 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.17.5  ### Possible mitigations  There are multiple possible ways to fix this issue. A distinct background color is one which seemed to be a low-hanging fruit in terms of quick-fix because this features exists in the personal conversation settings and not in the group conversation settings for no obvious reason. However, there is still the issue that Signal might give away ""red"" for an arbitrary personal conversation but this only leads to you looking more closely to the header, realizing that it is save to write personal stuff in this conversation.  Changing the ""Signal message"" default text of the input line would be another possibility although in my opinion, this is too subtle. I don't think that users do read this default text any more. Things like that is likely to be ignored just like banner ads are being ignored easily despite their prominent use of color or animation.  I do think that changing the send-button to something like a send button that graphically includes multiple smaller send buttons or multiple of those paper-plane-symbols would be a very good distinction.

AOSP's built-in Messaging app clearly and promptly notifies the user that the SMS couldn't be sent, but Signal claims that the message was sent even though it's actually gone to a black hole.  Per the philosophy that [there are no power users](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-ideology), I am reporting this because it is likely to confuse new users. Many users, I suspect, will expect that Signal can send SMS messages via some over-the-top IP-based method (like Google Voice, TextNow, etc.) and will get the wrong impression from attempting to use it to send an SMS from a device where that isn't possible.","closed","","dlenski","2018-04-27T01:07:14Z","2018-04-29T22:29:17Z"

However, I chose a PIN which is registered in my password manager, and it looks like the PIN entry is not compatible with autofill : although my password manager (keepass2android) finds the entry, it does not autocomplete it like it does in other applications.

This can cause problems especially if there is a crash in the handling causing the state to not be properly synced.   The native protocol library does have a decrypt that supports a callback https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/7d94f31a99ab265b083d6179d02029517f0d8069/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/SessionCipher.java#L174 but https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-service-java/blob/master/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/crypto/SignalServiceCipher.java does not use it. The local state can be updated, then a crash before the server notified will cause a 'replay' event to potentially occur and the client to see it as out of sequence.   This was detected in the 3rd party library copy that had the same bug and discussed at https://github.com/signal-csharp/libsignal-service-dotnet/issues/18   Interestingly the server behavior between 2.5 and 2.7 seemed to have changed.  In 2.5 a crash during the decrypt callback would result in the data being replayed to the client during the next connect to the server.  In 2.7 even though the clients state has not been updated the server does not replay the missed message but the next message goes through fine.  The other message is dropped without issue.","closed","wontfix,","mitchcapper","2018-05-29T08:23:19Z","2022-02-04T17:16:45Z"

Frequently I will need to recall some information from a week or months in the past, and in active threads (especially group chats) this basically leads to me giving up and asking the information again.

As OSS is usually developed by volunteers the contributors mostly only have time to process messages on the weekend. Also as weekends are for recreation, they won't want to contribute each one of them.  This means that the current maximal disappearing message delay of 1 week is very stressful when using Signal as a developer chat tool.  I would propose adding 1 month and 3 months as delay options.  **Notice before closing**: I do fully admit that this is a usecase which does not affect the average human.   However Signal being open source itself means that this issue may affect its own developers. And if a software isn't suitable for being used by its own developers then something is wrong :)","closed","","leo-bogert","2018-08-10T21:33:09Z","2018-08-13T18:30:13Z"

I know this is a cosmetic issue, but important for an app that is used as much as Signal.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Smart Launcher 5 (or other launchers that supports adaptive icons).  - Use the adaptive icons in Smart Launcher. **Actual result:** The icon will appear as a mostly white icon without any resemblance to the Signal icon. **Expected result:** The icon should appear as an adapted Signal icon clearly identifiable. The problem is confirmed by the Smart Launcher developers. All other app icons I use adapts well. Signal is the only one that doesn't work well in this regard.  ### Screenshots ![img_20180331_225114](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1281031/38269601-fb384a30-374e-11e8-8dea-31db9db4b9c1.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Moto G5+ **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.18.0","closed","","cdysthe","2018-04-03T18:59:24Z","2018-04-04T07:55:54Z"

However in the last few months, when I call another signal user, they don't hear the call ring and only get a missed call notification  1) This is happening with users in the US, where there was no issue previously. Since it is in the US, it is not a firewall issue 2) On both ends, the app has permissions to mic and camera 3) There is a super-strong wifi connection on both ends and whatsapp, Skype and wire calls ring and connect effortlessly  This is now happening with 100% of calls being placed with signal, effectively making signal useless to make voice calls. Can you please look into this and fix it urgently  Thanks  ### Steps to reproduce Am able to reproduce this 100% of the times now. Earlier would happen 50% of the time  - This is not related to clock syncing. Both devices have the exact same time and all other calling apps such as Wire, WhatsApp and Skype work perfectly     **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 2 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.29.5  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","Maximus778","2018-10-24T20:20:01Z","2022-05-15T07:36:56Z"

My phone shows immediately a missed call.  ps1.I can call other people without problem ps2.

And its different from this https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7090 since it shows the missed call immediately when the caller calls you. Doesnt wait for the caller to end it. ps4.I updated through app store signal and it shows me 4.23.4. It doesnt show me the update to 4.24.7 while the latest version and the version of the caller is 4.24.7.   ### Steps to reproduce - Somebody calls me. - The caller keep hearing the dialing tone and i get a missed called  **Actual result:** The caller is stuck hearing the dialing sound and nothing happens.

I am on Android. Recipients get a missed call even if I'm still trying to connect. And I get no missed calls.  ### Steps to reproduce - call contact with iPhone - it just stays trying to connect on sonar sound never rings - we can text and picture message - they get a missed call appear even while I'm still trying to connect - if they call me I get nothing, no missed calls appear on my screen,  - I've only once been able to make a contacts phone ring ( past the sonar sound stage of trying to connect and they are on Android) - have a Huawei p20 pro to recreate ( or don't , bloody intrusive version of Android probably causing these symptoms)  **Actual result:** result is I can't call most of my contacts with signal and they can't call me **Expected result:** I should be able to make and receive signal calls to other contacts when we both have internet connection  I have tried the suggested solutions on other threads here, this is not a network issue it happens on WiFi or 4g connection so the API access point solution  ( ipv4)doesn't work, I've changed the battery saving settings etc on the Huawei as recommend ed in the trouble shooting section,  Any help would be very much appreciated as I was using signal very happily up until 2 weeks ago when I got this annoying phone. I think there may be a compatibility issue with these Huawei phones and signal that has gone hitherto unnoticed. Thanks in advance for any help and time spent.  I've included the log that includes the only time I've managed to make another signal phone ring since I've had this phone so hopefully someone much smarter than me could be able to tell what should be happening with that call to Android Vs what is happening to iPhones. The iPhone called in the log is updated to latest version of signal available on iTunes.  ### Screenshots   ### Device info **Device:** Huawei p20 pro clt-l09 c782 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.24.8  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/db8f8c712424574275af3631122d3b3c523790c4704ff5743f8318dc2d364a79","closed","calling,","frystratedbob","2018-09-01T15:43:31Z","2018-09-17T04:20:52Z"

I have no explanation as to why this might have happened, as other MMS image messages received from the same numbers at other times were placed into the correct conversation threads.  ### Steps to reproduce Unfortunately, this issue is not reliably reproducible to my knowledge. The issue was observed when receiving MMS messages (images) from two separate numbers; however, other MMS messages from the same numbers at other times were placed in the correct conversation thread.  ### Screenshots ![signalwrongconvthreadmms_05-31-2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1057406/40813947-738c7ca6-650b-11e8-942c-cb8fb3a6abec.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Huawei Nexus 6P **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** 4.19.3, installed from Google Play  ### Link to debug log The following log shows opening Signal and then opening the '1' conversation thread. https://debuglogs.org/a12112e255e77c670f1ba655e31089a86c675fa39a30aff004ffbdcf4f62b16b","closed","wontfix,","jsoberg","2018-05-31T23:55:19Z","2022-04-10T16:45:00Z"

I had initially seen it as a venus symbol and it led to a very tense situation of me thinking this salesperson was being misogynistic to my lender or me (both women) because faxes are unreliable.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send the text displayed in the screenshotted screenshot from an iPhone to an Android phone with signal. - View the text from the Pixel to see that the facepalm emoji gets expanded to facepalm + mars-symbol.  **Expected result:** The message in signal should only display a facepalm, not a facepalm + mars-symbol  I don't have the hardware to try to reproduce this myself. I can only show an instance of it happening with my screenshot.  Weirder, I copied the text of his message with facepalm + mars-symbol and sent it back to him, and his chat app still just showed facepalm.  ### Screenshots https://github.com/deeglaze/bug-report-assets/blob/default/signal_emoji_screenshot.png?raw=true  Please forgive the incorrect reading of the mars symbol as ""female emoji"".

There is no option to import encrypted backups once Signal is registered. The currently existing restore process is broken, See #7637. An option to restore encrypted backups should exist after registering if Signal fails to prompt for a passphrase to restore messages. I consider this a bug because there is no other method of restoring encrypted backups in the current version of Signal.   Backup Signal messages on device (Metro LG Stylo 2 in my case) after removing SD card. (removal necessary to due another existing bug.) Reinstall SD Card.  Copy backup to SD Card Remove SD Card Install SD card on new device. (For me, Sprint LG G6) Copy or Move backup from SD card into System folder directly as expected in previous versions of Signal Install Signal from Google Play Store Open Signal Expect passphrase to appear (none does) per [instructions](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/212535818-What-do-I-do-if-I-have-a-new-phone-or-change-my-number-) Complete Registration Open Import  See that encrypted backups can't be restored but plain text can.  **Actual result:** No option exists after registering to import encrypted backups without generating a new passphrase **Expected result:** Have an option to import encrypted backups after registering  **Device:** LG Stylo 2 to LG G6 **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.19.3 (Both phones)  ### Link to debug log No debug log because no information to pass into debug log as option is unavailable","closed","","WSLUser","2018-05-03T13:49:21Z","2018-06-27T17:55:30Z"

My Signal shows no sign that I'm being called. At the end of ringing, when the network automatically disconnects, I immediately receive a ""You have a missed call"" notification in the chat.  Reproduced on three different WiFi networks with the same person.  The time difference between the two phones is approximately 5 seconds. Both phones are set to synch to carrier time.  ### Steps to reproduce  - Make phone A call phone B in Signal - Observe that phone B gets no notification about the incoming call just the missed one.  **Actual result:** Call arrives as missed one. **Expected result:** Phone B rings.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  Device: Sony F5121 Android version: 7.1.1 Signal version: 4.14.10  ### Link to debug log Callee debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9984ab543d85a181b06b02954564c060 Caller debug log: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5eae662fee114e5e07a72dbd02c0e92d  Original report: #7314  @moxie0: > According to the logs in the issue, the devices are not able to find a valid ICE candidate.

"","7419","playback of audio attachments behaves like active phone call","### Problematic functionality When playing an audio attachment within Signal, if the proximity sensor is triggered then the screen shuts off and audio is played from the earpiece. If the screen is turned off during playback, playback stops. If this is intended functionality, I don't understand why this would be desired. I know of no other applications that behave in this way, save for with active phone calls.  This is related to this issue, but goes further: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6993  Example scenario 1: - A user starts playback of an audio attachment. - Said user continues to read messages in that conversation while the audio plays. - While scrolling, one of their fingers (or any other random object) happens to briefly move near the proximity sensor. - The screen turns off and then immediately back on, and playback has stopped. - For a user who isn't expecting this behaviour or doesn't know enough about proximity sensors to predict how they will function, they try to play the audio again, only to have the above scenario play out again. This repeats 3-4 times, after which they swear loudly, give up in frustration, and start harassing me for encouraging them to use Signal in the first place instead of a ""real"" app that ""works for normal people"".  Example scenario 2: - My phone's speaker is on the back of the device. - The audio attachment is long, and I don't want to be holding my phone or have the screen on (to conserve battery) that whole time. - I want to turn off the screen, put my phone down on a table (screen facing down, speaker facing up) and do something else while I listen to the message. This is currently impossible unless I download the audio file and play it using a different app. - Even if I leave the phone facing upward, the screen will automatically shut off after 30 seconds, stopping the playback.  ### Device info Many devices (all?), but my particular device information is: **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S4 (SHV-E330S) **Android version:** 5.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.15.5","closed","","dcorks","2018-02-16T04:19:12Z","2018-02-17T04:57:20Z"

This change adds the functionality to export and import a password-based-encrypted full backup of your Signal app-data. The user can choose a password for this encrypted backup.  This will fix many open issues (like #7097, #7144 and #1619) and resolve the discusson on https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/encrypted-backup/1227/39 !  Limitation: The functionality for importing a backup is limited to a clean app, right after the installation you can choose import instead of registration.  The company I work for (bevuta IT GmbH) gave me the task to code this. If you have any questions regarding the code or want it to be changed in some way, let me know, so I can implement/change it the way you want.

Rationale of this change is, that copying media messages does not work (but forwarding does). - Since there is enough space left on the toolbar: make the forward icon always visible.

However, after leaving a group, the inactive group still appears in the filtered contact list search results that appear when attempting to compose a new message. This is confusing to a number of fellow users that I have interacted with via groups. Once a group is left, a user must have another user of the group re-add them before the user that left the group can again send a message to the group. Thus the most intuitive action is to filter the results from possible contacts for new message compositions. That is what this PR does.  This effectively allows ""deleting"" a group (from the user's high-level perspective) by first leaving it, and then deleting all threads associated with the left group. The user will not see inactive groups while attempting to create new messages, unless re-invited (due to some ""recents"" processing, the inactive group still hangs around for sharing/invite actions, but these are out of scope for what I am interested in).  Technical note: The reason why I made the change like this is because when I originally made the change like the following diff, the conversation search (aka thread search filter) stopped working as I expected it too (basically that filter would not match existing threads/conversations). The reason is because `ContactAccessor.getNumbersForThreadSearchFilter` depends on `GroupDatabase.getGroupsFilteredByTitle` too.  ``` diff --git a/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/GroupDatabase.java b/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/GroupDatabase.java index 490d3ee0..ad7fcca8 100644 --- a/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/GroupDatabase.java +++ b/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/GroupDatabase.java @@ -105,8 +105,8 @@ public class GroupDatabase extends Database {      public Reader getGroupsFilteredByTitle(String constraint) {      @SuppressLint(""Recycle"") -    Cursor cursor = databaseHelper.getReadableDatabase().query(TABLE_NAME, null, TITLE + "" LIKE ?"", -                                                                                        new String[]{""%"" + constraint + ""%""}, +    Cursor cursor = databaseHelper.getReadableDatabase().query(TABLE_NAME, null, TITLE + "" LIKE ?

This is a highly requested feature (see #6279 and its many duplicates). I took the time to implement it for my mother and my friends; until now we had a bad time when trying to show things to each other with Signal, because ""turning the phone around"" to film with the front camera means you can no longer see what you're filming.  I have tested it between my Moto X devices, seems to work quite well.  There are two possible improvements that I would like to discuss; the feature works fine without them but it would be nice to figure out if there's a better way:  * The video preview (on the sender's side) his horizontally flipped when using the back camera. This is a minor UX annoyance. Please let me know how I can flip it. It's the right way around on the receiver's side. * In `PeerConnectionWrapper.java` I create an additional `VideoCapturer`, `VideoSource` and `VideoTrack` for the rear camera, in addition to the corresponding triple of those for the front camera. This is because I am not sure whether I can swap the underlying hardware device of a `VideoCapturer` at runtime, in which case one triple might be sufficient. Note that, as expected, only one triple is recording at any given time.","closed","","nh2","2018-03-23T21:22:53Z","2018-07-17T16:14:35Z"

If such a shortcut is clicked then instead of opening the list view of the app, it jumps straight to the conversation view.  I suggested this feature in the forum here: https://community.signalusers.org/t/contacts-widget-shortcut/2352  This PR implements this. Generally the code is straightforward with one slightly more complicated part: the recipient cannot be placed as a `Parcelable` onto the home screen as the class `Address` is unknown. For this reason it is serialised as a string. The view initialisation code then checks if the `Parcelable` can be found. If it can't it will read it as a string.  I have tested this with the emulator on a Nexus 5X (Android 7.1.2) and deployed the apk to my real Motorola Moto G3 (Android 6.0.1).  I made a recording of the the feature in action: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RXHLtatl7cESKPZ06xdUCau8UJhw-9K9","closed","","leonardehrenfried","2018-07-29T13:18:30Z","2018-08-02T07:26:44Z"

The circular icon was always being used if the device defined support for it. Additionally, the PNG launcher icons are not appropriately sized for Adaptive Icons.  To remedy this, a new alias is introduced so that on API 26, the Adaptive Icon file is used to render the launcher icon, regardless of what the device defines. This is as prescribed by Google Developer Advocate Ian Lake https://medium.com/@ianhlake/vectordrawable-adaptive-icons-3fed3d3205b5#3a57  A new vector drawable is introduced as the foreground layer of the Adaptive Icon. The source for this drawable is https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Design/blob/61c5342a0bd1184eaded49685a0cfcf5ec8882d4/android/icons/app_icon/android_material.eps  `colors.xml` was using a different hue of the primary blue than the eps file, so it has been updated with the eps file hue.  Testing was performed using the [AdaptiveIconPlayground](https://github.com/nickbutcher/AdaptiveIconPlayground/releases). The following are examples of how the icon renders.","closed","","MariusVolkhart","2018-04-22T05:29:24Z","2018-06-06T17:10:24Z"

Please ensure that you explicitly call close() on your cursor: INSERT INTO sms (address, person, date_sent, date, protocol, read, status, type, reply_path_present,     net.sqlcipher.database.DatabaseObjectNotClosedException: Application did not close the cursor or database object that was opened here         at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteCompiledSql.(SQLiteCompiledSql.java:62)         at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteProgram.(SQLiteProgram.java:109)         at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteStatement.(SQLiteStatement.java:39)         at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteDatabase.compileStatement(SQLiteDatabase.java:1647)         at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.SmsDatabase.createInsertStatement(SmsDatabase.java:767)         at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.SmsMigrator.migrateConversation(SmsMigrator.java:166)         at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.database.SmsMigrator.migrateDatabase(SmsMigrator.java:210)         at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.service.ApplicationMigrationService$ImportRunnable.run(ApplicationMigrationService.java:159)         at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1162)         at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:636)         at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:764) ```  We aren't closing Statement objects before the finalizer on those objects runs. When the GC runs, we'll get warnings like the above which alert us to the fact that these objects are being automatically closed for us in the finalizer, but that this is suboptimal behavior.  If we leave too many Statement (or Cursor) objects to be closed in their finalizers, when the GC runs, it'll take longer than 10 seconds to close them all and Android will kill the app. This 10 second limit is hardcoded and we can only try to avoid it. A crash will look like:  ``` java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteCompiledSql.finalize() timed out after 10 seconds     at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)     at java.lang.Thread.parkFor$(Thread.java:1220)     at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Unsafe.java:299)     at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:158)     at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.parkAndCheckInterrupt(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:810)     at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquireQueued(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:844)     at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1173)     at java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock$FairSync.lock(ReentrantLock.java:196)     at java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.lock(ReentrantLock.java:257)     at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteDatabase.lock(SQLiteDatabase.java:553)     at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteCompiledSql.releaseSqlStatement(SQLiteCompiledSql.java:106)     at net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteCompiledSql.finalize(SQLiteCompiledSql.java:152)     at java.lang.Daemons$FinalizerDaemon.doFinalize(Daemons.java:202)     at java.lang.Daemons$FinalizerDaemon.run(Daemons.java:185)     at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:818) ```  I was able to replicate the above crash consistently on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge when importing well over 100k SMS messages. But as soon as I attached a debugger the crash did not persist. I assume this is because of some VM-level interactions between the two and did not investigate further after fixing it.  I do not have access to the stack trace for issue #7953 but this could potentially resolve it. The crash is identical to that in #7477 but this patch is for SMS migration not restoring from a backup. I was not able to replicate the crash on restoring a >100k message backup.","closed","","kmark","2018-10-07T23:54:21Z","2019-04-17T13:56:01Z"

I have many (100+) contacts with whom I will only send or receive a 2-3 messages. It's not worth my time to add all of them to my contact list. Perhaps my use case is different from what the developers envisioned, but I don't think it's that uncommon.  **Actual result:** - I go to send a message to a particular phone number. I'm not sure if I've previously sent a message to that number or not. - I start typing in a phone number, and no autocomplete option appears. I am led to believe that I have not messaged that number before. - After typing in the full number, I start a conversation, and my previous messages to that phone number appear. - Aside from scrolling down a list of hundreds of conversations and manually reading the associated phone numbers, what I described above is the only way for me to see previous messages to/from that phone number.  Desired behaviour: - Ability to search all current and archived conversations based on contact name, contact phone number or conversation content. - Existing conversations to appear in new conversation search window based on phone number","closed","","dcorks","2018-02-16T03:54:28Z","2018-02-17T04:56:07Z"

However these conversions were being done as integer multiplication rather than long multiplication, meaning that there was a potential for overflows.  Specifically, the maximum value that could be represented before overflowing was `(2^31 / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24)` days = `24.8` days (< 1 month). Luckily the current allowed timeouts are all less than that value, but this fix would remove the artificial restriction, effectively allowing values of 1000x greater (68 years), at least for android.  Related: #5775  ----------  Full Disclosure: I initially found these problems [on lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/alerts/?mode=tree&severity=warning&rule=7900075), which is a product that I work on.

To call the former method I need access to the `OnPageChangeListener` of the `ViewPager`. The `ViewPager` class doesn't provide a method to access its `OnPageChangeListener`(s). So I decided to keep this listener in a local variable for a short time and so I am able to call `onPageSelected(0)`. Note that it is sufficient to attach the listener before the adapter is set. This condition is still satified after this PR.  ### Alternative considered approaches  We could also use a global variable to keep the listener. But I don't think this is necessary because it is only needed in the local scope you can see in the commit.  Alternatively extending `ViewPager` to be able to access the listeners at a later point is not easily possible because the listeners are kept in a private variable there. Also the diff would be much larger and not worth the effort imho.","closed","","FeuRenard","2018-02-03T22:45:34Z","2019-05-10T23:02:03Z"

But it is a small [duplication](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/ComposeText.java#L54) of code.  Commit 2 represents a IMHO nicer fix which makes the [`Util.isEmpty(...)`](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/util/Util.java#L129) use [`getTextTrimmed()`](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/components/ComposeText.java#L53) which `ConversationActivity` also uses before saving the draft text. It ensures that the same string is checked for emptiness which is later saved as draft. Therefore it's necessary to specialize `Util.isEmpty(EditText)` to `Util.isEmpty(ComposeText)`. This change is possible without problems because this method is only used in two places ([1](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/ConversationActivity.java#L1419),[2](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/ConversationActivity.java#L302) according to Android Studio) to check the content of `ComposeText`.  I also thought about a temporary variable like `String trimmedText` which is then checked for emptiness by [TextUtils.isEmpty(...)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/TextUtils.html#isEmpty(java.lang.CharSequence)). But there are some `null` checks in `Util.isEmpty(...)` which would be bypassed in this case.  In case you really want to keep the change as small as possible, just use the first commit and drop the second one. I tested both commits separately.","closed","","FeuRenard","2018-02-02T17:03:50Z","2018-03-16T21:52:32Z"

This address generally is your phone number for incoming media. But that's not what `MediaPreviewActivity` expects because it wants to use this address for loading the thread media.  I cannot imagine a case where `MediaGalleryAdapter`'s `address` is invalid AND passed to `MediaPreviewActivity`. If indeed an invalid address [was passed to `MediaGalleryAdapter`](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/MediaOverviewActivity.java#L201), the same address would be used to [load thread media for `MediaOverviewActivity`](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/MediaOverviewActivity.java#L219). In this hypothetic case we would have to fix the address retrieval in another place of the codebase.

There is button in the RemovableEditableMediaView component on the bottom left corner. I have done 2 commits, the first one is the code for the feature itself, the second one was to remove some useless imports and can be ignored. To crop the image it doesn't rely on any library because I did not want to make this commit too big; there already is a cropping library that is used to crop the profile image when the user chooses one, however such library is deprecated and no longer maintained. As such, the way I used to crop the image will only work if there is an app installed that provide such functionality (even the default gallery has this feature so this shouldn't be a problem, but I've noticed that on my huawei device it can cause problems), for this reason I suggest to import a new library that is still up to date and maintained and provide the cropping functionality (such as https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop or https://github.com/ArthurHub/Android-Image-Cropper) and to use it for both cropping the images on messages as well as the profile picture. On another note, both libraries I linked also provide a rotate functionality which will make adding the image rotation a lot easier.  This feature was mentioned in an old and now closed issue #6051 as well as on this forum thread https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/ability-to-edit-images-before-sharing-crop-rotate-flip-rebalance-draw-on/2446","closed","","aleb2000","2018-09-07T09:46:17Z","2018-09-29T14:50:51Z"

I propose to consider the time since the last registration lock PIN reminder for setting the next reminder interval instead of the last interval set.

I intentionally don't hide the navigation bar (immersive mode -> #5934) because this change would clash with the video controls. The video controls are then partly hidden behind the navigation bar and it's hard/hacky to detect the height of the navigation bar to correctly react to its size.

The patch works by intercepting paste events via `onTextContextMenuItem(int)` in `EmojiEditText` and taking one of the following steps depending on the version of android:  - If Android 6.0 or higher, simply set the paste event (`android.R.id.paste`) to be the newly added `android.R.id.pasteAsPlainText` - If < 6.0, the clipped text is sanitized of all formatting and then pasted into the clipboard. The paste proceeds, and after the text is inserted into the `EmojiEditText` the original unsanitized `ClipData` is returned to the clipboard.

This a bug because it is terrible UX.  ### Steps to reproduce - register phone A - register phone B - send ""hello world"" from B to A - uninstall Signal on B - wait N hours (really doesn't matter, but I bring it up because there should be a time based expiration or something) - send ""hello world"" from A to B  ### Desired result B should receive the message in cleartext.  ### Actual result No reply ""hello world"" is received on B.  ### Failed Solutions This issue has been discussed before (#7210 and #4678). The following replies are really insufficient answers: - Manually select SMS on every message   - The argument is that defaulting to secure is imperative, but this is onerous beyond being used once or twice - Guide your peer through [unregistering](https://whispersystems.org/textsecure/unregister/)   - This is a tall order  ### Purposed Solutions The previous suggestion was to default to the last message type used (e.g. sms), and while this would alleviate the pain of the immediate issue, it still leaves the question ""how do you know your peer no longer uses signal?"".  Instead, because this issue can also lead to false security, attempting to send someone sensitive or urgent messages only to have them sent to an unknown black hole, I suggest that signal spend time solving that remaining question, how can you identify if someone has removed themselves from the ecosystem, and gracefully degrade their account.","closed","","cornfeedhobo","2018-04-03T12:35:06Z","2018-04-03T17:54:32Z"

I get an entry in my NotificationBar then. If I open the NotificationBar (drag it down) and tap the new Signal message, Signal opens directly the new message. Now I read it and maybe answer it, then I tap the Back-Button to go back to my previous app. But now the Back-Button goes back in the Signal hierarchy up to the main Signal screen and another Back-Tap gets me to my home screen and not to my previous opened screen of my previous opened app. This app is maybe closed now by Android. This is often quite annoying, I would much prefer, that Signal behaves like e.g. WhatsApp or many other Apps in this context.  ### Device info **Device:** Cubot Note Plus **Android version:** 7.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.15.5  ### Further remarks  I have this unexpected behaviour also [in k9mail](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/963) and Threema. k9mail's developer says it is by intention, see [Navigation with Back and Up](https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html#into-your-app). But I think this is a misinterpretation of that design pattern, as there it is not described exact the same thing. It is described to navigate into your app, but not from one app into your app (through a notification from the NotificationBar). I would understand if the Back Button would at least in the end (in the main screen of Signal) lead to the previously opened app, where the user started, but this is not the case, Back goes to the Home Screen, closing just Signal, ignoring where the user was. This makes it not so nice to quickly open a notification through the NotificationBar if I am using another app. Only WhatsApp does this in my eyes correct and consistent.","closed","","francwalter","2018-01-26T13:06:04Z","2018-04-03T04:54:16Z"

"","7598","GitHub Issue Cleanup","## It's time for some spring cleaning As more people join the Signal team and our Android development efforts continue to accelerate, it is increasingly important to organize incoming issues. We rely on high-quality bug reports in order to triage, prioritize, diagnose, and fix the problems that users discover. We're excited about the enhancements that have been added to Signal recently and we want that momentum to continue.  However, the sheer volume of legacy issues, combined with submissions that completely ignore the provided issue template, has created a situation where there are currently more than 1,100 open tickets. Most of these issues have been inactive for several years and they reference versions of Signal that are no longer available. Many open issues are essentially ad-hoc discussion threads or feature requests that are a better fit for the [community forum](https://community.signalusers.org). Perhaps most importantly, many of these issues lack debug logs, descriptions, and the steps that would be necessary to understand and reproduce the reported behavior.  ## A new beginning We need to get to a point where we can effectively track actual issues in the GitHub repository. We're aware of the features that users want, and we're working hard on them every day. Community involvement plays a large role in our development and planning process, and we closely follow the forums and other feedback channels.  We are taking the following steps in order to turn this repository into a functional issue tracker for bug reports:  1. The [issue template](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) has been updated to indicate that GitHub issues should only be used to track existing bugs in Signal.    * If you feel like you are unable to make an idea fit within the confines of the template, that might be a sign that you are about to submit something that isn't a bug.    * If you disagree with the way that a feature is working (but it's working!) that's not a bug.    * If you have a suggestion for a new feature, that's also not a bug.    * The [community forum](https://community.signalusers.org) is available for all non-bug submissions and discussions. This feedback is highly valuable, but our GitHub issue tracker is not the right venue for questions, comments, or feature requests. 2. We will routinely close issues that ignore or delete the issue template. 3. Legacy issues that are more than one month old will be closed by an automated process as part of this cleanup effort.  ## Out with the old, in with the new and improved Users are welcome to re-submit bug reports that follow the updated issue template and that still affect the current release of Signal. By re-submitting valid issues with up-to-date reproduction steps (and debug logs that were produced by a recent version of Signal) the developers will be better equipped to solve any underlying problems. Please include the legacy issue ID in your new submission if there is important context available in the old thread.  We need the community to help us with this step, and we sincerely appreciate your participation in this cleanup effort.  Many of you have been asking for this for a long time. We believe that these actions will improve the development cycle and make the process easier to follow for everyone involved. We apologize in advance for the flood of email notifications, but the pain is temporary and a brighter future awaits.","closed","","jlund-signal","2018-04-02T21:07:01Z","2019-02-05T18:11:51Z"

With signal you can make communications instantly while avoiding SMS fees, create groups so that you can chat with all friends at once and share media or attachments all with complete privacy. The server also never stores any of your data to prove that it's very private.    #### Actual behavior However when I clicked on the write button/ new message button and try searching for a user the app keeps crashing and fluctuating.  ![Screenshot_20180319-181132_1521479986664.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1521480110/no0u5ixtnclvlhw0fhy4.jpg)  #### How to reproduce * Download signal private messenger app from Google Play Store  * Try writing a new message * Then try searching  for a user  * The app either crashes or takes you back to the first page or home.   * Browser: Google Play Store / Signal Private Messenger  * Operating system: Android 7.0 * version number: 4.16.9  #### Recording Of The Bug https://youtu.be/eWTM0UqvguI","closed","","yhaulez","2018-03-21T08:43:21Z","2018-03-22T17:53:03Z"
