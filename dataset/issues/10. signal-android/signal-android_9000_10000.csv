"","2698","When using Voice+, outgoing SMS via TextSecure don't send","~~Voice+ (VoicePlus) seemed to work fine with TS in #27, but seems to be failing now.~~ EDIT: Assumed it was working, but skimmed too quickly, and it appears it hadn't worked before.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/20e05fe900419aed8089 - Nexus 4 (mako)  - CyanogenMod 11, M11 shapshot. - TextSecure 2.7.0-B1 ### To Reproduce 1. Install Google Voice app 2. Enable Voice+ 3. Set GV to ""Receive text messages"", and enable ""Text notifications"" (they will be suppressed by V+) 4. Set stock SMS app as default. Try sending and receiving via that app successfully (via GV data). 5. Set TextSecure as default. Receving works fine, but sending gets stuck, with long-press msg details showing:  > **Sent** - > **Via** Pending...  (I wasn't trying on totally fresh phone wipe, but I can retry that later if it would uncomplicate things.) ### Expected Behaviour  It seemed that the Voice+ system app allowed any regular SMS app to send/receive using Google Voice. I'll have to look into how TS might act differently.  EDIT: cc @lachesis since you seemed interested once upon a time :)","closed","","patcon","2015-03-16T06:29:57Z","2015-03-16T06:52:23Z"

"","3134","Cursor not shown when typing a message","You know the little pulsing bar that appears when writing something in a text box? (I'm sure i thas a name but I can't think of a better description right now). Since 2.14.1 (probably 2.14) it has disappeared from textsecure. This obviously makes it hard and uncomfortable to write messages.. I like textsecure, and I appreciate the effort you're putting into it, really. But do you even test the app before releasing updates? Missing commas that screw the phones and make us lose messages, huge usability problems that would've taken 10 seconds to notice... I mean... of course it's human to forget a comma or introduce bugs, we all know it. The problem is that testing should be considered _fundamental_, even when you have beta testers. Beta testers are supposed to find smaller problems, not sacrifice their product for the sake of bugs. That's what the developers should be doing. Apologies if it sounds rude, and thanks again.","closed","","ghost","2015-05-08T08:18:12Z","2015-05-14T17:09:07Z"

"","2421","Can't correctly translate plurals in TextSecure on Transifex","With the latest strings added to the TextSecure project on Transifex there is no way for me to correctly translate them to my language (Slovenian). Transifex has native support for plurals but it seems it only works if the original entries are added correctly. This worked on other projects but it doesn't work with TextSecure.  From the Transifex documentation:  ""Transifex has native support for plurals, as long as the format itself supports them. Formats that can deal with plurals are for instance Gettext and Android .xml files.  When Transifex encounters a pluralized entry in the file, it will associate both plural forms together. This way, Transifex can present the translator with both forms in the editor. At the same time, Transifex knows how many plural forms each language has and asks the translator to fill in all of them. That is, the translator cannot save the entry, unless he fills in all plural forms in the specified language.""  http://docs.transifex.com/developer/formats/","closed","","bungabunga","2015-02-07T09:40:51Z","2015-02-09T19:24:58Z"

On a larger note, it might be worth considering a model where we use EventBus or Otto and AsyncTask simply broadcasts an event on finish. Activities and Fragments can choose to only listen for events when their UI is ready to react to them. By now it's become obvious that any AsyncTasks that end in unchecked UI operations are a bad idea.","closed","","mcginty","2015-04-09T00:47:41Z","2015-04-09T18:19:35Z"

Open 'All images' from a conversation that has so many of your precious photos that you need to scroll to see them all 2. Scroll down and pull up before new images are fully visible (do this move gently, don't jerk like a machine) 3. Continue scrolling down to expose new precious photos 4. Alternate between steps 2 and 3 as long as you wish (or until your lifespan expires) 5.

"","3125","Increase text input box size as message grows","When typing a message longer than a single line, TextSecure allows the user to scroll the input box left and right in order to see the whole input.  It would be nice if instead of this scrolling function the box simply gained another line as the length of the message increased. This would allow the user to always see the entire message without scrolling.   While this would take up slightly more vertical space, this would be especially useful when reviewing the message before sending (say, to make sure nothing was autocorrected incorrectly). Plus, TextSecure already increases the input area, though only to show the number of characters when they go past the 160 character mark.

Now, sometimes (not all the time, but pretty often), the following happens: - message turns dark blue - once I get the delivery receipt, its icon appears - message turns bright blue  I think I read somewhere that the bubble turns bright blue once the server has queued the message. So that should happen ""way"" before the delivery receipt makes its way to my phone. Since that's not the case, I think it would be cool to turn the bubble bright blue as soon as a delivery receipt is received. Otherwise you could color the bubble bright blue as soon as the message reaches the server (it would give the users the impression that messages are being sent faster, which would be good. The app seems slowish right now).","closed","ux,","ghost","2015-01-26T15:29:28Z","2015-10-23T18:50:13Z"

The issue occurs when TextSecure is in focus and the screen is shut off, either by power button or timeout. The screenshot then persists in Overview/Recents until TextSecure is dismissed from the list, even across reboots.  ""Screen security"" is enabled, and logs indicate both that `FLAG_SUPPORTS_PROTECTED_BUFFERS` is enabled on the display, and that the screen capture should have failed with `W/SurfaceFlinger﹕ FB is protected: PERMISSION_DENIED`.

The green background is exactly the same as when a message is sent (maybe unencrypted?) over SMS because PUSH was no longer available for that user (or maybe some other reason).  When a message failed to send, and was actually not sent, and needs to either be resent or deleted, feels like there could be a better colour than green. Maybe a grey background to suggest that it's not sent, sort of greyed out, or maybe something red to suggest failure.

"","3080","Everyone who has my phone number can figure out that I use textsecure","We live in times where even the fact that somebody's using encryption raises suspicions. In my eyes a first suspicious sign would be a telephone number which is stored in a database of a messenger like TextSecure. Gathering those is a low hanging fruit because we all know that the structure of telephone numbers is very deterministic and entropy of those is additionally reduced by TextSecure. Another reason is that some people just don't like that everyone who has ones telephone number knows that TextSecure is used.  I suggest to give more control over that. The easiest solution I can imagine is that there's a ""cloak"" mode:  Alice uses TextSecure. However, she doesn't want that Mallory knows that Alice is using that App so Alice activates the cloak mode. In this mode, every time Mallory searches for intersections on the server Alices token is ignored.  To get in touch with a cloaked user, I suggest the following approach:  Bob wants to contact Alice. Alice is still in cloaking mode. Bob can select Alice from his phone contacts for a contact request. Alice receives this request. If she acknowledges, Bob get notified that Alice is available. If Alice ignores the request, nothing happens.  Other, less convenient solutions I thought of: - It's not possible that Mallory can see Alice in the intersection request if Alice doesn't have Mallory in her contact list. (Here the server whould have to know and store contact link information which is bad.) - There's a kind of challenge-response technique via another channel than TextSecure which allows Bob to add Alice to the contacts. (More complicated and requires a second channel)  What do you think?  Greetings, Noir","closed","","Noir-","2015-04-29T08:41:29Z","2015-04-29T14:24:47Z"

"","3144","Cursor occasionally missing when opening a conversation","This is something I encountered while trying to reproduce #3134 of which I cut 'n' pasted my comments here because the issue appears to be separate.  Sometimes when I open a conversation the cursor is missing. This happens on average 5% of the time. The cursor comes back when you tap the input box though. I speculate this issue was introduced in 2.14(.1) but I'm not sure if I would have noticed anything without #3134.  Here are some tests I ran while trying to pin it down: - for each conversation in the main conversation list   - repeat (30, 50 or 100 times)     - open the conversation     - count if cursor shows or not     - tap Android's back button to go back to main conversation list  **Nexus 4, Android 5.1, TS 2.14.1**  ``` 1st priv. conv. 1: 0/50 (ok after 50 tries nothing, i give up) 2nd priv. conv. 2: 3/30 3rd priv. conv. 3: 5/30 4th priv. conv. 4: 2/30 1st group conv. 1: 1/30 5th priv. conv. 5: 2/30 6th priv. conv. 6: 0/50 ```  Result: in 13/250 cases I got a missing cursor. The conversations that got 0% do not really differ from the others.  **Huawei U8880, Android 4.0.4, TS 2.14.1**  ``` 1st priv. conv. 1: 0/100 ```  Does not seem to happen on 4.0.4.

Here's [a debug log](https://gist.github.com/002810e2f0f66373fe91) from Lollipop after: - rebooting phone - opening TS - switching between the conversation list and a specific conversation until the cursor disappeared (took 16 tries)  I realize this is a _""new version of TextSecure makes my phone run 0.4 Fahrenheit colder than before and it's affecting my testicle balance when I keep my phone in my pocket""_ type of an issue but I'm doing this mostly for documentation.

Attach that picture to a TS message using the attachment gallery's _Recent_ tab (the gallery does not know that the picture was deleted) 3. You will get a missing thumbnail icon 4. Tap send 5.

First, we needed to wait until the thumbnail for the draft attachment is generated before sending so it can be passed through to be inserted into the PartDatabase properly. Otherwise, we get a race that generates two thumbnails and takes _way_ more memory.  Second, it seems like there's a race between the message being inserted into MmsDatabase and the parts being inserted into the part database. The CursorLoader would get notified that the dataset changed underneath it, and if the parts weren't inserted into the database by the time the listview refreshed, there would be no media slides available. To fix this, I just threw the message insertion into a transaction so we can still get the messageId properly, but the data set change event isn't triggered until the parts also exist.  As sugar on top, I think it will be better to show an error indicator in a message instead of just a little triangle tick, so did that too.","closed","","mcginty","2015-04-25T21:13:30Z","2015-04-29T22:44:53Z"

I then am presented with a message stating that I should tap for further details. After tapping I see a message detail dialog together with a list of all group members and separate ""send again"" buttons for every member.  Problem: Whenever I tap on one of those buttons the message is not only resent to this specific member but to the whole group. To get rid of all buttons I would need to tap them all, thereby causing the message to be sent multiple times to every person. I see that there might be cases in which some members have got the message while others have not. In that case it would be good if the button would only cause a resend to this specific account. Often, it will be the case that none of the members got the message because the network issue is on the sender side. In that case, a ""send again to whole group"" button would be preferable.","closed","ux,","shaaati","2015-03-10T18:22:26Z","2018-04-02T21:33:32Z"

I.e. a checkmark for successful delivery should only be displayed if all parts arrived, and a send error should result in the whole message being marked as failed (light background plus red triangle icon). Additionally TS should continuously try to deliver the message again (or the failed parts thereof, if the SMS protocols allow that).","closed","ux,","devurandom","2015-02-03T04:10:12Z","2015-10-24T10:17:23Z"

Only unencrypted conversations are still possible, we are **forced** to register! 2. You silently removed encrypted SMS (not mentioned on GooglePlay)! 3. TextSecure Messages are **NOT** possible without Google Play Services.  So that means: Phones of privacy-aware users that are very likely rooted and have **no Google Play Services** are being ""set on fire"" by just disabling the encryption of all conversations, not notifying the user that the whole encryption thingy has just vanished. Furthermore, people are being **forced** to register with the TextSecure Messages Server based in the USA. The people (like me) who refuse to flash GApps for adding Google Play Services (because they know that with those services you enable Google to remotely monitor your phone) are just doomed in this case. @moxie0, I've always loved TextSecure and RedPhone, but this is just unacceptable for privacy-aware people like me.

The null check and `-1` check on `this.recipients` and `this.threadId` is to handle the case of a new conversation thread where the list of messages would be empty-- in this case no `ListAdapter` is set so these checks prevent an NPE within two of the `LoaderManager` callbacks.

"","2607","Plead to reject the plans for dropping MMS/SMS support.","I'm writing this in hope of you deciding to keep the MMS/SMS support.  My personal experience of using the push messages has been poor. Too many times has my messages never arrived to the person I'm trying to contact. This problem has been catastrophic when the arrival of the message was critical. Even worse when it's a urgent message that needs quick response, this has occurred to me on several occasions; which in turn caused me some troubles (Multiple times)! Personally I can not describe me experience with regular SMS anywhere near as poor as the push messages.  With regard to the poor experience with the push messages service and the severe limitations of the current plans; I do not believe your reasons warrant reason to remove support for MMS/SMS. I would rather have MMS/SMS only and drop the push messages.  Worth mentioning: currently contacting friends who're out of the country renders TextSecure virtually useless because no one currently has the data plan enabled while roaming. Keeping it on MMS/SMS mode circumvents this problem.  Regarding polling of new members; I don't see why the app still doesn't check for new contacts while using the MMS/SMS service, this can be worked around...  Since I've had a poor experience with the push messages on several occasions; I've been using TextSecure as a MMS/SMS client which had support for OTR, I had it all working in one single app.  If MMS/SMS is dropped from TextSecure; I'll likely discontinue my use of TextSecure.","closed","","0xACE","2015-03-07T00:38:15Z","2015-03-07T00:40:38Z"

Today I tried the same (send a message to a TS contact while no data connection available)  with this results: 1. TS does not ask what to do 2.

Second - I had to use this issue-tracker to find out how to accomplish sending a SMS within an ongoing encrypted chat.... its kind of hidden.)  Suggestion: just ask the user via a pop-up what to do in situations where no data connection is available: 1. Send over SMS right away (only unencrypted) 2.

So I will restate the question here:  A friend of mine has the problem that he doesn't receive TextSecure messages when he isn't on a wifi connection but on mobile network. For me that works fine.  Does anyone have an idea how to solve this issue?","closed","","KommX","2015-02-23T11:26:48Z","2015-02-23T17:58:57Z"

If I open the contacts app (on Android 5.0) and choose a contact to share, TextSecure is not available in the list of applications that I could use to share the contact info...  I really like the way WhatsApp handles contact sharing, but I have no idea if there is a chance to get a similar way of sharing contacts in Textsecure...  I have to admit I'm not a developer and these are just some ideas I have, but I don't know if it is possible for you to implement it. In my opinion this would be a nice improvement for TS :)  EDIT: I guess the problem with the missing sharing option in the Android contacts app has already been issue #1407 .

Now I read in your blog that you are going to handle message delivery by yourselves. This is really nice. One thing though: You want to go for GCM for wakeup events - That means GCM would be mandatory for TextSecure. What about using a different mechanism - a periodically check, manual check, whatever. As long as GCM would be optional I would be very glad, lot's of other ppl possibly as well and this would be a good compromise for the gone encrypted SMS.

Now, it is just another encrypted IM chat program, unable to do SMS, and its original point its lost. It should not be called TextSecure anymore... Call it ""Signal for Android"" or something and fork TextSecure at version 2.6...  I do not have a data plan. I do not have google apps installed. I can not use my favorite app anymore.  I was SO ANGRY today and also so sad because something i loved just died.  Moxie, you are making a HUGE mistake.  Some people don't want to use Gapps. Some people don't have a data plan. Some people travel through areas where they can't get data but the standard SMS channel is available. Some people don't want to use limited data when they can use their unlimited SMS plan.  These people were just told to go fuck themselves. I feel offended, insulted, hurt.  These people are probably either highly security-conscious users who don't trust google or people who just don't want a data plan... they are not the enemy, Moxie, they WERE loyal users of TextSecure.  You could still develop the push system without taking away the SMS fallback system. There should at least be a fallback system.  And for security, what protects us from man-in-the-middle attacks now? If keys can be reissued whenever what stops a man-in-the-middle from distorting the keys to trigger a new swap then capturing the new keys? I don't feel comfortable with the push system even if I could use it.  THIS IS A TEXT MESSAGING APP, not a damn chat program.  I DONT CARE IF THE TELCOS HAVE METADATA ON ME. Why do you think you can force me to care about that? I care much more about not having Gapps on my phone.

"","3074","SMS fallback","I have read some closed/locked issues on this matter already, but I just want to add an extra push. There was argument that TextSecure is to be a secure messaging facility, and fallback to insecure communication is unacceptable.  I want to argue that this position is unreasonable, and undermines the effort to get the general public onto secure platforms. The general public has practically zero concern about this; but I do. If text secure refuses to fallback to SMS, then nobody I want to communicate will install the app. The inconvenience of not being able to communicate when out of 3G range (I'm in Australia, we barely have internet in this country), or have exhausted your monthly data allowance (again, I'm in Australia), is more than anyone should have to tolerate.  There is only one reasonable solution to this as I see it: TextSecure should attempt to send a message securely. If it can't, a popup informs the user it failed to send, and the user has an option to retry later, or send insecurely (via SMS) immediately. There should also be a ""remember my choice"" checkbox, and an option in the settings.  I have people refusing to install, and uninstalling the app.  TextSecure is the only decent, otherwise user-friendly, secure messaging app I have managed to find. All others are borked in various critical ways.  Please consider the importance of this app _actually being used_ by an exponential explosion of users; 99% of whom don't give a damn whether it's secure, but must be convinced to use it by the 1% of people who do.","closed","","TurkeyMan","2015-04-28T09:16:28Z","2015-04-28T14:33:26Z"

After quite a bit of trial and error, I was able to reproduce this with other contacts by adding/removing non-breaking spaces.  So I just used `PhoneNumberUtils.stripSeparators()` to remove those characters so that `SmsManager` wouldn't throw any exceptions, and that solves the issue.  This might be the reason for the issue described in the note in the code.  If I had to guess where the non-breaking space came from in my contact, I would say that it had to do with the web interface of Google Contacts (but that's just speculation).","closed","","brenns10","2015-05-02T19:47:19Z","2015-05-06T17:21:29Z"

I'm not savvy on all the material design guidelines from google so if I have ideas that break that you know why. :) Here goes: 1. The light theme has a blue bar on the top.  The dark theme is black.  I don't know which is more palatable but it might look pretty slick if the textsecure icon or the top bar was also blue in the dark theme. 2. When there is an unread message it shows the time in blue.  I like the color idea but should the color match the security level, i.e. green for SMS, blue for TS messages? 3. The ""TextSecure"" text at the top doesn't look bold like the same text in the light theme.  Don't know which is right but they should probably match. 4. In the ""Settings"" area, the checkbox for push has a sea green or aqua background which looks kinda pukey to me.  I'd like to see it blue like in the light theme or maybe have it be black and the checkmark be blue.  This is in the ""Advanced"" area of ""Settings"" too. 5. This one is actually in both dark and light: The lock, phone and option menu dots in the top right take up enough space that most if not all my contacts names are partially truncated with the ellipses.  Not a huge deal but is there a way to re-arrange that area to show the whole name?  Thanks again for the effort put behind TextSecure and all the other apps you guys work on.  Really truly great stuff; you guys are like coding gymnasts.  I hope these are helpful and not a waste of time.","closed","ux,","jeremymasters","2015-02-11T00:23:26Z","2016-04-14T23:13:16Z"

I am part of a student group from the Delft University of Technology, following a course on Software Architecture. We have picked TextSecure as our Open Source project of interest and are at the moment tasked to try to contribute something. Which brings me to this pull request.  Changing the theme or language returns the user to the main settings screen, which can be jarring for the user. If you accidentally tapped on the wrong language this also makes it harder find your way back. This PR keeps the user at the appearance screen by redisplaying that Fragment after the Activity is recreated, when this scenario applies.

"","2964","TextSecure marks messages as delivered before they are even sent (?)","Hi, I've always wondered why this is, but just figured it may be some sort of bug. Like 80% of the time, the messages I send get the delivery receipt symbol (the check mark) ""way"" before they turn blue (meaning they have been sent). Basically I send a message, it is shown as pending, it gets the delivery check mark, and then it is shown as sent. And this happens all the time, way more than just half the time. I thought messages turned blue after they'd reached the server, and got the check mark once they'd been delivered. But how is it possible that going from my phone to the recipient's phone and back takes less than going from my phone to the server and back? Sometimes I get the delivery receipt several seconds before the message is marked as sent. Is this some problem with the server being slower at some tasks than others, or is it some problem with the client? Thank you","closed","","ghost","2015-04-13T09:08:08Z","2015-10-22T19:40:24Z"

Since she doesn't open sms with TS, we don't know the plain text of these sms either (maybe there's method to decrypt them using our keys ?).  Timestamps of push messages sent by me do not match the timestamps of her recieved sms.

"","3299","Convert AsyncTask to IntentService","Hi `TextSecure` developers, I'm doing research on Android async programming, particularly on  AsyncTask and IntentService. AsyncTask can lead to memory leak and losing task result when GUI is recreated during task running (such as orientation change). [This article](http://bon-app-etit.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-dark-side-of-asynctask.html) describes the problems very well.   We discussed with some Android experts and they agree with this issue, and claim that AsyncTask can be considered only for short tasks (less than 1 second). However, using IntentService (or AsyncTaskLoader) can avoid such problems since their lifecycles are independent from `Activity`/`Fragment`.  In `TextSecure`, the AsyncTasks are declared as non-static inner classes of `Activity`/`Fragment`. So the above issue can occur (especially for relatively long tasks).  I refactored 9 AsyncTasks in `TextSecure` to IntentService (in 8 separate commits), with the help of a refactoring tool we developed. Do you think using IntentService should be better in some of these 9  scenario? Do you want to merge some commits in this pr? Thanks.","closed","","yulin2","2015-06-01T19:29:25Z","2015-06-22T17:25:24Z"

Unfortunately I couldn't make a screenshot of it because I saw it happen on someone else's device.  It was a HTC Desire (Bravo) with an 3.7 inch 480×800 pixel screen running TextSecure 2.10.2 on an [unofficial 4.4.4 KitKat based CyanogenMod 11.0 ROM](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2549776) with system font size set to maximum.  When the Emoji drawer was set to the recent (clock icon) category or to the people (smiley icon) category, then everything seemed to be fine.  But when the Emoji drawer was set to another category, like the nature (flower icon) category for example, then the Emoji drawer was growing a bit towards the left side of the screen, essentially making it render outside of the visible screen area (it became wider than the actual screen width).  On a LG G2 with stock 4.4.2 KitKat ROM, this does not happen.  So maybe it's related to the low screen resolution of the HTC Desire (Bravo).

Also the vertical scrollbar is not placed directly on the outside of the Emoji drawer. There is a lot of empty space between the right outside and the scrollbar.  Even when I reduce the system font size to minimum, [which makes the Emojis smaller](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/2937), I only get up to seven Emojis in one row on a display with 1080 pixels in width.

Could you please shift the vertical scrollbar more to the right and use the empty space on the left and right side for actual content (i.e. Emojis), so that the space is not being wasted?

A lot of Android phones do not have the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emoji set as their native system Emoji set though.  Samsung uses their own Emoji set, LG uses their own Emoji set, HTC uses their own Emoji set and so on...  You can see some of those Emoji sets over there:  http://emoji.codes/family  Unfortunately though, TextSecure does not replace the native system Emojis with the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emojis, when the native system Emojis are not the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emojis, like on Samsung, LG and HTC devices for example.  So, when Samsung/LG/HTC users tap on one of the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emojis in the TextSecure Emoji drawer, a Samsung/LG/HTC Emoji appears in the message input box and in the messages themselves, and not the Google ""Noto Color Emoji"" Emojis the user actually selected.

We're a group of activists in an oppressive regime, trying to establish an IM-type of secure medium to communicate our initiatives among each other.  TextSecure has been, theoretically, the ideal medium for us for so long. Yet, we never used it because it requires Phone Numbers. Hashed or not, our problem with that is not a ""trust"" problem against the server, but the problem is that if one of us is searched/caught, there's absolutely zero plausible deniability for him to deny his immediate knowledge if the people he's communicating with. The oppressor can simply collect the phone numbers I have on my phone (after a good beating to make me unlock the app from its passphrase), and take down all of the group.  **We need the ability to use usernames** (preferably also making an option to FORCE Tor before the app can download or upload ANYTHING). That way, if one is caught, he won't be (as much of) a danger to us all, as if he had all our phone numbers  in the chat screen. He will be able to use his cover story to deny and save us and maybe even himself.  Please consider that. We're struggling to get a secure medium for our communication. XMPP is not the way to go when it comes to Group Chat, and other Closed Source apps are just never the correct go-to app.  This app is absolutely perfect, if only it allows us to completely get rid of phone numbers. Not just for people whom I don't have their phone numbers, but even for my contacts that are in my phone book. We need a way to not reference phone numbers in TextSecure AT ALL.  Please make it happen.

If I understand it correctly, in the same manner as RedPhone the feature of end-to-end encryption of SMS now works only if TextSecure is used with GCM/APN (textsecure-backend + signal-ios).  If that's correct, would it be possible to bring this feature back as optional feature in application settings? I'm willing to invest time into putting the feature back into code, if the team of developers agree with it being put back in official releases on Google Play.  I think that application with such large community is able to push the feature forward better, than forcing users to choose between TextSecure PUSH and eg. Tinfoil SMS GSM solution, using non-compatible ciphers (see the tinfoil-sms issue 70 [3]).

"","3193","SMS as auto-fallback","Hello,  I think it would be really nice if a textsecure message has not been received it auto-retries using the unsecured SMS (ofcourse, only optional, disabled by defalt). This is useful in many situations like roaming or even when you want to save battery and disable push or mobile networking completely (and someone else tries to reach you).  So what I propose is to add an option to notify the user when his textsecure message has not been recieved for X minutes and/or add an option to automatically send the same text via SMS to make sure it reaches the other one – ditching the security for a moment when other things are more important. For ""normal"" textsecure users this can be a rather frequent annoyance.  EDIT: If possible, maybe one should delete the secured TextSecure message if the auto-falback SMS has been sent to avoid double-sending","closed","","ljrk0","2015-05-19T10:34:31Z","2015-05-19T12:42:13Z"
"","3079","How to restore SMS encryption?","Hello,  I just installed latest TextSecure and if I knew what it does, I would backup the APK file. Unfortunately, I didn't and the change involving the removal of SMS encryption feature was not mentioned in the changelog, so I unwillingly removed a feature from my phone that I really care about. Is there a way to restore the SMS encryption, either by installing an older APK or by changing that using some hidden option? I evaluated the risks and while being a security conscious man, I would prefer to use outdated software in this case than no encryption at all - encryption using the internet is unfortunately out of option for me.  I really hope that somebody could help me, otherwise I would have to compile textsecure myself, which doesn't seem trivial. I am willing to donate to the project if this feature can be restored on my phone.  Jacek","closed","","d33tah","2015-04-29T08:26:35Z","2015-04-29T14:23:25Z"
"","2892","The Google Emoji set in TextSecure-Android sometimes differs noticeably from the Apple Emoji set in Signal-iOS and therefore might get lost in translation. Please use a more similar Emoji set, like the ""Emoji One"" Emoji set or the Twitter ""Twemoji"" Emoji set for example.","Hello,  I have not yet had the chance to use the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer (https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/commit/2f20bb89f3b64701d047fa3af2aa8b6e0ecfdc34) myself, since TextSecure 2.10.x still seems to be in beta.  But I now saw that you seem to be using the Google Emojis for the internal TextSecure Emoji drawer, or at least I assume that's what you are doing by looking at this:  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/tree/master/assets  There is an issue with this though.  Signal-iOS of course is using the Apple Emojis. And they sometimes look very different from the Google Emojis.  You can see a comparison between the Apple Emojis and the Google Emojis over there:  http://www.explodedsoda.com/2013/07/ios-to-google-hangout-emoji-comparison.html  As you can see, they sometimes look very different.  So they can easily get lost in translation.  There is an whole article about this issue, which describes the issue quite well, see the following article:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html  There are some alternative Emoji sets available though, which look more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set does.  And they even are open source.  For example:  There is the Twitter Emoji set called ""Twemoji"", see:  https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone https://github.com/twitter/twemoji  The Twemoji set looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set, see the following comparison for example:  http://mroth.github.io/emojicompare/  As you can see, the Twemoji set looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set does.  And there also is the ""Emoji One"" Emoji set, see:  http://emojione.com/ https://github.com/Ranks/emojione  The Emoji One Emoji set also looks more similar to the Apple Emoji set.  Here is a big comparison chart where you can compare them (the chart even has the Twemoji set and the Google Emoji set):  http://emoji.codes/family  As you can see, the Twemoji set and the Emoji One set are both more similar to the Apple Emoji set than the Google Emoji set is.  So, could you please use the Twemoji or Emoji One Emoji set or something similar in TextSecure-Android instead of using the Google Emoji set, to lessen the risk of them getting lost in translation (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html) when chatting with Signal-iOS users?

"","2954","A lot of Emojis are missing from Emoji drawer and Emoji ordering and categorization is incorrect","Hello,  a lot of Emojis are missing from the TextSecure Emoji drawer.  When I say a lot of Emojis are missing, then I am not referring to the fact that [TextSecure is using an outdated Emoji set](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/2894).  What I mean is that they are actually missing and should be there even in the oudated Emoji set.  I also noticed that the Emoji ordering and categorization is incorrect.  The Emojis in the categories have a different ordering than they should have and some Emojis are placed in the wrong categories.  The issue seems to be caused by the actual source files, see:  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/assets/emoji_0_wrapped.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/assets/emoji_1_wrapped.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/assets/emoji_2_wrapped.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/assets/emoji_3_wrapped.png https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/assets/emoji_4_wrapped.png  Because those source files exhibit the same issues as mentioned above.  Here is a list of the Emojis which should be available in the outdated set and the list also shows the expected ordering and categorization of the Emojis, see (you can toggle between the different categories by clicking on the smiley/flower/bell/car/symbols icons in the upper right corner above the list):  http://emoji.codes/family  But please note that Apple already seems to have introduced/adopted a new Emoji category / ordering system in their latest OS updates, see:  > http://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-2015-emoji-changelog-ios-os-x >  > **Emoji Categories** >  > Prepare to re-learn the position of your favorite emojis, > as they have all changed.

Objects & Symbols is now > a catch-all for the more obscure remaining characters.  So, maybe it would make sense to adopt that new system.  So, could you please add all the missing Emojis ([and ideally update to the new set while being at it](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/2894)) and correct the ordering of the Emojis either to the [traditional system](http://emoji.codes/family) or to the [new system that Apple is already using](http://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-2015-emoji-changelog-ios-os-x)?

Besides which, my phone already beeps when I get a message, and I have the notification on my lock screen (with info hidden), and the TextSecure icon is already in the top bar once I unlock and have a new message (the same as I have for emails and other messages/notifications from other apps).

Here we keep a reference to the inflated views in order to unbind them whenever they become unused.  Because views are recycled while scrolling the adapter, the HashSet stays the same size dependant on how many rows are visible on screen, regardless of how many contacts you've scrolled through.  I used Square's new LeakCanary library to detect the leak and confirm the fix.","closed","","herbig","2015-05-21T05:18:58Z","2018-06-11T03:46:23Z"

When I send messages (especially if I send many, one after the other), it looks like it takes a while (several seconds) for textsecure to start sending the data, like I wasn't connected to the internet, but I am. In the notification bar, I don't see the upload/download arrows highlighted, it's like it's not even trying to connect. Sometimes it takes less time to turn on and back off airplane mode to fix the issue than to wait until it starts sending the data. The wifi works perfectly fine, by the way.

Horrible lag. EmojiView is a nano-ImageView/TextView hybrid that has a very fast draw cycle, making it great for having dozens of them on screen at a time.

"","3035","Speed up textsecure","First of all, I apologize if this is a duplicate of #981. I would like the developers to work on making TS a real instant messenger. Right now, even assuming everything goes well when sending a message, it still takes way (way!) more than other popular messengers. I don't know if it's because of the encryption or because of what mentioned in 981, or something else. What I know is that from the second I hit send, it takes some time before the message appears in the conversation, then some time to get sent and some time to get delivered (though usually the last two are inverted). It takes too long. Now, ""some time"" isn't a minute, but the process of sending is not at all instantaneous. I am basically begging my friends to use textsecure, but they keep complaining because ""no way, it's too slow"". To which I don't know what to answer. It does feel much slower than whatsapp. Is this because you don't have enough servers? Or is it a problem of the client itself?","closed","","ghost","2015-04-22T16:12:21Z","2015-04-22T16:28:10Z"

However, when attempting to send messages to the second number , only the ""Send unsecure SMS"" and ""Send secured SMS"" options are presented, so TextSecure messages can not be sent to the second number.

"","2733","created a set of basic espresso tests.","Created a set of basic espresso tests. // FREEBIE  All these espresso tests pass on my Nexus One running Android 2.3.6 and Nexus 5 running Android 5.1 (with animations disabled). Some notes from my experience with the espresso testing framework: ## out-of-app activities  The display of any activities or prompts that come from outside the app being tested trigger a failure of the current test. This means that through espresso it is not possible to set TextSecure as the default SMS app (post Kit-Kat) and depending on device, opening the notification sound preference also results in test failure. Choosing media for attachments and group images also currently shouldn't work, however, I expect that the future in-app media capture will be testable by espresso. ## Espresso.closeSoftKeyboard()  At the moment this method doesn't block, this sometimes leads to tests failing because the keyboard is covering a view under test. On emulators this reportedly isn't a problem but on real devices it is a definite confirmed issue. Two workarounds exist:  1) Thread.sleep() 2) install any 3rd party soft keyboard  Both are gross, but I think `1` is less gross. To avoid sporadic test failues use the `actuallyCloseSoftKeyboard()` method in place of `closeSoftKeyboard()` and `typeTextAndClose()` in place of `typeText()`. ## RoutingActivity makes stuff weird  Espresso kinda has this 'one activity one test' idea built in where you parameterize `ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2` with the activity you plan on testing. Then you can use this instance method `getActivity()` that returns an instance of the activity under test **and** creates it if necessary. The bummer of `RoutingActivity` is that when `getActivity()` is called you get a handle to a newly created `RoutingActivity` and not the activity you've been routed to, also if you've been routed to a new activity that activity will be destroyed. Having a handle to the activity under test is cool because it allows you to manipulate and test the activity lifecycle and get references to actual views, so, in conclusion, we can't do that stuff. ## options menus  All options menu items have to be matched using `withText()`, the more concrete `withId()` method simply doesn't work here. ## probably shouldn't fake push registration  An espresso test could be written to go through a valid registration flow but many test devices don't have SIM cards and I'm not sure we should count on internet access for anything either. Additionally I don't think we should attempt to fake a push registration state because keeping up with exactly what that state should look like with every new release is complicated and I also think it is outside the intent of espresso tests. I could be wrong about faking this state though, if it's trivial then it would definitely increase the # of things we could test, maybe this will get easier with the end of RoutingActivity.","closed","","rhodey","2015-03-20T22:25:04Z","2015-04-01T23:08:27Z"

Reference https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/pull/2331 for previous comments. ### `Intent` logic - Move routing logic to `PassphraseRequiredActionBarActivity` which routes based on application state just as `RoutingActivity` once did in days of olde. - Children activities now implement `onCreate(Bundle bundle, MasterSecret masterSecret)`, which is only called if we don't have to route elsewhere. - ShareActivity now handles `SEND` intents - ConversationListActivity is now the launcher entry-point - ConversationActivity handles SMS `SENDTO` intents ### `MasterSecret` - `MasterSecret`s are initialized in `PassphraseRequiredActionBarActivity`, and accessed via protected getter instead of being passed inter-Activity via parceled secrets. This means one MasterSecret object per activity that is cleared `onDestroy()`, so less chance of leak since fewer copies are made. - `MemoryCleaner`'s code was commented out, so just removed for now.

Ask before sending.  **Detailed description of issue** Since the update to TS 2.6.4 the fallback from Push to SMS (if there is no internet connection available) has stopped working. When I send the push, the message comes up as normal (""Do you want to use SMS...?""). If I confirm that I want to use SMS, the message turns to the usual green, indicating SMS mode, but after a while switches to blue (Push message). If I look into the ""Message details"" screen, it too says that it used the Push data channel. (As a footnote: the ""Message details"" screen doesn't respect the displkay/design options as well. I have TS set to the dark theme, the ""Message details"" screen, however, uses the bright theme. Maybe this contributes to the problem.) It's not just a display issue either: TS _does_ use the push data channel although I tell it to do SMS. Once I turn on the internet connection, the message _is_ delivered via push to the recipient (they confirm that they received them).","closed","","moeddlmann","2015-03-18T10:14:28Z","2015-03-22T20:24:51Z"
