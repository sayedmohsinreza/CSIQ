The same thing happened, this time I told android to send the info so there is probably a crash report from google.  I am not at home at the moment so I have to do the device info from memory, let me know if you need more details and I'll provide them at a later time. The device is a Sony Xperia Z5C, running unrooted, android 7(dot-something) and whatever the beta version of signal was yesterday (but I do not know if the problem only happens in the current beta).

Services like UserVoice, or any of its dozens of competitors, provide boards where users can vote on other previously-made feature requests, create their own feature requests, or provide feedback and further details on an existing feature request.  https://i.imgur.com/rTVBTb1.png  In my experience, feature requests are a bit convoluted now in that the user must either create a Github account and familiarize themselves with Github before making a request, or they must provide feedback through the [Signal support site](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/requests/new), where it's not clear whether or not their request will even be seen, read, or replied to.  There's also the issue that feature requests don't typically apply to a specific platform, but rather to Signal as a whole, which makes it even more confusing for me to be posting this here, in the Android repo, rather than elsewhere where it would make more sense.  The advantage of this is:  1. Users can see what's been previously requested (fewer duplicates) 2. Users can vote on what's most important to them 3. Users can provide feedback and additional details on existing requests (to flesh out the feature) 4. Users get to see what the team at Signal may or may not be considering as a feature 5. Users don't need Github accounts, or need to familiarize themselves with Github, before making a feature request 6. It encourages users to take part the in feature process, including design, feedback, etc.  Let me know what you think!","closed","","user849651","2020-09-06T15:53:17Z","2020-09-08T13:13:03Z"

Phone: Pixel 3a, Android 10, 5 aug 2020 Service: Google Fi  The problem below happens about every other time I travel to rural areas of the U.S. So far I have been able to unregister and reregister, but not this time.  I travel extensively through very rural parts of the U.S. south-west, Navajo Nation, etc where vast swaths have no service at all, and much of it is mixed voice-only, voice+SMS, non-data, etc. Roaming is unreliable and spotty. I eventually return to Los Angeles (full service).  About three days into a trip all incoming SMS and incoming Signal messages just stopped (discovered only when others told me out of band). I am able to send.  My goal is to get to baseline -- no Signal, receive SMS via google's Messages app, then start over.   On return home in Signal app, in settings I turned off messages and calls (""unregister""), within seconds I got a flood of SMS/MMS, picked up by the default Android Messages app. Dozens. However I was/am still unable to receive new texts.  I then uninstalled Signal, and went to the Signal.org URL to unregister: https://signal.org/signal/unregister/  Unregister fails.  When I enter phone number and country and click CALL or SMS the error ""Failed to connect to the server"" appears on the screen. See attached. All combinations of prefix, no prefix (+1, 01, etc), page refresh, no change. WHen I click the buttons grey out, floating circle-slash, then a second or two the error message.  Another Signal.org page re: unregistering talks about ""shortcode blacklist"", to call my provider to clear it. Google Fi support claims no knowledge nor access. No reason to believe this is pointful other than the signal help page mentions it.  Phone powered off, etc of course. Backed out Messages updates, reinstalled.   I'm stumped.

"","9632","""Introducing PINs"" screen is not dismissable","There is a critical bug in the latest version of Signal. It is not allowing me to view my messages.  ### Steps to Reproduce  1. Launch Signal 2. Observe full-screen ""Introducing PINs"" dialog preventing viewing of messages  ### Expected Behaviour  Launching Signal should show me my messages.  ### Actual Behaviour  There is no obvious way to view my messages.  ----  Last week there was a ""Create a PIN"" overlay over the bottom third of the screen that couldn't be dismissed. Thankfully it could at least be ignored. As of today this seems to no longer be the case. I now cannot access the message list without creating a PIN. Since I also use the Signal app for my non-Signal text messaging, I cannot send or receive ordinary text messages either.  I don't want to create a PIN. I don't care that you want to store my messages and restore them when I switch phones or whatever. I don't want you to. I would be much happier if I could trust that my messages are just gone after I delete the app rather than have them stored forever in the cloud. PINs do not increase my security and do not at all increase my trust of Signal.  It seems every couple of months there is some change, some new annoyance in Signal that forces me to change my behaviour. I hate this. I just want it to work like a normal messaging app.  This is a serious problem for me because the few people I have convinced to use Signal are now contacting me (over non-Signal messaging) to ask me what PINs are, why Signal is so complicated and doesn't ""just work"" compared to other messaging apps, and why I won't just talk to them over Facebook Messenger like everyone else. I am running out of answers for them. Either I will lose friends or I will lose Signal.","closed","","ludocode","2020-05-17T20:56:35Z","2020-05-22T15:22:25Z"

No one I know uses telegram, wire, xmpp or any other program but lots of people are switching to signal. Integrating it with am plain text message app was a stroke of genius.     - [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates (_but I am not very confident of my search; possibly I missed something_) - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description  I have been running signal for some time on stock android. Recently, I switched to LineageOS. I installed signal but skipped backup restore. It installed and was working fine for a week or so.   However now I wish to restore the backup. I understand from the documentation it must be uninstalled/reinstalled to do this.    I am unable to reinstall successfully; the app crashes at the verification screen.   ### Steps to reproduce  1. uninstall/reinstall signal    - from f droid store and also later apk from website 2. open signal 3. restore backup (phone reports it decrypts the messages)    - by way of troubleshooting, I have now attempted to skip backup as before; no difference in end result 4. enter phone number  **Actual result:**   screen comes up that says ""enter the code that was sent to [phone number]"" and the option to call instead of SMS. But after a second or less it closes itself; the app is quit. I don't get any SMS verification code. I can't use the voice option.   **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  On the first install, I recall seeing the number fill itself into the 6 boxes automagically.       **Other troubleshooting info**  * If I re open the app I can try again a couple times but eventually I get errored for doing it too much. I can wait and repeat this later.   * I assume this error comes from the server from which I infer that the request for verification code is being received. So maybe someone can figure out what problem could happen in that moment?  * I subsequently installed whatsapp and I did get the SMS verification successfully so I know that part of it works fine.  * *Maybe* one of the many apps I have installed in the past week is doing something to interfere somehow? I have been having lots of fun going through the free software options in f droid store.    * I actually thought I had solved the problem: I noticed that in [Blockada](https://blokada.org/) there was a blocked a connection from whisper-something-something server. To be simple I just uninstalled it and everything else that might be doing that kind of thing. Same problem though.    ### Device info   **Device:** samsung galaxy a5 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.71.5  ### Link to debug log  impossible to generate :(","closed","","CouldBeThis","2020-09-16T02:49:10Z","2020-10-05T19:11:41Z"

As per the User Community discussion, I have written some patches to Signal that stub out Google Play Services, Firebase Cloud Messaging and Machine Learning code, so Signal can build and run without these libraries, connecting via WebSocket. I mentioned this on the [F-Droid forums](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/ive-degoogled-signal-messenger/10443) and users were receptive to the idea of distributing a Signal build there that meets their FOSS requirements, however this has never worked out in the past; the [last time this was mentioned](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9044#issuecomment-534340623) Greyson indicated signing builds would be a holdup.  So, which approach would the Signal team prefer?  1.  Signal merges some of these patches and removes Google/Firebase code from the Website APK release. The hard part would be finding a replacement Machine Vision library for facial recognition; a Maps patch using OpenStreetMap is already in the pull request list. Signal could sign builds, F-Droid could build them reproducibly, and list Signal's own signed builds in its catalogue if they match. Signal gets more users on official builds and F-Droid users get an easy download and update experience. This would also benefit MicroG and perhaps Huawei users who can have trouble with Google connections. 2.  Allow F-Droid to list a forked and renamed client based on these patches e.g. how they distribute Fennec instead of Firefox. Users are made aware it's unofficial and might break. It'll likely miss a few features e.g. facial recognition. I'd advocate for keeping build expiry, so in the event updates stop, legacy clients won't persist beyond a couple of months. They build from source + patches and sign themselves. Should still be a net win for everyone.  In any case, could Signal please merge the patch to remove a few unnecessary calls to GMS APIs? They're all one-line tweaks (usually using Signal's existing Util library code e.g. hex conversion) and that would make maintenance easier! I've signed the CLA; the best source is the latest branch on my GitHub with -FOSS in the name (currently 4.69.6.0-FOSS). Thanks :).","closed","","tw-hx","2020-08-27T10:05:52Z","2022-07-20T12:08:21Z"

In the hospital we are using Signal on public tablets provided to patients, so that patients can communicate virtually with the healthcare team. We recently uncovered a credible security threat (https://community.signalusers.org/t/option-to-require-pin-to-access-settings/18345). We need to rapidly build and roll out a custom Signal Build with the settings area disabled. I have a small budget that could either be used to pay those who create the custom build or could be donated as thanks into the Signal community.    A custom Signal APK is required with the following modifications: 1) Settings Locked out so that users cannot change them (disable the top left corner button and the settings option accessible from the three dots menu in the top right corner) 2) Default Settings Changed: Privacy->Incognito Keyboard ->On, Privacy->PIN Reminders -> Off, Privacy ->Registration Lock-> On 3) Auto-Update disabled (so that our custom App is not replaced by the generic app during the next automated update). Ideally we might have a custom auto-update feature that only activated when a new Custom Version was ready for upload & installation.  Ideally we would make the Custom Build available publically so that other healthcare teams or other people who want to use Signal for communication on publically available / shared devices can use it.   Thank you to everyone who works on Sigal and thank you for considering this request. Sincerely, Dr. Doug Brown.

I installed Signal App 4.71.5 (7082) I start typing a message, I select emoji, I have to scroll through all emoji searching for the one I want. The little search tab that I have on the signal desktop app is missing in the android app. No typing on the keyboard brings up any emoji selection. The only way to select an emoji is to scroll through all of them and search visually.   **Actual result:** The search tab is missing on the android app and there  is no way to search for emoji by text.  **Expected result:** I either expect there to be a search tab (like in the desktop app) or for emoji to be suggested as I type. However neither is the case.  ### Screenshots  ![1024-2048-max](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12838530/95659486-b8f7b580-0b21-11eb-8603-947b06e45d4a.png) ![Screenshot_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12838530/95659570-3d4a3880-0b22-11eb-8254-f3e3b5e673f4.png)    ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone FP3 **Android version:** 9 (/e/ version 0.11-p.2020083170821-stable-FP3 ) **Signal version:** 4.71.5 (7082)","closed","","cobordism","2020-10-10T15:59:08Z","2022-01-27T15:54:20Z"

Same happened indepedently on 2x S9 notes, and S9+ after last XEO firmware update. This CAN but DOES NOT HAVE to be connected to issue of resetting samsung battery optimization stats which are used to assign apps to buckets and killing signal in background causing lags and hot operation of phone. Reinstalling signal from scratch does not help on that particular phone that debuglogs are attached.  You can see a lot of those errors per second that makes me thing this is causing high load on cpu and slow down operation of the whole application making it unusable because of not finished jobs. ### Steps to reproduce Have the model of the phone in question, have it upraded to latest samsung firmware. Have a lot of (8000 contacts, which some contain long names and special signs). Be a member of many groups with lots of messages, lots of conversations.  **Actual result:** Signal keeps hanging probably because of battery optimizations but even when you keep in foreground it gets the phone hot probably because of processing all the contacts( big number) and hangs, also visual lags visible, contacts photos do not load, everything is super slow - signal not usable. **Expected result:** Signal does not hang.  ### Screenshots n/a   ### Device info ========= SYSINFO ========= Time         : 1600971225639 Manufacturer : samsung Model        : SM-N960F Product      : crownltexx Screen       : 1440x2792, xxxhdpi (560), 60.00 hz Font Scale   : 1.0 Android      : 10 (N960FXXS6ETHE, QP1A.190711.020.N960FXXS6ETHE) ABIs         : arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, armeabi Memory       : 56M (31.93% free, 512M max) Memclass     : 256 OS Host      : SWDH2813 Censored     : false Play Services: true FCM          : true First Version: 708 App          : Signal 4.71.5 (7082) Package      : org.thoughtcrime.securesms (doDiFGKPO1r)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/04a3609d0ad3c1abc84c8af8a7ab7fd47649e6cdaefd3b656b6ac0e438e2d573","closed","wontfix,","mattimac","2020-09-24T18:22:36Z","2022-02-03T17:52:09Z"

Consent must be a specific, freely-given, plainly-worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be ""bundled"" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely-given. (Recital 32) >  > Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. (Article 7(3)) A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. (Article 7(4)) Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old (Article 8(1)),[10] must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable (Article 8).   The GDPR states also that the data collected is subjected to a right of portability (Article 20). So a data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller.  As some of your users are european citizen, you have to comply with the GDPR  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Now user are forced to define a PIN code and personal data is then uploaded to signal server without user's consent.   The user is not able to opt-out this personal data collection made by signal.   The user can't access to its data (conversation history, etc.) without defining a PIN code. So the personal data of the user is therefore withdrawn from the user until it has given _implicit_ consent to personal data collection (by entering a PIN code).  This is clearly a violation of the GDPR.  The user don't has either the possibility to easily export his data (conversation history, etc.) to another provider.   It's also a breach of the GDPR.  **Expected result:**  Signal app and server should comply with the GDPR and thus obtain proper explicit and informed consent of their european users before collecting their personal data. The users must have the possibility to opt-out data collection if they do not consent.  The data collected should also be transferable from signal to another electronic message provider.   ### Device info all devices and os  this seem also related to bug  #9812 which has not been given proper attention","open","acknowledged,","HvB","2020-07-07T09:44:52Z","2022-04-05T19:47:34Z"

I am a user who is currently pissed about this problem, because it's fucking up me trying to talk to this girl I'm trying to date. This is not a good way to start dating someone, having a technical error that makes it so she can't see my texts I am sending and having her think I don't have interest and am ignoring her messages. And also it has been a problem in the past with other people I know who downloaded the app, only to delete it later, and being unable to contact them through texts at all. It's a bug that makes texting impossible when someone removes the app and stops using it. Not everyone wants to set the signal app as their default, and neither should they be expected to for a single or a few secured messages.   So the linked thread above says the solution is: if you hold the button it allows you to send an insecure text. I call BS as that being a solution. It is massively inconvenient to have to do that for EVERY SINGLE TEXT, not to mention it is not remotely obvious that that is even an option on the user interface of the text thread. I had no idea until I researched the problem. There needs to be a way to delete the safety number OR toggle it. Or at least toggle it while the text thread is up on the screen until you leave the screen.   I realize the very serious reasons for trying to make sure people don't accidentally send insecure texts, but you guys are fucking up my dating life with this glaring problem in the app. I have to research the solution (more time passes, she thinks I'm ignoring her), ask her to go to whisper systems website and delete the account herself for us to be able to communicate normally without secured messaging. Really awkward and makes me look bad, and first impressions are everything. I should have never asked her to download the app for a single secured communication I wanted to send.

Maybe Bidirectional is the incorrect word, but I hope you understand what I am talking about. Perhaps 4 way sync would be more correct wording. Also syncing should be full no mater what time you started the sync with the desktop. It should sync the whole chat or give option to scroll up, etc. It would seem this is all old functions, but they sure don't work good with Signal now. WhatsApp is much better with sync.

Sometimes the voice sounds robotic, sometimes the video is too blocky, sometimes either voice or video is interrupted every few seconds rednering both people unable to communicate, sometimes calls are disconnected. It is just not a very usable experience; pushing me every time to use alternative solutions such as normal calls, instagram video or facebook messenger. Every other application I have tried in similar conditions does not have the same issues or it doesn't have them as often as signal does.  I know this is not really a proper bug report just thought I would post this in case other people have similar issues or if some advice can be given so that I can resolve them since I like signal so much.  Other issues with it include:  - Video when videocalling is underexposed making it really hard to call someone in low light situations. This is not an issue when using the camera to take a photo from within signal, it is much brighter. - There no seemless transition from to wifi to cellular (4G) some times resulting in the call being disconnected  Again thanks for all your good work and hope I hear from you soon!","closed","wontfix,","giannissc","2020-08-18T17:55:45Z","2022-02-03T19:52:10Z"

(I assume its the same for windows and mac as well)  Currently: Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA Subject Public Key Algorithm: 1024-bit RSA key  My opinion: 1)This key length is too close to the most recent published successful rsa modulus factorizations. According to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_records 795 bits in 2019. The budged of the publishers is insignificant in comparision to some well known agencies. Assuming that 1024 bits are still secure is unwise.  2)regarding the use of SHA1: Google has advocated the deprecation of SHA-1 for many years. Collisions were found and forged as well. SHA1 is not a cryptographic building block. Better get rid of it immediately!  Since I deeply appreciate your work, I beg you to update your signing procedure. Publish a pgp key with at least 2k bit security and sign the ENTIRE projects sha256 hash, as its done commonly.","open","","mottla","2020-01-24T10:30:26Z","2022-06-08T12:48:09Z"

To clarify, unlike previous similar issues in github, I did not want to install Signal on a tablet as a secondary installation and companion device to the phone. This is a deliberate attempt to use the landline number as Signal's user identifier for a person who won't be able to leave her home for the coming weeks or months.  The app did not show in the Play store. Sideloading the APK worked and setup was easy, linking the landline phone number to the Signal app worked by using the voice call feature for verification number. The Corona quarantinee in my family can now do video calls with her grandkids.  Please make this easier.  - allow installation on devices without a SIM slot through the Play store - do not try to send an SMS when there is no SIM slot, but only offer the voice call verification instead - do not offer to be the default SMS app when there is no SIM slot  Thank you so much.","closed","","hzulla","2020-03-20T05:12:41Z","2020-03-22T15:29:26Z"

"","9652","Mandatory PIN screen blocks access to SMS","Hi @greyson-signal,  Thanks for your reply on #9632. Since that issue is now locked I'll fully explain my concern here.  I have several relatives who were previously using the builtin Android ""Messaging"" app for SMS. Their primary concern about installing Signal was that it would be difficult for them to manage two apps. I took advantage of the fact that Signal can seamlessly handle both insecure SMS and opportunistically encrypt messages to other Signal users. This seemed like a perfect solution.  Well no. Now I'm receiving many complaints from these relatives that their messages are locked up behind a PIN. I understand what Signal is aiming for, but the goal of usernames, groups v2, etc matter less to me than the perception of these users that Signal is no longer trustworthy.  My primary concern is that these relatives of mine believed that they had lost access to all their SMS messages and SMS contacts. The blame for this is in their mind is on both Signal and myself. At this point they just want to go back to good old SMS, which is perceived as less troublesome.  I believe I can still trust Signal to be secure and private, but for many people these factors are less important than simplicity and predictability.  I believe the PIN should be introduced the first time a user tries to use one of the new features that will require it.  In particular there should never be a requirement of entering a PIN in order to send or receive SMS messages. I also cannot think of a justification for requiring a PIN to read existing Signal messages. Perhaps you could force a PIN creation in order to send new Signal messages, do group management, or add a non-phone-number contact.  For the record I managed to convince them to stick with Signal, however the app has sadly lost a lot of good-will in the minds of many :(  Thanks for your consideration.","closed","","delxg","2020-05-23T03:10:06Z","2020-05-24T12:03:31Z"
"","9763","Signal App does not use native sampling rate of Android Device in case of USB Soundcard","Hi  My Device is a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Mobile Phone running Android 9 I suppose this works if you do not have an external Soundcard  If you use an external Soundcard the sampling rate is more randomly chosen  Usually Signal Chooses 44.1 KHz despite the fact the Android System is running on 48Khz for playback that means that Android System is able to upsample or playback the 44.1 KHz signal to 48 Khz without issues  If for Voice message recording 44.1 Khz is chosen on the external USB Soundcard there is digital noise in the recording. If sometimes, very rarely 48 Khz is chosen on the external Soundcard, Signal can record without digital noise.  For example Telegram Messenger cannot use 48 Khz at all, the voice message recording contains always digital noise.  Please could you write some code that if an external Soundcad is detected via USB for Output and Input, the sample rate should be the native sampling rate of the device, in my case that is 48 KHz, but it could be also 44.1 KHz for other devices.

Instead of using the remaining height of the device display, Signal shows a part of the previous message of the conversation. As a result, only a tiny (height-wise) portion of the device display is available for the new message, which forces the user to scroll up and down a lot.  Proposal for a possible solution: Make the window height for a new message dynamic, i.e. maximise it to use the device display height that remains (not covered by the keyboard).  Is that possible? Anyway, thanks a lot for a great messenger and for all your time you invest in this. 👍","closed","","7wells","2020-06-22T07:19:18Z","2020-06-29T14:12:41Z"

Currently, forwarding a message in Signal is a one to one relationship. Meaning, you can forward ONLY one message, to ONLY one of your contacts. However, in real life, it is oftentimes necessary to ""broadcast"" many messages to a couple of contacts. Hence, I REALLY don't see a reason, why when I select more than 1 message, the forward button just disappears !!! So, PLEASE implement a simple feature - the possibility to select several messages, then FORWARD them by clicking the button and selecting numerous contacts, to which you would like to forward the message. Several messengers have this option since quite some time, so I see no reason why THE BEST messenger app still doesn't have it !!

When sending a contact from a vcf file, a null value was loaded into the phone number field of the created contact, which caused Signal to crash when opening the app again. In versions before 4.0 of vcard, the telephone number was stored in the `text` field of the Telephone object of the used library. However, in version 4.0 of vcard, this number is stored in the `uri` field of the Telephone object (see [this Telephone object definition](https://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard/blob/master/src/main/java/ezvcard/property/Telephone.java)). This pull request modifies Signal from only checking the `text` field to first checking if this field is null and using the `uri` field if it is.   As far as I have been able to see, there is currently no chance that the `text` and `uri` field both contain (potentially conflicting) information, as the Telephone constructor sets only one field and the setters of the fields clear the other one.","closed","","martijnvandenhoek","2020-03-15T14:00:26Z","2020-04-27T14:29:40Z"

This is because in ConversationItem#setBodyText the text size will be set respecting the setting. In ConversationItem#setQuote the text size setting is ignored.   To have UI components behave in a consistent way, the QuoteItem has a new ""setTextSize"" method. This is the same as the EmojiTextView#setTextSize(int, float) that is used in  * ConversationItem bodyText * QuoteItem to display the text  Now that both UI components have a consistent way to set the used text size in respect to the user setting, ConversationItem#setQuote can now also set the users preferred text size.

"","9477","Switched to SMS, can't switch back to signal","Dear Developers!  I'm using signal on a Shift 5me smartphone without Google Apps. Installing Signal I decided to even deactivate the SMS/MMS-app from AOSP. Worked some time, but now I have this issue: Contacting a friend with Signal with a brand new smartphone and a BackUp from Signal installed, I realized that the message was sent but not recieved. Waited a few days, nothing changed. I wanted to check if my friend had a problem with Signal and switched to SMS to ask what's going on. Some days later I got the message that his smartphone running Signal had to be repaired which took some days. So, I tried to switch back to ""save messaging"" (=Signal-protocol) but the messages didn't even leave the phone. They also wouldn't if I send them in SMS-mode. So, my smartphone is now in a stage I can't send any messages to this friend. I can send Signal-messages to other people but SMS via Signal seems completely dead. No sending, at least, even using Signal to send SMS to other contacts - don't know, if receiving still works…  Sending Signal-messages through the desktop version on the other hand still works fine. For SMS I use the AOSP SMS/MMS-app, now, since I could not convince all my contacts using Signal. ;) Sending SMS with this other app works.  ### Device info **Device:** Shift 5me **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.55.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/4a5d420d577a6f93c02f9732514a7cdef049b275af97828b6dce6d35497aaa38 It took some time since the first appearance of this issue.

They won't know you've seen their message until you accept."" (instead you should be taken to the conversation screen so that you can start writing your message to that user........ ).   -Now you have to click the Pen Icon again, type the signal number in again and click new message to again in order to message them.  ### Steps to reproduce **Only happens the first time you are messaging with a signal user - 1. press pen icon from main screen - 2. type in the signal number - 3. press new message to - 4. click ""Accept"" when the ""Let [Signal Number] message you and share your name and photo with them? They won't know you've seen their message until you accept."" message appears. - after you click accept you are booted back out to the main screen instead of staying in the conversation screen where you could start typing your message...... because of the bug you are forced to repeat steps 1-3 before you can start typing your message.   **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) -You are booted back to the main signal screen  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) -You should be taken to the conversation screen so that you can write the message you wanted to send.  ### Screenshots ![Signal Photo Showing Accept Screen for Debug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73547467/97332194-67486e00-1837-11eb-96a9-5000d7715d15.jpeg)    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T387W **Android version:** 9 One UI Version 1.1 **Signal version:** 4.74.3  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/cecd73e6cffeead4229123f3380e2631135bb06f943a8270aed716ffd517f815","closed","","DougBrownVancouver","2020-10-27T16:40:03Z","2020-10-27T20:49:46Z"

These inconsistencies may have been around for awhile. Some users may have deregistered from the Signal service, one of them we have sufficient evidence that he may have deregistered. Group messages sent from active members show that different clients list the status of group messages to the potentially unregistered clients differently. Some active clients list messages as 'Sent' but others as 'Not sent'. While all show 'Not delivered'. We focused down on one known client whom we have evidence he has unregisted. Obviously these messages will not be delivered to him because he has unregistered, but what we are focusing on is the inconsistencies where clients either say group messages were 'sent' or 'not sent'. This should not be the case, all clients regardless of Android or iOS should only list these group messages under one status category. As far as we know the client cannot send one on one Signal message to an unregistered number, and will instead default to SMS, but what about group messages? We are kind of confused by this inconsistency. Group messages to unregistered numbers: Client 1- Not sent Client 2- Not sent Client 3- Sent Client 4- Sent See screenshots below  ### Screenshots  Client 1.

Update to 4.61.5 resolves the crashes.  ### Steps to reproduce - Opt-in to the Signal Beta in the Android Play store `(*)` - Enable fingerprint-based authentication `(*)` - Android silently updates to 4.59.6. - An unknown time later, Signal begins crashing (""app not responding"" error) in the background every few minutes - Attempting to open Signal in the foreground generates the same error, prior to fingerprint authentication - Force closing and rebooting the device do not help - Manually update to Signal 4.61.5 via the Google Play store. - Signal now functions normally.  `(*)` Not sure if these are necessary repro steps, but I'm including them just in case.  **Actual result:** Signal crashes with a Android OS ""not responding"" error. **Expected result:** Signal should open normally.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 10 (May 2020 update) **Signal version:** 4.59.6 -> 4.61.5  ### Link to debug log (Unable to open Signal to generate a debug log, but I did gather this using logcat via USB:  ``` 06-03 20:08:03.334  1394  3118 I ActivityTaskManager: START u0 {act=android.intent.action.MAIN cat=[android.intent.category.LAUNCHER] flg=0x10200000 cmp=org.thoughtcrime.securesms/.RoutingActivity bnds=[648,1850][864,2040]} from uid 10375 06-03 20:08:03.398  1394  1488 I ActivityManager: Start proc 18867:org.thoughtcrime.securesms/u0a217 for activity {org.thoughtcrime.securesms/org.thoughtcrime.securesms.RoutingActivity} 06-03 20:08:03.604 18867 18867 D FirebaseApp: com.google.firebase.crash.FirebaseCrash is not linked.

Usually the app deletes a couple or a handful then throws me back to the list of conversations. This has been happening for a couple of months, since I updated at the beginning of this month it is worse. Usually, if I persevere, I have been able to delete the selected messages, as interspersed with throwing me out the app occasionally does what I'm asking it to do. At the moment the app is very unreliable in this regard. [Here](https://vimeo.com/446673206) are two examples.  I think this is the relevant section from the debug log.  ![log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42522540/89851858-0a64e200-db7d-11ea-8ca1-3a1c6d71cf3d.png)   **Device:** Pixel 2 XL **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.68.4","closed","","ghost","2020-08-11T03:01:31Z","2020-08-25T11:06:00Z"

About 50% ot the time after reboot the message is not sent, but in other cases it is, seemingly at random  I'm android OS security engineer, and have never seen anything like that on prod os builds, except for proof of vulnerability apps that triggered watchdog bite or kernel panic (but even then it was not skipping encryption key boot phase). It's unlikely but possible that it's SMPL (Sudden Momentary Power Loss) issue as it's 2yo phone but that would mean that Signal is overly exhausting system resources while sending media.  Unfortunately I'm not fluent in userland apps so I was unable to debug it myself.  I'm posting issue here instead to manufacturers support page as it's only occurring while or shortly after (up to 30s) using Signal, making me assume it's not generic OS issue but somehow Signal bug or bug triggered explicitly by Signal app. Issue started appearing last week, phone was charged to at least 40% every time, it occurs both while using Wi-Fi and on mobile data. Feel free to close if debug logs do not show any clear signs of issue source or if you think it's OS bug.","closed","wontfix,","filipzarzynski","2020-11-04T21:23:43Z","2022-02-03T17:52:33Z"

(triple dots) and then it changes to ""Ringing"" (without triple dots). Triple dots indicate there is something in progress. The bug is, missing triple dots after Ringing word.  ### Steps to reproduce - On conversations list tap on specific user. - In top right tap on icon ""Signal Call"". Now first string ""Calling..."" (with triple dots) appears, then ""Ringing"" (without triple dots) appears. This is inconsistent. The bug is ""Ringing"" should be added triple dots.  **Actual result:** String ""Ringing"" without triple dots. **Expected result:** There should be string ""Ringing...""  ### Screenshots ![pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10895030/89212228-677ff700-d5c3-11ea-9b17-37ae416acc97.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung S10 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.67.3  ### Link to debug log It is visual problem, so debug log is not needed.  Just make sure, fix for this problem is added at the beginning of beta program, because translators probably need to translate this new triple dot string.","closed","","igor2x","2020-08-03T17:58:24Z","2020-08-24T19:57:39Z"

Notice that the last second of the voice note gets cut off by the ding  **Expected result:** The whole voice note should play, *then* the ding should play.  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus 7 Pro **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.78.2  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/a9799729acefdb4fda64ca0610f70d3c8bbe65bab36060cb2f5588e5b99dadc5","closed","wontfix,","robotwombat","2020-11-20T15:45:41Z","2022-02-02T11:59:00Z"

One thing I've noticed recently is that on my phone that I regularly use for Signal, there's a bit of a delay where it takes the app a second or two to load all of my conversations. During this period, for a split second, the empty state is displayed until is is quickly replaced with the list of conversations.  ### Steps to reproduce I'm unable to reproduce this in an Android Emulator, I suspect that maybe this is because I have a lot of conversation data on my primary device.   **Actual result:** Empty state is displayed, then is quickly replaced with my conversations  **Expected result:** I would expect a blank screen to be displayed while it is unknown whether or not I have conversations, and once that is determined either my conversations or the empty state.  ### Screenshots  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22125581/85969945-17e05700-b997-11ea-907e-9d23ad3c8de2.png)   ### Device info **Signal version:** 4.64.7","closed","","bitmold","2020-06-29T04:19:25Z","2020-07-30T13:08:46Z"

As an example: Yesterday, one message of a group chat of mine wasn't delivered to one of the participants and isn't until now (for whatever reason, but this is a problem of it's own, as e. g. already filed in Bug #9580 … all following messages were delivered normally), but the message's status is displayed as ""delivered"".  ### Steps to reproduce Chat in a group chat until the problem hits you that one participant doesn't receive a message.  **Actual result:** The Message is marked as ""delivered""  **Expected result:** it shouldn't be ;-)  ### Screenshots Here's a screenshot of the chat, the message is marked both as ""sent"" and ""delivered"": ![Screenshot_20200618-123458](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6770781/85014331-5a6b8d80-b166-11ea-95be-6ae05adaf4eb.png)  And here's a screenshot of the message info, notice the one participant that didn't receive the message: ![Screenshot_20200618-123518](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6770781/85014420-871fa500-b166-11ea-90b0-2921df570712.png)  ### Device info **Device:** Nokia 4.2 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.63.3  ### Proposed solution Apart from fixing the issue that sometimes, not all group members receive a message, I would propopse some progress indicator for the ""delivered"" tick (maybe also for the ""sent"" one):  One could e. g. add some ""1/6"", ""2/6"" and so on beside the respective tick and remove it if all is done, or – more sophisticated and unobtrusive – a circled progress bar around the tick displayed in red as long as not all messages have been sent/received and a green complete circle if all is done. For the ""read"" notification, I would propose to introduce a third tick for group chats.  The data is already there, one can see this in the message details. But it should be displayed in the chat window, so that one actually knows if everything is okay with a message. As of now, one would have to check the message details of each and every message for this information.","closed","","l3u","2020-06-18T11:30:01Z","2020-06-18T14:03:56Z"

But I get the read receipt of my message only about 10-30 seconds after he already answered my message if we continue chatting. Another Problem is, if he doesn't answer and he exits the conversation, the conversation is highlighted, like the message was not read before. If he re-enters it the read receipts is send.  ### Steps to reproduce - Phone A: Be in one conversation, scrolled to the bottom - Phone B: Send message - Phone A: Exit conversation - Phone A: Re-Enter conversation  **Actual result:** It only sends the read receipt after you close and re-enter the conversation or if you keep chatting **Expected result:** It should always send a read receipt if you are in the Conversation screen  ### Device info Phone A: **Device:** Nokia 7.2 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.70.5  Phone B: **Device:** Asus Zenfone 6 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.70.5  ### Link to debug log Phone A: https://debuglogs.org/d170ba473c6d454a0cf95efb46fe792ad5b8330a083a1971b7fc0aa0c383b6ab  Phone B: https://debuglogs.org/fe2b71f10d6066debe469e1e3504ec154781f9dba8c0200f4f1b358e7df50cfb","closed","","Nisc3d","2020-09-14T12:25:33Z","2020-09-23T21:10:25Z"

(The message itself is not selected anymore)  ### Steps to reproduce - Mark message in chat - Choose an action from the top menu   **Actual result:** Menu closes, message is not marked anymore.  **Expected result:** There should be an information when I click on info; there should be a dialog to whom I like to forward the message; or the message should be deleted when I click on delete etc.  ### Screenshots  ### Device info **Device:** Nokia 8.1 (TA-1119) **Android version:** 10 (incl. security updates 1.02.2020) **Signal version:** 4.56.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/f6cdc9a5a1f312de6d3acbacc43ba7bd3059b576164ac6852223ac15c49d1aca","closed","","patterchon","2020-03-06T14:44:47Z","2020-09-21T15:15:18Z"

(#4190, which is noted as fixed in [d7e4928](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/d7e4928f22e0a0e123eadd7442c32296b6eb6fad)) (#9002 seems to be a PR that apparently implements features that could fix this issue, but it was closed due to an [issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1943) that has later been resolved)  ### Screenshots ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5272077/96366124-cb877580-1145-11eb-882e-68978dc937b7.png)   ### Device info **Device:** Desktop App **Signal version:** v1.37.1  ### Link to debug log Nothing in the logs can shed light on this issue.","closed","","Swoy","2020-10-18T11:47:09Z","2022-04-22T09:56:02Z"

Since Signal 4.58.5, the blue circle closes immediately and in about 95% of all attempts the small dotted circle keeps spinning forever, only about 5% of all attempts succeed. If it's stuck, subsequent messages do not get transferred either, not even single character text messages. Sending the debug log is an ordeal because most attempts fail too. I still can receive messages though while having a stuck outgoing message. The only way to get rid of this situation is to select the stuck message(s) and hit delete. Maybe it has something to do with the wifi but my flat mates do not have the issue (tested with mobile data disabled).  Maybe related: #8604.  ### Steps to reproduce - take a photo within Signal or pick a photo or screenshot from the gallery - try to send it  **Actual result:** Signal sits there and claims to be busy but nothing happens **Expected result:** Signal uploads the photo steadily until it succeeds  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola One Vision **Android version:** 10 **Signal versions:** {4.58.5, 4.59.8}","closed","wontfix,","mijwnuaowsdgmmdk","2020-04-06T20:02:06Z","2022-04-09T00:58:47Z"

I’d like to use the same setup to make/take outgoing/incoming calls.  Similar use case : your headphones don’t have a microphone (or it’s broken). You want to keep hearing though them while speaking into the (speaker)phone.  This issue is similar to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/6918 except that it applies to all calls, not only video ones.  ### Steps to reproduce - Plug a no-mic headset into you phone - Make or receive a call - You can hear the other party just fine through the headset - The other party complains about hearing you faintly or not at all - By activating the speakerphone, you’ll be heard clearly, but now the sound will come out of the speaker and no longer from the headset  **Actual result:** your voice is either not heard, or faintly. You can hear fine through the headset. **Expected result:** your voice should go through the speakerphone WHILE still hearing through the headset  ### Screenshots N/A   ### Device info **Device:** LG G4 H815 **Android version:** Android 9 **Signal version:** 4.73.4  ### Link to debug log No debug log at the moment, will provide if needed.","closed","wontfix,","breversa","2020-10-22T09:55:45Z","2022-04-06T20:32:16Z"

I kept manually retrying and it didn't work until I went outside. It's possible that, despite what my phone (Moto Z Play, Android 8.0) showed, the reception wasn't good enough to send it, since it wasn't using data, as it would be if sending to another Signal user. However, it would have been nice if a) it alerted me to the failure (I only knew because I checked), told me the reason, and retried on its own (or maybe it was but didn't give any indication). A while back, one of the updates claimed a big improvement to send failures and that they should be eliminated (or retried until success or something along those lines), but since then I've experienced issues like this multiple times.    ### Steps to reproduce - Send MMS (image, etc) to non-Signal user, probably while in a weak-signal area - Watch as sending fails with no further action or indication of anything  **Actual result:** Image sending fails. **Expected result:** Signal should keep trying (or if it is, show that) as well as give an indication as to why it failed  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Moto Z Play **Android version:** 8.0 **Signal version:** 5.0.5  ### Link to debug log   This was a couple days ago and is already outside of the log timeframe. Considering I don't text a lot, it seems it doesn't keep a very long log. If there were at least an option to periodically append log entries to a file, so I could keep a long-term log on the SD card, I could have found it, as well as possibly entries for other issues I've had. Also, Signal crashed while viewing the log, ironically, and I was going to submit the log for that, but I'm not going to spend an hour scrolling through it on a small screen to ensure it doesn't contain any private info, especially when scrolling around causes the text to flutter, which I can see giving me a headache. And it can't be copied to view elsewhere and ""editing"" involves laboriously deleting one line at a time.","closed","wontfix,","vertigo220","2020-12-16T22:28:52Z","2022-02-02T15:35:54Z"

While in a Signal audio call, suddenly the call ends. On my side I hear the normal hang up sound, on the other side it appears as if no more sound is coming from me. When then calling again, the other side can hear me talking, but I hear no sound from the other side. This was tried several times.  I could register and send a voice message to the other side, and it could be heard by them. The other side could not register a voice message and also had trouble connecting to other Signal contacts.  Web connectivity works on both sides (checked with a web page).  In this particular instance, the drop happened when I changed the camera on my side, but on other occasions no special action happened at the time of dropping.  Call dropping with this particular contact happens so frequently that it has become a major issue for using Signal,  ### Steps to reproduce No recipe to reproduce. It happens since several months on most calls with this contact, after roughly 5 to 15 minutes. The above mentioned audio problem does not always occur for subsequent calls.  ### Device info I believe contained in the debug logs.  ### Link to debug log My side: https://debuglogs.org/f4b520155e07671c3a893af28c907f9e6d01da09744d0ddeef26977321acbe06 Other side: https://debuglogs.org/fce6ba6c5284b7cff7a6b618eb47715ade107ad742f234d41115448bda4d4582  Call hang-up occurred between about 6:35PM and 6:40PM.","closed","wontfix,","sirius-c","2020-06-21T17:56:21Z","2022-02-03T22:40:56Z"

Either that's gone or it's super hard to find because I've been hunting around and I can't find it.   Same for an existing contact: there used to be a way to get to the ""Contact"" screen from Signal. Appears to be gone.   There **definitely** used to be a way to do this. If it's gone it should be brought back.   ### Steps to reproduce - Get a text from a new number - long press on the message, no way to create a new contact - go to the Signal settings for that contact/conversation, no way to create a new contact  **Actual result:** no way to create a new contact  **Expected result:** A button of some sort that will take you to the new contact screen in the Android phonebook. Or a button that takes you to the existing contact.   ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 3XL **Android version:** 10  **Signal version:** 4.59.10","closed","","jcollum","2020-05-19T19:22:25Z","2020-05-28T16:57:17Z"

On *newly* linked devices, these contacts appear as numbers only. This falls together with the reappearance of long deleted groups and conversations *on newly linked devices*, both iPadOS client and desktop.     **Expected result:** Gone, what I want gone: Contacts, groups, conversations.   ### Device info **Signal version:** 4.65.2","closed","wontfix,","jos128","2020-07-14T20:23:17Z","2022-02-02T02:05:31Z"

Try to pick a word that would show different contacts in the search result to avoid having the same contact fill the whole screen (""link"", ""phone"" are common enough but not used multiple times in (my) conversations like ""the"", ""like"") - Click on a conversation. Try to pick one in the middle of the list or one sandwiched between different contacts (not between conversations with the same name/icon) - Go back to the search results  **Actual result:** The conversations glitch unpredictably and the names/icons of the conversations are switched around seemingly randomly. The highlighted excerpts from messages and their respective dates/times are kept in order. When you click on a conversation (after the first time) you go to the ""correct"" chat with the right contact and respective icon, which might not match the name you clicked on from the search result.  **Expected result:** The contacts displayed match the conversations.

However, not everyone (regardless of gender) has hair, be it for personal preference, genetic, age, health or whatever reasons. Some health reasons are also temporary, in which case it might not be helpful/nice/empathic to send the person a reminder of what is missing or how that person ""should"" look.  Similarly, grey hair variants are missing entirely, although a large part of the world population, most notably elderly people, actually has grey hair. Most of the professions represented in the set of emojis do not prevent elderly people from doing them, but the set of emoji variants excludes them visibly.  I personally find it sad that a set of emoji variants that explicitly and clearly strives for inclusion in fact excludes so many people.","closed","","scoder","2020-06-24T18:29:02Z","2020-06-25T04:47:40Z"

This is either an application issue or a doc issue, as your [documentation](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007459591) says we still have a choice. The previous obscure ways I knew to bypass this, quitting the app or using a back button, no longer work - they all exit the app, and the impassible profile demand is shown again on the next app launch.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open app  Tested methods: - App drawer icon - Notification - A variety of Signal app activities, via Nova Launcher shortcuts  **Actual result:** The profile creation view appears. Clearing the First Name field disables the Next button. The Android back button and Signal back button both exit the application, and re-launching it returns to profile creation. There is no ""Skip"" button. **Expected result:** The chat list appears, since this isn't the first launch. At minimum, profile creation can be bypassed. An intuitive way would be ideal, but the previous back button or quit methods are tolerable.  ### Screenshots I'm unable to take a screenshot because of my application configuration. I'm unable to modify my application configuration because it's demanding I create a profile first. Ignoring my desire to never do that, creating a profile would make it difficult to reproduce the bug. Is there a way to delete a profile after it's created?  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 10, 5 Apr patch (QQ2A.200405.005) and 5 May patch (QQ2A.200501.001.B2) **Signal version:** 4.59.8 and 4.59.9  ### App state - Signal had previously been registered and used successfully - Registration lock enabled - Default SMS app, which makes this particularly annoying - Fingerprint auth required - Clear cache -> no change - Force quit / reboot -> no change  ### Link to debug log I'm unable to capture an application debug log because I'm unable to access Signal settings. Attempting to capture a debug log from the fingerprint prompt results in the fingerprint icon shaking angrily and no information being provided.

Also, it looks like an unnamed file with "".*"" as file type.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Take a picture with the camera app on Huawei P20 Pro. Here's an example you can download and send: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7i54fsxzw797yua/2020-02-22%2023.00.07.jpg?dl=0 2. Send it in Signal-Android. Sending it in Signal-Desktop seems to work fine, which is why I think this is a Signal-Android issue and not a Signal-Desktop issue. 3. Try to save it on the receiving end, in my case, Google Pixel 3a XL. Nothing is saved. 4. Look at the picture on Signal-Desktop. It should look like the picture attached below. 5. If you save the picture on Signal-Desktop (the latest beta), it works fine, but you have to choose your own file type as the file type is "".*"" by default.  **Actual result:** The image doesn't seem to be converted properly... maybe? **Expected result:** The image works fine, as it did just a few days ago  ### Screenshots  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12563436/75100105-d21b1880-55c9-11ea-8be2-93bc6d83c47b.png)    ### Device info Time         : 1582409742866 Device       : HUAWEI CLT-L29 (CLT-L29) Android      : 9 (9.1.0.380C432, CLT-L29 9.1.0.380(C432E8R1P11)) ABIs         : arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, armeabi Memory       : 63M (36.13% free, 512M max) Memclass     : 384 OS Host      : cn-central-1b-9b39abfb61577946835141-3505357959-n3j1q Refresh Rate : 60.00 hz Average FPS  : 59.60 First Version: 552 App          : 4.56.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/7a2c440fa9cef476bc663b627bf340ea6c994880c7d98201e4ea9784fbec2bb6","closed","","Dyras","2020-02-22T22:22:04Z","2020-02-26T21:07:12Z"

The caller can continuously observe that Signal tries to connect but it won't succeed in the end.  The issue is the silent failure. A user cannot be expected to figure out that their call failed because of some minute deviance from atomic clock.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have two phones with their clock set some minutes off in both directions. - Try to call each other.  **Actual result:** Signal is just trying to connect but after a minute of trying the other party receives a chat message that they had a missed call. **Expected result:** Signal warns the users that establishing this call is not possible because of the drifted time.  ### Device info Device independent based on previous comments.

Clicking on the photo to view within the app loads the viewer but the image is completely black.  Attempting to download the image results in error message: ""Error while saving attachment to storage!""  **Expected result:**   Image is received in Signal, rendered in the chat, and rendered as full size in the viewer.

It's not so much about wasted space, as an attempt to guarantee that deleted messages are really unrecoverable, and what else we need to do to ensure this if no such guarantee can be made.  There are times, particularly when crossing from one territory into another, that people may be forced to unlock their phones for dumping by the authorities, so threads need to be deleted ahead of time and rendered permanently unrecoverable on the device. (A really smart border agent might force you to open all your devices, hoping to obtain duplicates of the deleted threads on your linked device, which is why devices need to be unlinked prior to the privacy invasion, but that's another matter.) It's critical that deleted threads never be recoverable even by direct dumping of the media, and even if the phone has been unlocked. On the other hand, it's equally critical that the association between a given Signal installation and the phone number used to register it remain intact across any process which destroys those deleted threads, mainly because it makes good security sense to register with a disposable SIM unrelated to the phone's actual SIM.  Now, the bug:  After building up hundreds of MB of chats including shared media, I deleted all my threads. None were archived. However, Signal's app info in the phone setup still shows that it's consuming enough space to still be storing them somewhere. I assume they're encrypted, but that's not necessarily good enough, which I'll get to below.  Of course, I could just clear the cache, but that would create another serious problem, which is that it would force me to reregister my Signal phone number. Why this has to occur just in order to clear the cache makes no sense to me; the two items just seemed to have been lumped together unnecessarily.  ### Steps to reproduce  - Make a bunch of threads with messaging peers. They must be big enough so that they are many times the base install size of Signal. Therefore it will be obvious when the storage footprint is due to their associated allocations, as opposed to just Signal's executable code.  - Take note of Signal's storage footprint in the phone's app settings.  - Delete all the threads, one by one. You can even reboot the phone just to -- hopefully -- flush the deallocated space.  - Go back to the phone's app settings and look at Signal's footprint size once again.  **Actual result:** The footprint has hardly changed. You can only change it by flushing Signal's cache, which leads to the problem mentioned above.  **Expected result:** **Option 1** Deleting messages, or entire message threads, doesn't free up space, but it deletes the unique-per-message crypto keys used to allow them to be decrypted, so anyone dumping the phone storage won't see any zeroed-out gaps between messages which might allow accurate message sizes to be determined. (I'm assuming some crude object store like: key hash 0, message 0, key hash 1, message 1, etc., out of total ignorance, but the point is that keys should not be zeroed out in order to delete messages; they should be filled with noise because while having one message size is probably useless, having a lot of them, even granularized, is potentially useful for various identification purposes.) To put it another way, I assume that each received message is locally stored and encrypted with a unique and randomly generated key, which just needs to be overwritten with noise upon deletion, so that the deleted message can never be recovered, even though it is still theoretically decryptable. (If this is not the case, then please explain what actually happens. Is there a per-thread key instead? A per-installation key? Or what? Per-thread would mean that we're only safe if we delete whole threads, for instance.) Now, in order to actually free the deallocated space, the user must visit the app's storage menu in the phone's settings: ""Clear Cache"" clears all data _except_ the association between the Signal installation and a particular phone number. This allows users to maintain that association long after the registering SIM has been trashed. ""Clear Data"" clears that assocation also, and potentially other user preferences, leaving a situation indistinct from a fresh install.  **Option 2** ""Clear Cache"" kills the phone number association, so in order to avoid that, the user will need to delete one thread at a time. After deleting (deallocating) them, garbage collection happens at some point, hopefully before the phone is rebooted. In any event, after the reboot, all the space previously allocated to deleted threads has been relinquished to the phone's storage pool. (""Clear Data"" performs as in Option 1.)  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung S20 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** (latest as of this report)","closed","wontfix,","sailbird","2020-11-09T03:41:39Z","2022-02-02T17:36:14Z"

Creating a PIN is highly inconvenient, especially if you're trying to get your friends and family on Signal and makes it more difficult for them to remember, and overall this decreases the privacy and security of users. Signal should revert to how it was just a few months ago, when it didn't require a PIN.  This may be by design, but if so, it is a poor design decision that should be reconsidered and considered a bug.  ### Steps to reproduce - Use Signal without a PIN  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Signal requires you to create a PIN, before you can access your messages. (Also, this is a [violation of GDPR](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9828))  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Creating a PIN should be optional.","closed","","ML-Chen","2020-07-14T21:03:18Z","2020-08-10T16:20:53Z"

And Signal shows truncated names all of a sudden.  Also, when you exported contacts a while ago, it may happen you change the name of one of your contacts using the usual android ways. With a usual setup, thats a local phonebook or a google addressbook. Whatever. Name is changed. Default Android Contact app shows changed name.  Signal won't. Ever. It uses the (possibly truncated or by now just wrong) name from the SMS.  Android also allows you to select ""Which contacts to display"" (in contacts app settings, slightly different where exactly, depending on the app) and about all of Android then follows this. Say, you select Google and Phone Contacts only, disabling SMS. You wont see the SMS stored ones - except in Signal.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) Follow the same as the rest, honor the ""addressbooks to display"". Wherever that setting ends up, it appears to be central (using multiple different dialers, they all follow what any of them set). Or add an own option that lets one disable some sources for contacts.  ### Device info **Signal version:** According to play store, 4.53.6 from 13.

Once that long message is in your Signal history, Signal is permanently laggy every time you use it from that time forward and forever onward.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Forward an email to your phone. I do this all the time via automatic filters to help notify me of things, since emails get cluttered easy but texts stand out to me more.  1. For Verizon, for instance, this is easily done by forwarding the email to `9998887777@vzwpix.com`, where `999-888-7777` is your phone number.  1. Now, the email will show up as an html blob in your Signal SMS text messages. Other text messaging systems handle this just fine, but Signal gets suuuuuuuper slow and laggy once it receives even one of these!  **Actual result:**   - Signal takes 5 to 10+ seconds to scroll once the message thread containing the long message is in view.  - It takes 5 to 10+ seconds to open that message. - It takes 5 to 10+ seconds to re-display your list of message threads once you go back from this message. - Summary: it is unusuably slow. I will have to get rid of Signal if this can't be fixed soon. :( Signal is unusable. This isn't an occasional bug, this is **every time I open up or use the app _at all_**.  **Expected result:**  It should continue working normally, and NOT be slow.   ### Screenshots  None.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 2 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.68.8  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/730af2539433b1ed0bb22c6c748bf69d0e7654cc90f27b422dcaee83701c12a0  Here are some parts of the log that look relevant at a quick glance:  1.

Then, thinking it might be a problem with that particular message, I went to note-to-self and recorded an audio message to myself. As soon as I let go of the record button (when the newly recorded audio message is given a message bubble), the app crashes. After restarting, the app crashes as soon as I try to enter the note-to-self thread.  ### Device info **Device:** ZTE Z981 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.61.0  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/3a2e0945e6f3c7cc11a0ea79958996c5bbdcfdf0002b3e9fbd3780dba901f38a  On my other beta phone (a Sony Xperia Z5C, with android 7.1.1), everything seems to work fine by the way.","closed","","bepaald","2020-05-30T23:31:24Z","2020-06-03T13:16:22Z"

The GIF showed up properly as an attached image, and I typed the message text, but upon pressing the send button, the activity crashed, and I was returned to the conversation without the message being sent, and the GIF and text were lost.  Oddly, after multiple attempts and crashes, I was finally able to send the intended message and I cannot seem to reproduce it now, but you can clearly see the errors in the debug log.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Open conversation 2. Use Gboard's GIF search to add GIF to message 3. Enter text in the regular message text area 4. Press send  **Actual result:** Signal partially crashes -- the screen goes white for a second, then you are returned to the conversation with no attached image, no message text, and the message has not been sent. **Expected result:** GIF + text message sends normally  ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 2 XL **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.66.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/6f352ec43f9ba8929871123e5beed8ed81cfde9e927ae98da5b4ab17cbfe3219","closed","wontfix,","Herohtar","2020-07-17T02:42:18Z","2022-01-28T17:35:27Z"

This issue seemed to be starting without any interaction, although it is hard to determine at what point exactly messages were no longer received.  Upon further investigation it appears a `PushDecryptMessageJob` with an invalid message ID was added into the JobManager queue, or the message was deleted before the job was run. Since the number of attempts is unlimited (`Lifespan: Immortal, Run Attempt: 1/Unlimited`), the job is retried infinitely and no other jobs are run. This means no new messages are received.  ### Steps to reproduce - I am unable to reproduce this bug  **Expected result:** A failing task in the JobManager (or the PushDecryptMessageJob more specifically) should be handled gracefully and not block the JobManager queue indefinitely. (regardless of how the task ended up in the queue in the first place)  ### Device info **Device:** Xiaomi Mi A1 (lineage_tissot) **Android:** 9 (3a48e991c4, lineage_tissot-userdebug 9 PQ3A.190801.002 3a48e991c4 dev-keys) **ABIs:** arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, armeabi **Memory:** 32M (12.31% free, 512M max) **Memclass:** 256 **OS Host:** 153a1007870a **First Version:** 560 **App:** Signal 4.56.4 (6102)  No google play services are installed on the device and the push notifications are delivered through the background connection.

Initially, Signal notifications are outputting properly at FitBit Charge 3 following a clean install of the Signal app for approximately 5 minutes.  About 5 minutes after initial Signal app install, Signal notifications are no longer outputting at FitBit Charge 3, although the Signal notifications are properly outputting at the Pixel 4 itself.  The FitBit charge 3 properly outputs notifications from all messaging apps (e.g., Messenger, WhatsApp) except Signal.  If I select ""Clear Storage"" for the Signal app in Android settings, and then re-enter my user credentials, the Signal notifications begin outputting properly again at the FitBit Charge 3 for about 5 minutes after which the Signal notifications stop working.  ### Steps to reproduce - Clean install of Android 10 on Pixel 4. - Install FitBit app and Signal app - Configure FitBit app to output Signal notifications at the Charge 3 - Receive initial Signal message, which causes notification at Pixel 4 and notification is properly output at Charge 3. - Wait approximately 5 minutes - Receive subsequent Signal message, which causes notification at Pixel 4 BUT no notification is output at Charge 3.  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) After receipt of Signal message at Pixel 4, no notification is occurring at FitBit Charge 3.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) After receipt of Signal message at Pixel 4, notification should occur at FitBit Charge 3.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 4 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.54.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/039ef189548ccf61ad43742477133c2cdcfa883329b17fc897b3a0d07fd7b5be","closed","wontfix,","chriskarlen","2020-02-01T16:58:43Z","2022-02-04T02:03:56Z"

Then my connected desktop overtakes my phone, shows a single tick and a double tick while the phone is still displaying the loading icon. It seems like every single message action is 3-4 seconds delayed and those delays *add up*. (I included a video further down)  Sometimes it is so bad, that I can effectively no longer text on my phone -- waiting a minute for every message to send just makes for a very frustrating experience.  This conversation also takes a few seconds to initially display anything besides a blank screen.  All other conversations (which are *a lot* smaller) work normally.  ### My limited debugging Watching the logcat output in android studio, I noticed an interesting pattern: ``` 2020-07-28 10:13:45.549 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 2115 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 2020-07-28 10:13:51.314 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 5460 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 -- invalidated 2020-07-28 10:13:53.097 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 1780 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 2020-07-28 10:13:55.321 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 1790 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 2020-07-28 10:14:00.643 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 3086 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 -- invalidated 2020-07-28 10:14:02.816 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 2167 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 2020-07-28 10:14:08.896 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 6070 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 2020-07-28 10:14:12.793 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 1688 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 2020-07-28 10:14:16.753 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 2009 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 -- invalidated 2020-07-28 10:14:20.181 30461-30948/org.thoughtcrime.securesms D/ConversationDataSource: [Initial Load] 3422 ms | thread: 9, start: 0, size: 50 ``` Each load from the `ConversationDataSource` takes 2-6 seconds in the slow conversation but just a couple milliseconds in the fast ones. Additionally, each time a (not invalidated) ""Initial load"" line is printed, another message shows up in my signal client. The time between the messages in the log quite closely matches the time they say they took.  Based on that it feels like signal queues up the inserts somehow, waits for the load to finish and then commits the next message. Something along those lines would also explain the ""falling behind"". If I write a few messages, signal needs to wait for `~3s * message count` until it reaches the up-to-date position again.  I have never looked at the signal code much more than needed to figure out what that method is doing, so that is completely baseless speculation.  ### Further information I am currently running a self-compiled version of signal (4.66.4 tag) to debug this so I could measure and adjust the code as you see fit.  ### Another maybe interesting observation Last night my phone was a whole day behind (probably unrelated syncing problems) and I opened the signal client. This prompted signal to slowly display the messages over the next minutes, but I gave up quite quickly and put the phone in airplane mode. The next morning, *all my messages were displayed correctly*. Apparently Signal was able to process and display them and *that* is what took time. All messages were already received, otherwise they would have been missing as airplane mode does not allow any data connection.  ### Steps to reproduce - have a very large conversation with images and files and lots of messages - open the conversation and wait a few seconds for anything to appear - write a message and watch it not being send or registered for a few seconds - write a message on your connected desktop or ask the other party and notice a few seconds delay - just spam a few messages and watch the phone *hopelessly* fall behind  **Actual result:** The phone hopelessly falls behind in the conversation **Expected result:** The phone should show me the messages in a timely manner  ### Screenshots Won't really help, I think. But here is a video. All messages were sent in rapid succession (maybe a second total) and appeared in a similar timeframe on the connected desktop where they were written. https://imgur.com/gYfcWv9   ### Device info **Device:** Fairphone 2 **Android version:** 8.1.0 **Signal version:** Tag 4.66.4, but also happens with the newest playstore version and every other version I tried in the last year or so. The problem just got progressively worse over time probably because the conversation grew.  ### Link to debug log [Log](https://debuglogs.org/d270228fc66384bfa42bc387a3c97dc522db7e7dc5ed5f11cf2eb2173b79c010)","closed","wontfix,","I-Al-Istannen","2020-07-28T09:00:35Z","2022-02-02T19:17:45Z"

If you watch the same video on your gallery, it will be perfect.  **Actual result:**  Very low frame rate, pixelated and high contrast.  **Expected result:** See the video just as you see in your gallery.  ### Screenshots Signal: ![Screenshot_20200503-181413](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18470550/80920842-52988b00-8d6a-11ea-83a6-2bd6edc555fb.jpg)  Gallery: ![Screenshot_20200503-181434](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18470550/80920846-57f5d580-8d6a-11ea-9f1a-fb67c65c29cb.jpg)   ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus6 (8GB) **Android version:** 10 (OxygenOS 10.3.3) **Signal version:** 4.59.6 (this problem only appeared a few weeks ago, before that was ok)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/205d99bf078fdcf88a7ed05a2984b386920f0064fff34ab71345a106aa79ae7f","closed","wontfix,","diogodh","2020-05-03T17:18:49Z","2022-02-04T03:51:09Z"

The thumbnail will stay like this forever. I cannot find a way to update/recalculate the thumbnail.  The image itself is fine, if enlarged full screen. It will get a proper thumbnail on occasion in the ""all media"" folder, though that gallerie produces quite a few blurred images if scrolling back and forth, but usually different images are blurred and they are either blurred completely or show completely.  The desktop app and the receiving phone both also displayed a proper thumbnail.  ### Steps to reproduce - take a single picture / or share one picture from the gallery app - type a caption under the preview of the image (still fine) - send the image - an animation symbolized the sending progress - the image is stuck with a bad thumbnail - no way to recalculate the broken thumbnail  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20200920-100929](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7427503/93707301-95da7700-fb1c-11ea-9063-ada4595a1f18.jpg) ![Screenshot_20200920-100738](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7427503/93707318-b1de1880-fb1c-11ea-842d-45f2b82bb6c5.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** OnePlus Nord **Android version:** OxygenOS 10.5.7.AC01BA **Signal version:** 4.71.5","closed","","hklene","2020-09-20T08:43:17Z","2020-09-20T13:50:26Z"

But this does not work the same when I receive a new ""**reaction** emoji"" notification.

The size of the backup is 6453327474 bytes. The size used by Signal on the original device according to Android is 7.38 GB, storage used on the original device is displayed as 5.9 GB. The size used on the new device is 12.94 GB and the storage used is reported in Signal as 6.4 GB. Given the opacity of Android's calculation of used storage I am not certain to what degree this is accurate.  ### Steps to reproduce - Make backup - Transfer backup to new phone - Disable and delete backups on both devices - Compare space used on internal storage on both devices  **Actual result:** The new device on which the backup was restored appears to be using roughly twice the storage of the original instance as per Android's storage settings but about 500 MB more according to Signal's internal storage calculation. **Expected result:** Both devices should show the same amount of space being used immediately after the backup is restored.  ### Screenshots  Original device: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/88093881-8ecdd180-cb8a-11ea-9158-1d647d2034bb.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/88093904-98573980-cb8a-11ea-8df2-2dd0365fdfa4.png) New device: ![signal-2020-07-21-192947_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/88094010-be7cd980-cb8a-11ea-8c21-206809ead589.png) ![signal-2020-07-21-192947_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/88094014-c0df3380-cb8a-11ea-9168-bf53b8c24b44.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 XL **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.66.8  ### Link to debug log  I was not able to capture a debug log immediately after the backup was restored.","closed","wontfix,","mmirg","2020-07-21T18:46:54Z","2022-02-03T23:41:11Z"

Previews show error image, and opened pictures are just entirely black. I can however save such 'broken' file into gallery and other apps display it without any problem, even if Signal Android still shows only black preview.  I also tried to sent those 'broken' files as Note to self and Desktop App shows them just fine, except 2 files that were delivered with extension '.x-ms-bmp' instead of '.bmp'.  Anyway, I've done some tests and it seems that this problem shows up only for bmp images with 24 bit depth (8 bit per channel) and resolution 1600x1200px or very similar (it also occurred for 1610x1208, and 1590x1193, but I didn't encounter it for much smaller or bigger resolutions like 1500x1125, and 1800x1351px).  ### Steps to reproduce - create 24 bit bmp file with resolution 1600x1200px - send it to some contact or as a 'Note to self' on Android app  **Actual result:** Image isn't displayed properly on Signal Android. **Expected result:** Image is displayed properly.  ### Screenshots  The same 24 bit, 1600x1200px test file as jpg and bmp. ![signal-BMP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28538453/93233239-5f8ea780-f76a-11ea-9447-bee2838f20fc.png)  Broken bmp previews. ![signal-BMPGallery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28538453/93234039-54884700-f76b-11ea-9b1a-b3df2776076c.jpeg)  ![signal-BMPPreview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28538453/93234666-163f5780-f76c-11ea-8c19-f3b11ab7368b.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** LG G4 **Android version:** 6.0 **Signal version:** 4.71.5 and older  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/794349e0664a0524b25c709e41086a1f0befa0e45b65ec79c912e01e0b3c4e9e","closed","wontfix,","DirkPitt1","2020-09-15T16:05:36Z","2022-02-03T17:52:05Z"

The quoted message reveals the quoted user's phone number and the beginning of their message to the recipient.  **Expected result:** The message should not have a quoted reply attached to it.  _(Edit: completed the steps, thanks @RaghavRao)_  ### Screenshots  #### My Device ![local-end](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1972632/76694136-4460a500-662c-11ea-920b-bef5964d5876.png)  #### Other Device ![remote-end](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1972632/76694141-5c382900-662c-11ea-8a73-bf7a133d484a.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S8 **Android version:** 9.0 **Signal version:** 4.57.1  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/29e62540ef8d5436cd583f558d3ad243706e8aed0483429eb3e9a0a5ef1069fe  ### Notes This behaviour appears to be somewhat similar to #7935 (different steps, same result).","closed","","jonpavelich","2020-03-15T03:03:50Z","2020-03-26T21:52:44Z"
"","9702","Push notifications / Play Services detection with microG broken since face blur update","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description Push notifications when using microG in place of Google's Play Services, which was working perfectly previously, is now broken since the face blur update. I believe this is due to the addition and/or update of relevant Google Firebase libraries, for example https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/c8dd4e5254c0771b2a1925df408ed9d360c68f84#diff-39e7d8c00954e920b98e7636f0ac30b2R287. It's possible that the upgrade or addition of the ML libraries changed the higher level detection of Play Services to return an error, or a ""needs update"" status or similar, breaking push notification functionality where it was previously known to work well.  I realise microG isn't an official development target of yours at all, however given that Signal likely attracts a disproportionate number of microG users relative to other projects, if it turns out to be relatively low lift to roll-back or otherwise rework the capability detection, perhaps a fix for this can be considered.  ### Steps to reproduce - Set up a phone with a working install of microG, showing as connected in the Google Cloud Messaging menu. - Install the latest Signal release.  **Actual result:** Play Services detection fails and the app falls back to the much less efficient polling service. **Expected result:** Perhaps a warning about lack of face blurring capability (if this is the case), but functioning push notifications.","closed","","quirk46","2020-06-06T00:11:57Z","2020-08-20T11:16:06Z"

Than pick a message to answer to (i really dont know how this happens, some swipe magic i belief and i really do not like this feature at all but does not matter here). Now this message is directly on top of the text input box to include in the next message to send.  This draft cannot be deleted anymore. I can input my own message in the text field and delete my own text but i cannot delete the old message signal wants to answer to. To get rid if it i _must_ send the message.  ### Steps to reproduce - open message list of a conversation - swipe somehow(?) to answer to a message from the list - now this message is stacked on top of text input field - delete this draft is impossible, no long-press, swipe or menu entry to stop answering with this message quoted  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  Message quote cannot be deleted, quoted message must be send to get rid of it.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  Quoted message can be delete, there should be an obvious / easy to find way to delete the draft (e.g. menu entry in top menu or similiar). I should not be forced to send the quote. There should be more ways to do this  than some hidden swipe actions no one knows  ### Screenshots  ### Device info  **Device:** Fairphone 2  **Android version:** 9 build from 19.03.2020 **Signal version:** 4.57.2  ### Link to debug log none  ### Side note ### How can this answering feature be disabled?","closed","","sseide","2020-03-27T11:16:29Z","2020-04-21T10:44:17Z"

Reinstalling always resolves the issue. I have seen the bug in both the stable release, as well as beta releases, both from FAD and Google Play. I live in Laos. I'm trying to communicate with various people to see if it might be tampering that happened before I received the device or if another app on the system is replacing Signal with a fake/monitored version. Other recent events have made me suspicious of foul play, possibly state-sponsored surveillance. I have Checkey installed and plan to see if the app has a different key when this behavior happens again (assuming it shows up again).","closed","wontfix,","rober42539","2020-11-04T10:29:36Z","2022-02-03T16:52:13Z"

However using the back button on the upper left corner works and navigates back to conversation overview. 2.

Given this, I obviously no longer get signal notifications when messages arrive as they only arrive when I check for them.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open the app - watch all the messages sent since the last time signal was open arrive and update the screen - Lament the messages where a notification would have been very useful to prevent me from appearing a bit rude. - I use the signal desktop client and love it. This issue persists when the signal desktop client is closed.  - Same for wifi or mobile data  **Actual result:** No notifications. Messages not recieved until signal is open in the foreground. **Expected result:** Receipt of message and notification when Signal is not in the foreground.  I have tried to remove every single possible OS restriction on Signal, battery optimsation, background data, as well as on google play services. Starting by following all possible interpretations of the steps here https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318711-Troubleshooting-Notifications. Searched this issue database and various other things on the web. Nothing I tried worked out. Willing to do whatever to help.   I tried updating to the beta. I've run out of ideas. I love signal and have used and recommended it to everyone and anyone for years. This issue is the first one that's making signal use a little difficult.  ### Device info Time          : 1607643798898 Manufacturer  : Ulefone Model         : Armor 9 Product       : Armor_9_EEA Screen        : 1080x2113, xxxhdpi (480), 60.00 hz Font Scale    : 1.0 Android       : 10 (root.20200605.114948, Armor 9_TF1_EEA_V01) ABIs          : arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, armeabi Memory        : 35M (60.64% free, 512M max) Memclass      : 256 OS Host       : root Censored      : false Play Services : true FCM           : true Locale        : en_AU Linked Devices: true First Version : 740 App           : Signal 5.0.1 (752, 7522) Package       : org.thoughtcrime.securesms (doDiFGKPO1r)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/0bd3ed5684e2ae795c9f4f67059451c4bf54caf5b1b487a774d8b657a9a3064c","closed","","hal88","2020-12-11T00:02:14Z","2021-01-18T05:39:26Z"

I just noticed it by chance because I wasn't receiving his messages in a group where both of us are members.  Some of findings / maybe useful information: * We've never written any private messages before * Searching for the contact on my phone didn't show this contact at all, he just wasn't existing there * The contact is stored in my phones address book * Searching for the contact on the connected desktop client showed the contact and there I had a button to ""approve"" him (in German ""Freigeben"", I don't know the actual translation). It was the same as de-blocking a blocked contact. * After approving him on the desktop client, I've written him a private message there and now the conversation is also showing up on my phone * I don't think the blocking happened accidentally, because at first he wasn't visible at all on my phone and on the desktop client I couldn't find the possibility to block a person.  **Actual result:** A contact seemed to be blocked by default, de-blocking only possible via desktop client **Expected result:** No blocking by default. If blocked, de-blocking should work on all clients, even if there wasn't any conversation before.  ### Link to debug log (A) My Phone: https://debuglogs.org/f3d55bc4f4e94cdf0f1741827956eeabadf4f9f70ef19245dd0ef66a6a74a5c9 (B) My Desktop Client: https://debuglogs.org/c2ca2fac32dfacb5bea591d44bac187a0a965a251296f54245d9a5757c6734f1 (C) Blocked Contact: https://debuglogs.org/78d523cd891e6f48ff9da65652d3650ac7732febfb595cb9dad1afdfabd65465  (C) wrote a message in a group yesterday, 27.Nov 2020, 22:56, which wasn't received by (A) or (B).

If you are in the activity that shows the sticker pack you can simply back out of the activity in order to hide the sticker preview.  If you are in a conversation, and have the sticker selector open and you long press on a sticker you will be unable to exit the sticker preview. And it will cover the signal ui until you pause or close the app.  Because this doesn't disappear, it can be hard to pick or preview another sticker after previewing one.  Additionally you will have to exit a conversation in order to continue to use the conversation.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open a conversation, then the sticker choose OR open a sticker pack from the add stickers page - Long Press on a sticker to preview it in full size and see the emoji tied to it  **Actual result:**  The sticker preview opens, however tapping on the sticker preview and/or hitting back will not make the preview go away.  **Expected result:**  When the sticker preview is open, I expect to be able to tap on the sticker preview which would call an onClick that would hide the sticker preview.  I also expect to be able to hit the back button to hide the sticker preview for sake of discover-ability (and the trust Android users have in the back button).  ### Screenshots  I would have to edit one in order to obfuscate  ![Screenshot_20200220-094204](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4002969/74945171-45077200-53c5-11ea-9d71-f73f9c19ffd2.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Essential PH1 **Android version:** 10.0 **Signal version:** 4.55.8","closed","wontfix,","mikeymop","2020-02-20T14:38:42Z","2022-02-04T03:50:54Z"

When the app is eventually opened, messages will arrive in rapid succession. This behavior creates the appearance that the timeliness of the signal service is unreliable, and is an obstacle for non-technical users who don't understand concepts like background execution and data saver.    ### Steps to reproduce - On Android device A, enable ""mobile data saver"" - Make sure Signal does not have unrestricted mobile data access - Disable WiFi - Close signal app - Use power button to put device to sleep - On device B, send a message to the number registered on device A  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour)  - Message status will show only one checkmark on sender's device. - Recipient's device will receive a push notification, but will not display any notification.   **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  If Signal has received a push notification, but cannot connect because data saver or a related feature prevents background data use, it should display a generic notification to entice the user to bring the application into the foreground so it can connect and retrieve messages.  ### Screenshots   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel XL **Signal version:** 4.55.8  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","brianr2600","2020-03-02T18:15:15Z","2022-04-13T17:08:38Z"

Unclear if this also applies to the creation of a brand-new PIN.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have a Signal account with registration lock enabled - Re-register the Signal account: Clear Signal data or use a different phone/profile with a clean Signal state in order to re-register the account. - After inputting SMS/CALL ME INSTEAD code, you are taken to an ""Enter your PIN"" screen that says ""Enter the PIN you created for your account. This is different from your SMS verification code."" - Without putting in any PIN or putting in a PIN that is too short (less than 4 digits), press the blue CONTINUE button  **Actual result:** The error message pops up as a toast (like RegistrationActivity_you_must_enter_your_registration_lock_PIN or RegistrationActivity_your_pin_has_at_least_d_digits_or_characters), and you can't input a PIN anymore. No keyboard is appearing and you are unable to focus on the input. **Expected result:** Able to input after inputting an invalid PIN  Invalid PINs generate these Toasts: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/6f39f9849a002f6361d192a00fbd7c52ffaf3bba/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/registration/fragments/RegistrationLockFragment.java#L144-L159  The line `pinEntry.setEnabled(false);` is never addressed when generating the Toasts. Could try putting `enableAndFocusPinEntry()` before the `return;`s  Side note: Likely better to not use a toast here. Toast covers up the blue button at the bottom.

The volume is extremely low. You cannot fix it without hanging up and starting with a regular Signal call.  If I start a regular call first and then transition to video, I can then use the speaker properly.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start a video call using the video call icon   **Actual result:** Speaker isn't properly used or the volume is low. **Expected result:** Should properly use the speaker.   ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 4 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.64.7  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/b6abe360b273922475e592feb5331393ac026bf92769a46479d91cc2814e2b17","closed","wontfix,","Tursko","2020-06-27T02:42:22Z","2022-02-02T09:59:11Z"

At least, the behavior should be consistent between waiting for the draft to load and not waiting.  I found this bug while trying to reproduce a bug I had: I left a conversation A, opened a conversation B, and the draft of the conversion A was in the conversation B. This also happened with quick user interactions (on a fairly slow phone, I guess this shouldn't happen on recent phones). If I manage to reproduce this peculiar bug, I'll create a new issue, but I assume they're related.  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/38700284f88efa33fbb0ae6df04034a1d0b960bf984da28e4aa651a0075b6846","closed","wontfix,","hiqua","2020-02-21T21:56:17Z","2022-02-02T21:27:58Z"

"","9453","VCF sent from iPhone causes Signal to hang","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description I was sent someone's contact info as a VCF/vCard file from an iPhone. When I opened my messages with that user, the app became unresponsive and had to be forcibly restarted. I had the person who sent me the VCF file send me several more regular messages, in the hopes that clearing the VCF data from the screen would work around the problem, but it didn't help. Any attempt to look at the messages from that person now causes Signal to hang.  In searching the bug database, I found several issues over the years about VCF not being supported, or causing app crashes. The issues causing crashes have been closed for years, and this is not a request to add support for VCF files.  ### Steps to reproduce - Have an iPhone user send contact info via SMS to a Signal user on Android. - The recipient opens Signal, and taps on the sender's name. - The app hangs - the cursor in the text entry field at the bottom does not blink. Pressing the virtual ""back"" button eventually leads to an Android dialog saying that the app is unresponsive, and asking if I want to wait/quit/send info.  **Actual result:** The app hangs. **Expected result:** The app displays (possibly unformatted) VCF data.   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3XL **Android version:** 10, security patch level February 5, 2020 **Signal version:** 4.56.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/d23ee7eac0412544a1656d8f9a1e149e7f3f9ec66b941f8f51e44457735ba686  This log was taken right after experiencing a hang (at 12:31p 2020-03-06).

"","9353","Storage usage seems to be shown incorrectly","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description I was recently exploring the ""Storage"" feature which shows the statistics of the storage used by *media messages.* That's when I found that the actual storage taken up by all the media files doesn't seem to be adding up to the usage shown in the main screen the space taken by all the media. Let me explain that in a little detail.   The total usage shown in the main screen is **25 MB** with the following split-up (pie-chart): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448084/72686211-330d8780-3b18-11ea-8b8f-e3f021c7f95e.png)  When I tap on “REVIEW STORAGE” to see the more detailed view, I found that there was nothing listed in the “Audio” and “Files” section. So, I’m not sure why “Files” occupies such a large portion of the pie-chart when I don’t have any. The case is same for “Videos”. I went through the files shown in the “Media” section and could not find any videos. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448084/72686219-3c96ef80-3b18-11ea-9a5a-55a014a5577c.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448084/72686229-66e8ad00-3b18-11ea-996f-34513905ec6b.png)  To find the total space taken up by the files in the “Media”, I selected all the files shown in the “Media” section (using the “Select All” option). The size it shows for the 54 items there is **7.9 MB**. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12448084/72686240-8384e500-3b18-11ea-8d32-15458fe50034.png)  So, there seems to be a gap of **17.1 MB** between the actual storage space used by the media files (**7.9 MB**) and the one shown in the main screen (**25 MB**). This is the reason why I think the storage usage is shown incorrectly.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung SM-J111F **Android version:** 5.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.53.7  *Note: Initially discussed in the [linked community forum post](https://community.signalusers.org/t/storage-usage-seems-to-be-shown-incorrectly/11179)*","open","acknowledged,","sivaraam","2020-01-19T18:37:55Z","2022-06-10T01:16:21Z"

When an SMS arrives, from a contact or not, there is NO notification posted into the normal Android notifications stack, and there is no audio indication that a new one has arrived. If I happen to open the signal App, I will see new message counts, and see the new messaged. This causes me to miss important ones, as I only tend to open the app if I have been pinged by a Signal contact/user (encrypted) or if I go to send a message. I also run the Desktop app on my Ubuntu desktop, so there I get normal Signal contact/user notifications of messages, and I tend to reply on the desktop too. Since Signal does not clone the new received messages to other connected device (in this case my desktop) then I can go for a couple of days not needing to check my phone (since I have not had any notifications) and in turn miss important SMS messages.  ### Steps to reproduce - receive unencrypted SMS from a standard Android contact (not a Signal user or a non contact (someone you have never received a SMS from or not in your Android contact list.  **Actual result:**  See Description above.  **Expected result:**  I expect my phone to add a notification for received SMS messages and respect notification sound settings.  ### Device info **Device:** HD1900 OnePlus 7T **Android version:** 10.0.12.HD65AA (Oxygen OS) **Signal version:** 4.71.5 All permissions and notification settings in Signal are enabled","closed","wontfix,","hipitihop","2020-09-25T04:14:47Z","2022-02-03T03:22:02Z"

I think it also eventually disappears if I just switch to another app without closing the activity manually.  Also noteworthy: opening, then closing, then opening does not open the notification. Closing (2nd time) and opening (3rd time) does open the notification.  ### Steps to reproduce - open the app (notification opens) - close the app (activity) - open the app (notification does not open) - close the app - open the app (notification opens)   **Actual result:** the notification disappears and Signal does not seem to check for new messages as regularly as it used to (when the notification was always there) **Expected result:** the notification should always be there so that Signal checks the messages on its own schedule   ### Device info **Android version:** 10 (LineageOS 17.1 with microg installed, but disabled, without gapps) **Signal version:** 5.0.5 **Battery optimization:** disabled for Signal  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/2590720a82f2880ac371769764ebc4e2bf4f54c2747401cdc1a0935e3c5a8786","closed","","hiqua","2020-12-15T18:41:06Z","2021-05-17T16:26:49Z"

When receiving new messages, all notifications show the same (incorrect) user profile picture in the notification drawer. I'm not 100% sure if this is the case for all contacts. It definitely happens for 3 of them and they all show the same incorrect picture. The picture shown was used for at least some (not sure if all) contacts in the ""in app"" contact list as well short after installation but that ""fixed itself"" after a few moments.  In short: * Incorrect profile pictures were shown in contact list short after installation (only lastet a few moments & ""fixed itself"") * Correct profile pictures are shown in contact list now * Incorrect profile picture is still shown in notifications  It seems like there's some internal cache which was incorrectly initialized & only updated for the contact list afterwards. Can I maybe somehow force a clean/rewrite of such a cache? I already tried restarting the phone to no avail.  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive message from someone  **Actual result:** Incorrect profile picture is shown in notification drawer **Expected result:** Correct profile picture in notification drawer  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20201223-080833](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30658772/102970940-b7bb0f80-44f8-11eb-8562-b4013399114c.png)  ### Device info **Device:** `Google Pixel 4a` **Android version:** `11`, Builr Nr. `RQ1A.201205.008` **Signal version:** `5.0.8`  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/b78310a068eba400dc6c1e152262bd52c6bbaa1fa69ea24e02441e67dc79eb27","closed","wontfix,","CombeeMike","2020-12-23T07:33:16Z","2022-02-03T08:08:52Z"

I can't/couldn't find a way to ask Signal to retry sending those messages. **Expected result:** For Signal to either automatically send my queued SMS-messages after a few minutes at most, and/or give me a reachable (maybe on the message details screen) option to force retry each/all message(s).  ### Device info **Device:** Nokia 5.3 **Android version:** 10 (security update July 1st, Google Play May 1st) **Signal version:** 4.77.3  ### Link to debug log Log captured **before** force quitting the app. Shows 5 Jobs that appear to be stuck.

I'm on grapheneOS so no google services and no microG. I posted the issue on reddit, and one person also on grapheneOS showed me a screenshot where Signal took 7% of their battery, with about the same time since full charge. Battery optimization is off, I can't even turn it on. App runs constantly in foreground (which I assume is normal for the websockets).  ### Steps to reproduce - use Signal with no google services or microG  **Actual result:** Signal takes between 40 and 50% of battery life **Expected result:** Signal should take ~10% of battery life  ### Screenshots  ![180aacb7-4a2f-46bc-ab2a-ce82e362eeda3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66792630/84412407-bbdbab80-abfe-11ea-8cdb-33a09cbfc7b4.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3a **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.62.4 (6520) from website  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/ab69b49388ae783727c5d47318d25296311a9f8f0cce64991fb28ae0830f2a34","open","acknowledged,","someone1239","2020-06-11T16:37:02Z","2022-08-03T13:17:32Z"

I think this is the fourth time in the last year.  Sometimes when clicking the update button in the client, nothing will happen for several minutes. No abnormal CPU usage or anything like that. The client is still running normally, it simply seems to not initiate the update process.  Then suddenly after several minutes (perhaps two or three), the client will close, and two or three Signal Setup will show on the task bar. The CPU usage goes to 100%, and the system becomes extremely sluggish, to a point where it's quickly impossible to even right click the task bar to open Task Manager. After a while there will be spawned more and more installers, filling up the task bar. The system will now becomes totally unresponsive. Mouse pointer cannot be moved, Ctrl Alt Del doesn't work. But more installers are still being produced on the task bar. In the end there might be perhaps 30-40 installers running, and it's obvious it's impossible to recover from this situation, so I have to hold the power button on the system to force a power off. (After the restart, I just manually download the newest installer and do it this way instead.)  ### Steps to reproduce - hit Update button in client when there is a request to do so. - Wait while you wonder why nothing is happening. - Wait. - Wait until you forget that you actually are updating the Signal client. - Client suddenly closes. - Several installers show up on task bar. - Sit back and observe as your system quickly sinks further and further down into The Bog of Unresponsiveness. - Give up and hit power button.  **Actual result:** System crashes hard. **Expected result:** Signal client should close, run the installer to do its update. Signal restarts. All done.  ### Screenshots Impossible to do screenshots wile this is happening.   ### Device info Windows 10 Pro, English [Version 10.0.18363.900]  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/e366444d19a229b3d8909d5b0463911d0a064f2fbcf175d1d598c06a275e6b60","closed","","demux4555","2020-07-15T11:03:11Z","2020-07-15T13:06:04Z"

After analysis the google play console issues the following alert.  ``` Security alert  Your app contains unsafe cryptographic encryption patterns. Please see this Google Help Center article for details.  Vulnerable classes:  org.whispersystems.signalservice.api.crypto.UnidentifiedAccess.deriveAccessKeyFrom ``` It seems according to the google link [https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9450925](url),  that the issue is because of the statically computed salt or initialization vector. Which is true if we look over the code:  ``` public static byte[] deriveAccessKeyFrom(ProfileKey profileKey) {     try {       byte[]         nonce  = new byte[12];       byte[]         input  = new byte[16];        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/GCM/NoPadding"");       cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(profileKey.serialize(), ""AES""), new GCMParameterSpec(128, nonce));        byte[] ciphertext = cipher.doFinal(input);        return ByteUtil.trim(ciphertext, 16);     } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | InvalidKeyException | NoSuchPaddingException | InvalidAlgorithmParameterException | BadPaddingException | IllegalBlockSizeException e) {       throw new AssertionError(e);     } } ```  ### Steps to reproduce  Upload the signed apk to play store.  My question is how did you publish the app ? Since this does not allow you to do this, and how can you circumvent this, because the code just masks the profile key, and you can't rely get around it.","closed","","muncescu1","2020-05-07T07:47:34Z","2020-05-26T17:54:10Z"

After this upgrade I can not send any message to the group. Instead of the text input field an message is displayed:  ""You can't send messages to this group because you're no longer a member."" (See first screenshot)  When I open the group settings and go back to the group chat without changing anything the text input wil be displayed but nothing happens when clicking the text input (no blinking cursor, no keyboard woll open)  ### Steps to reproduce This seems to be a regression bug, so I'm not able to provide reproducing method, without downgrading the app.  Here are the expected steps to reproduce - Install older version of signal (maybe from june 2020) - create a MMS group and write some messages within - upgrade to newest version of the app - go into the MMS group and try to write a message  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) There is no way to write a message to the old MMS group. Only a message is displayed ""You can't send messages to this group because you're no longer a member.""  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) To my knowledge there is no way another person can me remove from the MMS group. So it should be possible to write a message to the group.    ### Screenshots  ![Screenshot_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/243115/97991216-68ead680-1de1-11eb-9e0d-71029caf8a34.png) ![Screenshot_02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/243115/97991242-74d69880-1de1-11eb-9742-a9bbd53c0d7e.png) ![Screenshot_03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/243115/97991249-7acc7980-1de1-11eb-8c40-7290cb775f90.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 4 **Android version:** 11.0 **Signal version:** 4.75.8  ### Link to debug log","closed","","DavidWiesner","2020-11-03T13:43:13Z","2020-11-04T20:54:08Z"

Since 4.62.2, I noticed that one of my group which has a very long chat history takes a noticable time to load when opening it in the app. It's not critical, but I was wondering ... why is this even possible? Are conversations completely loaded when you click on them? Wouldn't it be possible to only load the last few messages? I'm also not sure if this is caused by the updates to the group chat UI that came with 4.62.2, but I never noticed a signifantly longer load time before. Please watch the screen cap below, I had to blur the whole thing, but you can clearly distinguish the panels/activities and you can also clearly see that the top-most conversation takes a split-second to load, while the other chat loads instantly. I think that now that Signal gets a lot of traction and the general feeling/UX got so much better, it is time to also pay attention to little details that may be minor but are nevertheless present.  ### Video link https://streamable.com/vamjdw  ### Device info **Device:** Nokia 8 TA-1012 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.62.2","closed","","julKali","2020-06-08T19:51:48Z","2020-06-08T21:23:44Z"

Signal crashes towards the end of the backup restoration process. The next time I open Signal, it prompts me to register but not restore a backup again (the size increase of the Signal application suggests that the backup has nominally been restored). However, Signal crashes again after it attempts to send a text message to verify my number. I never receive the text and I am not able to request a call as Signal crashes before that is possible. I periodically get rate limited and locked out of registration as a result. I'm using an ordinary mobile number with the associated SIM card inserted in my phone and not a VOIP number or any other unusual registration mechanism. I've been using this same phone number to register since TextSecure was first released.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Signal on new device - Follow prompts to restore backup - Re-open Signal after Signal crashes towards the end of backup restoration - Attempt to register number  **Actual result:** Signal crashes during backup restoration, Signal then crashes again while ostensibly waiting for a verification SMS to be sent to the specified phone number.  **Expected result:** The backup is restored properly and Signal can be re-registered to my phone number  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 3 XL **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.66.8  ### Link to debug log  I've attached a logcat dump as I'm unable generate a debug log in Signal due to its crashing.

Given the general bad experience with GIPHY (slow, huge bandwith requirements not suitable for mobile, generally really bad content quality, limited to mostly English, pixely upscaled stickers, duplicating the newer stickers functionality), **it would be a good idea to remove it completely,** and in the long run, move the animated images (actually short videos) functionality to the new sticker collection functionality, expanding from there.  [Allowing easy sticker generation from URLs (incluing generating sticker collections from Telegram sticker sets) on a website could complement the functionality for an easy transition and expland sticker collections to a usable set quickly. (But that’s a topic for a different bug, as it would be a feature request.)]  ### Steps to reproduce - Try to add a GIF. - Type in a topic you might want a GIF for.  **Actual result:** - The search is sent to a server now owned by Facebook, linked to your IP address, and certainly sold to everyone with a bit of money or a government letter. - Meaning you will now get harassed by targeted advertising related to what you entered. - The results are shown ... veeery slowly ... eating up all your mobile data cap ... - and you notice that they are pretty much useless too. Usually not even including a single correct match.  **Expected result:** - No data whatsoever should be sent to a Facebook-owned system. - Results should show fast. (E.g. by only loading the preview animation if the image it tapped and held while scrolling before releasing, like e.g. PornHub mobile does it.) - And results should be limited to good matches. Not limited to one site either, but more like a privacy-enabled version of Google's animated image search (with a warning triangle for ones in the old .gif format due to size issues.)  *Alternatively, GIPHY support shoud not exist at all, until a good solution has been found.*  ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei ALE-L21 **Android version:** 6.0 **Signal version:** 4.59.9","closed","","navid-zamani","2020-05-15T16:22:03Z","2022-07-20T15:17:40Z"

This message is not accurate as if I change the number to something else it proceeds to send the confirmation sms.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install signal - Register your number - Uninstall app or delete app data - Repeat above two steps 5-6 times  **Actual result:** After a few successful registrations the app eventually displays an error ""unable to connect to service"" even though connectivity is not the issue **Expected result:** Signal should tell the user why the registration isn't working.

The message gets sent and I can enter it but I get the same ""unable to connect to service"" as a toast message after that.

While PR #9750 fixes the issue, I found that the date text in each conversation thread in the list of MainActivity is not translated in the language that was just selected.   The bug was due to the locale object cached in the list adapter which was set by `Locale.getDefault()` at the moment it was first created, and survives `activity.recreate()`.  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Prepare an account that has one or more conversation. 1. Launch Signal. 1. Tap on your profile picture to open Settings. 1. Tap on Appearance. 1. Tap on Language. 1. Tap on Japanese (or Chinese or any other language that is not the current one). 1. Either tap on the left arrow on the action bar or tap the back button on the device to go back to Settings. 1. Again, either tap on the left arrow on the action bar or tap the back button on the device to go back to the conversation list.  **Actual result:**  Date text is not translated to the language that was selected.  **Expected result:**  Every time you choose a language, the date text in each conversation thread in the list is translated in that language.  ### Screenshots  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28482/84957943-496d3e80-b0ca-11ea-90c4-2b76de36b177.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** AVD Pixel 2 **Android version:** 9 (API 28) **Signal version:** 4.64.0","closed","","fumiakiy","2020-06-17T22:35:28Z","2020-06-25T22:29:24Z"

I have used Signal for many years now and one of the major plus points was, that it could correctly ""link"" ""special contacts"" (e.g. SMS from my bank, and so on) to a real contact in my adressbook and therefore it will display the contact picture. Aside from the fact that this really looks nicer (especially in the notification bar) it is also an added layer of ""security"" for me, that not someone else is sending me an SMS in the context of my bank, ... of course someone could ""missuse"" this by using the same sender name, but still :)  It still works fine for normal contacts and phone numbers, but for example banks (in Germany for example ""BSK-Hall, HB-Secure, and so on) or other companies (e.g. o2 is using ""o2 Team"" with a space) use a ""special contact number"" which signal used to work fine - but now it doesnt anymore. I guess this is linked to the **-** in the display name in Signal (or some space "" ""). See ""steps to reproduce""  ### Steps to reproduce - Receive a SMS from a ""special contact"", e.g. BSK-Hall - Click either on the contact and click ""add to contacts"" (in german: ""Zu Kontakten hinzufügen"") or open the thread itself, use the ""more options"" button (three dots) and do the same (add to contacts) - use either an existing contact or create a new one... doesnt mather  **Actual result:** the ""special contact number"" (e.g. BSK-Hall, HB-Secure, ...) will be display in the ""phone number"" section, but after storing the contact it is not ""linked"" correctly to the thread and therefore the contact picture is not shown. Redoing the steps makes it possible to add the ""special contact number"" again and again, but it will not work either way.   **Expected result:**  the ""special contact number"" (e.g. BSK-Hall, HB-Secure, ...) is correctly linked to the conversation and after switching back to the signal app it will show the contact picture of the selected contact. I have done this for many companys and it worked with several banks, DHL, ... you name it. About a year ago it stopped working and I hope this issue tracker will bring it back. It looks like the contact app does not store special characters like **-** or "" "" in the number (or signal does not forward it correctly?) and this seems to be the problem - because it always deletes the special character when going from signal to the contact app. When I manually add those characters in my Nextcloud App, the contact app just ignores it (still displays BSKHall instead of BSK-Hall), but after resyncing/refresh of the contacts (""german: aktualisieren"") in Signal it displays (BSK-Hall) and the connection works - so Signal seems to handle it correctly, at least in one direction :)  The Nextcloud Workaround seem to work for me, but maybe there is better way for other customers? If nextcloud could add it regardless of the contact app disregarding the ""symentic"", maybe Signal could too? Or maybe Signal could check for a phone number with or without those special characters?  ### Screenshots ![Screenshot_20200726-201643_Contacts(1)_copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24806068/88486418-b0a9c880-cf7d-11ea-8057-3f0c17c73b78.jpg) ![Screenshot_20200726-201409_Signal(1)_copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24806068/88486420-b1daf580-cf7d-11ea-989b-f53c6d94d607.jpg)  ### Device info tried may devices and it stopped working without changing the phone. **Device:** Samsung S10e (G970F) ** Contacts on Nextcloud - Sync via Davdroid **Android version:** 10, July security patch **Signal version:** 4.67.1  ### Link to debug log necessary?

I believe this is an issue with MediaStore on Android P. I notice there was a fix implemented for KitKat that reverts it back to the previous behavior for API levels less than 21. Would it be possible to bump that up to less than or equal to 28, so that the Android P issue isn't triggered? I don't believe this should cause any further problems as the legacy URI should work flawlessly with Android P and lower.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open a video - Tap ... , then click Save - Navigate to sdcard  **Actual result:** Video saved in /video/ with *.3gp container **Expected result:** Video saved in /movies/ with *.mp4 container  ### Device info  **Android version:** 9.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.78.2","closed","wontfix,","mitomenai","2020-11-19T10:53:31Z","2022-02-03T17:52:33Z"

Tested with and without external sdcard. Tested with latest stable release and current beta 4.61.6.  I also checked, I have ~3GB of chats and have 12GB free space on both sdcard and on the internal storage.  I remove the storage-related permissions for the android app, and enabled them again, but to no avail.  Sounds similar to #9548, #9083 or others, but the ones I found did seem to be caused by storage woes.  From what I can see in the debug logs (I am not a developer...) it fails with the following error: ``` 2020-05-23 14:38:39.566 MESZ W FullBackupExporter: null 2020-05-23 14:38:39.566 MESZ W FullBackupExporter: java.io.IOException: Prematurely reached end of stream!

This has happened on multiple calls with different people (Both of them were using iphones). Usually the call drops pretty quickly (within a couple minutes) but the time doesn't seem consistent. This problem arose months ago, I'm not sure how many. I used to be able to video call the same people without any issues, for conversations well over half an hour with zero drops.  Audio only calls may have this issue as well. I've had at least one audio only call drop before but it has taken much longer for it to happen (20 mins - couple hours and most calls it never happens) and it's only happened 1-2 times so I'm unsure if it's a consistent thing or related to the consistent video issue.  ### Steps to reproduce - Start a video call in signal - Wait for a few minutes for the call to drop  **Actual result:** Call drops with no message or error. **Expected result:** Call continues.  ### Device info  **Device:** Nokia 6.1 (TA-1045) **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.58.4  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/897cb3ad1efa6e919b7fdbf5cc38c645d81f01d1e7aa4ba990dc74cfb0cd4e30","closed","wontfix,","malnoxon","2020-04-04T00:42:35Z","2022-02-04T03:51:01Z"

This is an unnecessary switch to bother users with.  ### Steps to reproduce - enable the indicators using that silly toggle switch in Privacy options - look at the message details on a number of your send messages in a group chat - note that on some the indicators are displayed, but on some there are no indicators displayed - scratch your head, and wonder if this is merely the indicator not showing or some kind of deeper issue with sealed senders  **Actual result:** Indicators not showing on all send messages **Expected result:**  Indicators should show on all send messages  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus **Android version:** 9.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.55.4  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/16501890c8614eb38c9f78c544df1b23d1e06ee31d13204b69d7e2bb9451d380  One of these messages wad one I send 7 feb @ 15:28:22 CET","closed","","Meteor0id","2020-02-08T12:19:35Z","2021-06-09T10:02:18Z"

Unable to create backup on Sony Xperia Z5 Compact despite chat backups being enabled  I have recently obtained a new phone and I would like to transfer my messages from Signal on my old phone to my new phone. Obviously, in order to do this, the first thing I need to do is create a backup on Signal on my old phone. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, I am unable to create a backup on my Sony Xperia Z5 Compact running Android version 7.1.1 - when I press ‘Create backup’ nothing happens. This is despite the fact that I have enabled ‘Chat backups’, ensured the necessary permissions for Signal are enabled, ensured there is enough space to create a backup on the device, and I do not have an SD card in my device. Of course this is very frustrating as I would like to transfer my messages to my new phone so I can begin to use it. I have contacted the official email support but have not had a response yet. I would be very grateful for your help.  ### Steps to reproduce - open Signal and settings - enable chat backups - try to create backup by pressing 'Create backup'  **Actual result:**    Nothing happens after running the steps above except that a Signal notification symbol very briefly appears in the notification panel at the top of the screen for a few milliseconds or so and then disappears.  **Expected result:**   I'm not exactly sure what the expected behaviour should be but I imagine a backup should be created somehow.  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 4.58.5  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/8b7508e70c8df7f703b29c25a536003c6f4f06d8f65045ff4b38558d4a983fa0","closed","","oXvTV","2020-04-17T19:15:03Z","2021-04-14T19:43:09Z"

The already recorded part of the voice message is lost. There is no indication that the voice message is still recording. There is no indication that the voice message recording has even started. There is no way to get the already recorded message back. **Expected result:** Signal should continue to record the voice message when switching apps. It should display an overlay over the app just like the native phone app does when being in a call. If this is not possible, it should try to warn the user *before* aborting recording the voice message. If that is not possible, it should at least display something like _recording voice message was interrupted by switching apps_ to give a hint why the recording has stopped. **Reproducible:** always, on different devices  ### Screenshots There is no indication on the aborted voice message recording whatsoever, so there are no useful screenshots to make.   ### Device info  **Device:** HMD Global Nokia 5 **Android version:** 9 patchlevel 2020-10-01 **Signal version:** 5.0.5 (has been present in the 4.x cycle for a long time too, i.e. this is no recent regression)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/819292680173d54f69040d97be2c89f1331c84ad2a09da4a819c9f6ae3e7c5f5","closed","","genodeftest","2020-12-19T13:47:11Z","2021-08-31T05:17:27Z"

This means they don't know each other's profile information - Have A try to video call B - Have B accept A's call - Have a call - End the call  **Actual result:** User B gets their phone ringed by User A, despite never having shared their profile with each other before, and User B can accept or decline the call. Subsequent calls prompt a call request (unless User B selects the Delete button). **Expected result:** User B doesn't have their phone ringed, because User B did not share their profile with User A.  ### Screenshots User A is ""A user"" in these screenshots. These screenshots are from the perspective of User B.  This shows that the first call attempt was able to get through and both users had a video call (the `+1***** called you` message). Then, the second call attempt was met with a call request (the `Missed call` message).   You can see that User A has never talked to User B before, because only the phone number is shown in the chat history. No profile information. (Related bug: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9938)  ![numbers1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56524388/90699094-47913a00-e237-11ea-8d63-6fce0ef0c9e2.jpeg)  ### Other notes - User A is a newly registered Signal account. - No Google Play services on both devices. - If User B presses the ""Delete"" option, User A can call again to actually ring User B again, and then calls after that will be hit with a call request. - When User A sends a regular message and thus shares their profile information (see https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9938), then this no longer happens. Every call will be a call request until User B shares their profile information.  ### Device info  **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.69.3","closed","","jisckim23","2020-08-19T23:28:59Z","2020-08-20T05:48:27Z"

Two different Bluetooth headsets continue to be in their ""phone call"" state and do not automatically disconnect and transition back to ""media state"". Manual intervention by pressing a physical call termination button sometimes terminates the call from the phone's perspective, at other times the only way to rectify the situation is by placing a call with another properly functioning application (which will show the Bluetooth device as still set to phone) and then terminating the call properly at which time the Bluetooth device will be able to act as a media sink again..  ### Steps to reproduce - Place a voice call and connect to a Bluetooth headset - Terminate the call - Try to play media through the headset  **Actual result:** Audio is not heard on the Bluetooth device even if ""play media to"" under sound settings is set to the Bluetooth device. Attempting to adjust volume will indicate a call volume widget and grayed out media audio widget.  **Expected result:** The headset should disconnect from call audio when the signal audio call is terminated and be able to act as a sink for media and other audio without manual interaction.  ### Screenshots   https://debuglogs.org/9976d1d7514a50c34a519e93e4fa5325052e9364c6417e2ff4bc45b2a371faf5 ![signal-attachment-2020-05-25-004058_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/82767782-f6350280-9e21-11ea-87d8-15df912e029a.jpeg) The phone believes it is outputting media audio to the Bluetooth device (but is not).  ![signal-attachment-2020-05-25-004058_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/82767789-faf9b680-9e21-11ea-9cd3-139c64b0a486.jpeg) The volume widget is incorrect and shows a null call in progress and no indication of Bluetooth connectivity.  ![signal-attachment-2020-05-25-004058_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317194/82767791-fdf4a700-9e21-11ea-9969-ae4206dd58dd.png)  The Bluetooth device appears under ""call"" even though the call has been disconnected.  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 XL **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.60.5  ### Link to debug log","closed","","mmirg","2020-05-24T23:57:11Z","2020-05-29T12:08:33Z"

Because of memory shortage due to signals backup size I introduced a „move to external storage feature“ (with automate) to be able to store and keep even older messages.  Now I noticed that the backup job only starts to run if and only if Wien the time frame has been passed (that‘s as it used to be) and additionally (and that‘s the new constraint) when the mobile phone is being plugged for charging, without respect to the current charging state nor how long the time frame constraint has been fullfilled. Even if the device is being unplugged immediately the backup job continues to run which makes the new constraint absurd.  Furthermore I noticed that there are 2 backups written within a shorter period of another time frame window.  ### Steps to reproduce - wait if time frame window has been passed - plug device for charging, backup will immediately - wait some time period for second backup (about 1,5-2h)  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour)  I‘d expect to run backup even if it‘s Not nessecarilly plugged for charging, rather take schedule, intervall and charging capacity into consideration, also best if configurable by user!  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola moto e4 **Android version:** 7.1.1 **Signal version:** 5.0.8  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/d5c7ea609f3dd0a0b8a5c0d787a720d8ddc6d11277b9de747360a6ecbcb50259","closed","","CarlosCastaneda","2020-12-27T16:51:15Z","2020-12-29T15:37:11Z"

Usually this happens about every other time, though recently it happened at least half a dozen times in a row. Also, when attaching an image, it often pops up twice, causing the image to be sent twice.  ### Steps to reproduce - Install Automagic, select a flow, and select ""Send Flow"" - Choose Signal and a contact, so it shows the composed message containing the flow - Press send button, and sometimes it will send the flow, but often the draft message will just disappear and nothing is sent - Go back to Automagic and repeat the process and hope it works this time  - Open gallery (I use Simple Gallery) - Share a picture, and select Signal and a contact - When it shows the Signal screen with the image and the text input line and send button, it sometimes immediately switches to another copy of the screen, and when you send, that goes away and it shows the first copy, and if you press send again, you've now sent two copies of the image  **Actual result:** It doesn't send the attachment (flow) or it sends it twice (photo; technically, doesn't send it twice, but shows duplicate draft screen which can result in the user sending it twice) **Expected result:** It should send the flow and it should only open one instance of the ""draft"" screen for sharing the image  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Moto Z Play **Android version:** 8.0 **Signal version:** 5.0.5  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","vertigo220","2020-12-17T04:32:55Z","2022-02-03T14:26:08Z"

Signal will display them when used, but does not treat them as emoji by enlarging them when used by themselves. They also prevent regular emoji from being enlarged when used in combination with them.  Note that this is with ""use system emoji"" enabled. When ""use system emoji"" is disabled, Signal doesn't have built-in equivalents for the new emoji, so it falls back to system emoji in those cases (but they still aren't enlarged as they should be).  ### Steps to reproduce 1. Open Signal on Android 11 2. Type new emoji in a message 3.

"","9578","Version 4.59.6 not starting background sync service with microG (GCM disabled)","- [X] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [X] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [X] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [X] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description After the 4.59.6 update, the background sync service that is used when Play Services isn't present fails to start reliably. When the app is first installed, the normal ""Optimize for missing Play Services"" prompt is given, which is fine. But the background service notification does not show up until some ~30 minutes after app startup. After rebooting the phone, the service does not start up at all.   This is occurring on microG without GCM/FCM integration turned on. My suspicion is that the recent commit eea7174f1de6a6d8a2e67dfd788524189b71f51c caused this. The way it checks for presence of Play Services is different than the way Signal decides whether or not to use the backgound sync service during initial setup.   Once Signal has decided that Play Services exists, it tries to register to Firebase over and over, which of course fails...  ### Steps to reproduce (upgrade) - Upgrade from previous version to Signal 4.59.6 on a device without Play Services. - Phone number becomes unregistered. - After re-registering, background sync service does not start reliably or at all.  ### Steps to reproduce (fresh installation + backup restoration) - Install Signal 4.59.6 on a device without Play Services. - Accept turning off battery optimizations. - Use the app. - Background sync service starts after ~30 minutes. - After reboot, it refuses to start the background sync service at all.  **Actual result:** Background sync connection does not start, or only starts after some time (and operates unreliably, seemingly). Messages don't come until opening the app when the background sync service is not running. **Expected result:** Background sync service starts immediately, showing the notification that a background connection is enabled. Messages arrive in real time.  **Other Info:** I took the debug log after a phone reboot. It seems to be trying to initialize the Firebase messaging service (it fails to get a token of course). I don't know if it normally tries to do this when it should be using the background sync service, but I find it odd that it attempts to use FCM in this case. **More importantly,** the entries of `gcm disabled` in the log start as `false`, then eventually go to `true` (when sync service is running), then back to `false` (after reboot).  ### Device info  **Device:** OnePlus 6 A6003 **Android version:** Android 10 OmniROM microG (11, QQ2A.200405.005 release-keys) **Signal version:** 4.59.6  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/3c613b05b463aa698b2adcbb9d79c96f5f9ddbd327726db84e7afa82eddf2698","closed","","ProjectMoon","2020-05-02T21:31:45Z","2020-05-22T20:49:30Z"

I was able to solve the bug by deleting the mp3 notification sound from that location (so it seems to be reproducible), however lack of access should not cause the app to crash; if Signal cannot access the file, it should prevent it from being set as a notification sound in the first place.  ### Steps to reproduce - set a notification sound for a contact from a mp3 file on the phone in Zedge's default file download directory - lock signal - attempt to unlock signal  **Actual result:** Signal crashes after entering unlock pin on app lock screen **Expected result:** Signal should unlock and go to the conversation screen  ### Screenshots Not relevant  ### Device info See debug log  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/60caaac1572c1f8aea01075bcfd0974fb4065638fda8f3f70d82a32ee65c514d","closed","wontfix,","magic-ian","2020-11-06T19:08:20Z","2022-02-03T16:52:16Z"

The keyboard app that I use is GBoard and it indicates characters are being selected as I have character pop-up when I enter a key, but again, the text does not show up in the textbox and the app will not allow me to send the contents of the textbox (not being able to send the contents is Expected Behaviour as the textbox is empty).  - Important to note: It is possible to caption the media file, as this is works as expected  If the current thread (X) (which the most recent message was the media file) is backed out of, to all the conversations then re-selecting the thread (X) with the media file allows one to type messages into the textbox and send textual messages again, until another media file is sent.  - Important to note: when viewing all messages (on app homescreen), the thread (X) does not indicate _Draft_, but this is expected behaviour as the textbox was empty when initially backing out of the thread (X) after attempting to type into the textbox after sending a media file.  ### Steps to reproduce - open conversation with individual - Select media file (that is not audio recording), easy to reproduce if it is a GIF from in-built GIF keyboard - Send the (media file) GIF - Try to input text into textbox  **Actual result:** Text does not appear in the textbox when typing, textbox remains empty, nothing is sent if User presses Enter to send **Expected result:** Text appears in textbox, textbox contents is sent to reciepient  ### Device info **Device:** Google Pixel 2XL **Android version:** 11 **Signal version:** 4.67.3  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/931d9d406a8a9a7f6e86fb2a7c20796c6970a0036dd9f877cb38b08b4d93e526","closed","","janusanb","2020-07-30T16:22:58Z","2020-12-23T19:25:44Z"

This seems related to #9453 except that the app crashes immediately rather than hanging. Other potentially relevant issues are #8759 and #7280.  Since the stack trace seemed to indicate that the issue came from notifications I tried disabling notifications for Signal system wide and rebooting, but this did not fix the issue.  ### Steps to reproduce - use Signal as default SMS client on Android - Receive large SMS message (such as VCF) - Attempt to open the app by tapping the icon.  **Actual result:** App shows the conversations overview for ~500ms before crashing. **Expected result:** App opens without crashing and I am able to open the conversation containing the unread VCF data.  ### Screenshots  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2405952/84238901-9a6ca980-aab0-11ea-8b56-6814c42f0f7e.png)  - Signal is not the default app because I switched to the default Messages app in hopes of maybe deleting the offending SMS and to be able to use SMS functionality  ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 4 XL  **Android version:** 10, security patch level April 5, 2020 **Signal version:** 4.61.6  ### Link to debug log Debug log was captured via ADB as the app does not open. ``` --------- beginning of crash 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: signal-unbounded-0 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 4887 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.RuntimeException: android.os.TransactionTooLargeException: data parcel size 1137024 bytes 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.NotificationManager.notifyAsUser(NotificationManager.java:497) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.NotificationManager.notify(NotificationManager.java:444) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at androidx.core.app.NotificationManagerCompat.notify(NotificationManagerCompat.java:215) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at androidx.core.app.NotificationManagerCompat.notify(NotificationManagerCompat.java:199) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.notifications.DefaultMessageNotifier.sendSingleThreadNotification(DefaultMessageNotifier.java:401) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.notifications.DefaultMessageNotifier.updateNotification(DefaultMessageNotifier.java:315) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.notifications.DefaultMessageNotifier.updateNotification(DefaultMessageNotifier.java:228) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.notifications.OptimizedMessageNotifier.updateNotification(OptimizedMessageNotifier.java:60) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.messages.InitialMessageRetriever.begin(InitialMessageRetriever.java:105) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ApplicationContext.lambda$catchUpOnMessages$2(ApplicationContext.java:391) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.-$$Lambda$ApplicationContext$VK9QLxgYFdkGxnAvWM7hmkqYb6I.run(Unknown Source:2) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1167) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:641) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:919) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: android.os.TransactionTooLargeException: data parcel size 1137024 bytes 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.BinderProxy.transactNative(Native Method) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.BinderProxy.transact(BinderProxy.java:511) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.INotificationManager$Stub$Proxy.enqueueNotificationWithTag(INotificationManager.java:2791) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.NotificationManager.notifyAsUser(NotificationManager.java:494) 06-09 23:21:24.122  4887  5177 E AndroidRuntime: 	... 13 more ```","closed","wontfix,","kaseyc","2020-06-10T07:39:23Z","2022-02-03T22:41:07Z"

Please try again later"". Only once I created a profile, I could join the group. For some reason, Signal failed to ask me to setup my profile.  ### Steps to reproduce  I've not actually tried to reproduce this but this is roughly how I remember the events leading to the issue:  - Weeks ago, I registered with Signal using one of those freely available numbers one can find online. - I got de-registered when someone else registered the number with Signal after the Registration Lock expired. - Today, I updated to 4.71.1. - I registered with Signal using a new number. - I tried to join a GV2 using the link from the [Signal Community Forum](https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-testing-the-new-gv2-groups-big-signal-group-with-as-many-volunteering-forum-members-as-possible/17030) - Attempt failed with ""[u]nable to join group. Please try again later"". I tried several more times over the next few hours. - I realized that I never setup a profile, so I did. - Joining worked.  I'm not sure if I had a version of Signal installed that did not yet force people to create a profile when I got unregistered and that is the reason I was never asked to setup a profile or if the profile was simply dropped when Signal got unregistered. Either way, users should probably be forced to setup their profile when re-registering.  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola One Vision **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.74.1  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/263d94b45840c580742b4ea2915abe75b6544d6b79fc2f52d031b7b228c5d9b4","closed","","pgerber","2020-10-17T19:36:26Z","2021-09-01T17:32:06Z"

"","9905","Video turns on unexpectedly when performing a voice call after a video call","- [x] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates - [x] I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended - [x] I have read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports - [x] This isn't a feature request or a discussion topic  ----------------------------------------  ### Bug description After a video call between two users, a Signal voice call from/to the same user after that causes the video camera to turn on for one of the participants (with one exception) as soon as the voice call starts. The camera should instead be off (unless either participant decides to turn it on manually after the call has started).    The last two calls in the first debug log include an example of one of the scenarios listed below (can't remember which one, sorry).   The second debug log should include all four scenarios in quick succession, as well as a crash report right after I shared the first debug link to an app (Signal crashed when closed the other app and I returned to Signal - this did not happen when I shared the second debug link, for some reason).  ### Steps to reproduce Note: A and B are two Signal users  - Scenario 1   1) A video calls B, B picks up   1) A closes the video call   1) A voice calls B, B picks up, A's camera turns on  - Scenario 2   1) A video calls B, B picks up   1) A closes the video call   1) B voice calls A, A picks up, B's camera turns on  - Scenario 3   1) A video calls B, B picks up   1) B closes the video call   1) A voice calls B, B picks up, A's camera stays off (as expected)  - Scenario 4   1) A video calls B, B picks up   1) B closes the video call   1) B voice calls A, A picks up, B's camera turns on  **Actual result:** In scenarios 1, 2, 4, the video camera of one of the participants immediately turns on after picking up, in spite of the fact that the ""turn video on"" button has NOT (yet) been pressed. **Expected result:** When picking up a voice call, the camera should stay off (at least until the ""turn video on"" button is pressed). Only scenario 3 seems to match the expected behaviour.  ### Device info **Devices:** Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Samsung Galaxy S6 **Android version:** 8.1 stock (both) **Signal version:** 4.68.3 from Play Store (both) Note: either device can be A or B when reproducing this bug - I successfully reproduced all four scenarios on both devices.  ### Link to debug log First log: https://debuglogs.org/75798d02da73379d9e188fdeb1f8aab86c76407cf9dd878984b0c09f57caf991  Second log: https://debuglogs.org/418c0b163376fd5949ec753296c07470507339c733f6f3e9f5ce011b1e733f44","closed","wontfix,","shadow00","2020-08-04T19:30:10Z","2022-01-28T00:50:20Z"

When I browse to the location of the backup I can see it in the directory but it is greyed out and I cannot select it.  The backup was done using Signal v4.76.3 from the Playstore (Aurorastore).  The restore was tried with the apk v4.76.3 from the Homepage. After it didn't work with the downloaded apk I tried again with the version from the Playstore and had the same result.  I also tried an older backup from the time when the backup location was fix (/Signal/Backups/) with the same result.   ### Steps to reproduce - delete Signal App - reinstall it - select ""restore Backup"" - browse to file location - realize you cannot select the .backup file   ### Device info **Device:** Motorola Moto G5 **Android version:** Android 10 (LineageOS 17.1 without gApps) **Signal version:** 4.76.3  ### Link to debug log [debug log](https://debuglogs.org/34eeee7bf7808702d3c0935068ee03caa7b5960b643c86e8ff7fbbb80daf36e0)  (Info: to get the debug log I tried to restore the backup.

I sent a Signal message to this contact and got a confirmation that they received it (double tick), so I think the Signal account still exists.  ### Steps to reproduce - In a group with already 6 members, do ""add members"" - add this contact  Note that this is the first time that this happened to me, so I don't think it's easily reproducible. There are exceptions in the debug log that might be worth investigating though.   **Actual result:**  Contact not added.  **Expected result:**  Contact added.   ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/5f5726145d09b10d50135638658f26738aa1ebaa3ff4b108ec4598121533d174","closed","","hiqua","2020-06-21T10:07:35Z","2021-02-04T18:28:10Z"

If the phone is in flight mode the app works normally, and it appears to be able to send and receive messages in the background, (if minimised and connected to the network). If mobile data is on (regardless of WiFi connectivity status), the app crashes immediately upon launching the UI, if mobile data is off, but WiFi is connected then it reportedly takes a second or two to crash after launching (but still crashes every time). From the logs, the only exception from within signal appears to be an AssertionError ""Must have either a UUID or a phone number!"" in StorageSyncModels.localToRemoteContact()  They've tried reinstalling signal and recreating the backup and the same issue occurs. Signal has all available permissions (but is not the default SMS app - they have tried with it as the default, which had no effect).  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola G8 Plus **Android version:** 9 (Security version 1st August 2020) **Signal version:** 4.70.5  ### Link to debug log Can't send the log from within signal, due to the crash (as a side note, it would be really useful for issues like this if you could copy the text on the debug log screen, or export to a file!)

Even if this is related to cell service, I don't think that their messages should be coming in (and failing) in their own separate threads.  ### Screenshots ![mms failure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18274896/74210252-86bf4c80-4c50-11ea-9d8f-877f52ac6be5.png)   ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 4 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.53.7  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/c2beece5ad8b00f7feea8913a624560d34e85c9771bf00a5e46a281926bee999","closed","","Tursko","2020-02-11T04:01:40Z","2020-11-19T19:10:21Z"

They said it worked perfectly fine a few updates ago, so it might be a regression. It happens randomly.   ### Steps to reproduce - Send message to Nokia Phone User - The message has 2 checkmarks from the sender side - The Nokia Phone User doesn't get a Notification, but when he opens Signal he sees the new Messages  **Actual result:** Sometimes no Notification for the Nokia Phone User **Expected result:** There should always be a notification for new messages   ### Device info Phone with the Debug Log: **Device:** Nokia 6.1 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.76.3  Other Phones that had this Problem: Nokia 6 (Android 9), Nokia 7.2 (Android 10).  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/69f8fa5f304e55782b94144aed79b84b75cfec14e8f3086c8116ee545a28e28a  I sent 2 messages at 15:30 from my Phone. One was a picture, the other one was text. At about 18:19 I told the Nokia Phone User she had a message (in real life) and she opened the chat with me, read the messages and then sent a debug log to me. She said there was no notification and she only opened Signal, because I told it to her.   ### Notes I can't guarantee that this Problem is exclusive to Nokia Devices, but on my Phone from Asus everything works fine. This issue could be a duplicate of #8692, but I don't think so. If I am wrong I can close this and copy paste it there.","closed","wontfix,","Nisc3d","2020-11-13T17:56:58Z","2022-02-03T16:52:25Z"

Unfortunately, I cannot pinpoint which release brought the regression. - Edit: After the attempt to send such a photo, Signal eats the battery.  ### Steps to reproduce - Take a photo in portrait mode, preferably with Motorola Camera. - Switch to a conversation in Signal. - Press (+) to add an attachment. - Notice that no preview is shown, select ""black"" photo and send.  **Actual result:** No preview is shown in both, photo selection and for the outgoing message. An empty message is sent. Curiously, tapping the outgoing message brings up the photo. After leaving the conversation, a brocken image icon is shown in the message.  **Expected result:** I expect preview to be shown for portrait mode photos.

I'll give a descriptive account of what happened before and at the beginning of when the issues manifested themselves:  *A little before I updated to Signal 4.64.7, I got a “Message could not be decrypted” messages from one contact. I fixed that by resetting the secure session. However, the “Message could not be decrypted” messages started to appear again soon after that. (In the mean time, I had updated Signal to 4.64.7 myself.)*  *After the update, I’ve had the issues with Signal described above. One of my contacts has similar problems on a different device. Another one I've not been able to reach; I assume they may have a similar issue.*  *Regarding the battery drain: this is really reproducible: after restarting Signal it starts again. However, my battery monitor doesn’t show Signal as the one responsible.*  ### Steps to reproduce - start Signal  **Actual result:** Issues described above. **Expected result:** No issues, as before.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S4 Mini Duos (serranods; GT-I9192) **Android version:** 8.1.0 (LineageOS 15.1) **Signal version:** 4.64.7  ### Link to debug log Unavailable!","closed","","equaeghe","2020-06-29T11:52:04Z","2022-02-01T18:44:53Z"

There is then a gross mismatch between what the iOS user thinks is being shown, and what the Android user actually sees. There's no obvious way to toggle this behavior, for that matter.  ### Steps to reproduce - Initiate a video call between iOS and Android Signal installations. (This might also apply to other combinations that I didn't test.)  - Hold the iOS phone horizontally so as to create a landscape orientation. Then, no matter how the Android phone is oriented, it will always show the middle third vertical strip of the landscape.  **Actual result:** Android: ""I said, hold the phone horizontally!"" iOS: ""I am! Can't you see the left and right side of the street?"" Android: ""No! I see only the road ahead!

This does not happen when messages come in when the app is closed/in the background or the phone screen is turned off.   I first noticed this about a month ago, but I cannot be sure when it was first introduced. I have updated to the most recent version of Signal and confirmed that it is still occurring.   ### Steps to reproduce - Message a friend - Keep the chat open (instead of switching to another app or turning off the screen) - When they message you back, listen to the notification sound - Repeat steps 1-3, except instead of keeping the chat open, press ""home"" to close Signal and press the power button to turn off your screen.  **Actual result:** When the chat is open, the sound plays with audible distortion artifacts (a crackling/popping sound) **Expected result:** The notification sound should play the same way when the chat is open and when Signal is closed   ### Device info  **Device:** Pixel 4 XL (coral) **Android version:** 0.0.0 **Signal version:** 5.0.5  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/6d4c054accf843dbd9542d049069c59f7c6e8cb61a1e9376aab848f127d5eae2","closed","wontfix,","ChimeraCoder","2020-12-16T17:14:49Z","2022-02-03T14:26:05Z"

I don't have backups enabled. Then I reinstalled Signal, re-registered, without PIN. When clicking the ""edit"" button to start a new message, I could display the contacts, but when I clicked one, the app crashed. When I received a message, I could see it in the messages overview, but when I clicked on the sender's name to open the conversation, the app crashed.  Then I created a debug log, and while reading the stack trace of the exception, the line `at android.telephony.SmsManager.isImsSmsSupported(SmsManager.java:1410)` caught my attention. Why would opening a conversation screen require something like SMS support?  So as a wild guess, I opened the Signal settings and made Signal my default SMS app, and the bug was gone, I was able to open conversation screens.  Since I don't want Signal to be my default SMS app, I changed that setting back to the Android messaging app in the Android settings, and luckily, Signal still works.  So I have a workaround for my problem, but there's still a bug that probably only users brave enough to read Java Exception traces figure out how to work around.   ### Device info **Device:** ONEPLUS A3000 **Android version:** 9 **Signal version:** 4.66.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/acc6cb088a29b740e3d3f3379f7518a09a0f9258e8c174909cf128e728193898","closed","wontfix,","samuelgruetter","2020-07-19T15:44:09Z","2022-02-03T23:41:08Z"

I go through the set up. Everything goes well. Eventually there is a banner asking me to disable battery optimizations and what not. I click on the X. For a few hours Signal works perfectly, without battery drain. Notifications are sometimes delayed but that's ok.  Then, after checking Signal some random time, it decides to start a notification with ""Background connection enabled"" and a huge battery drain (reported dozens of times in the last years) starts.  There is no way to disable background connection. Turning all notifications off does not disable it either (why?).  When trying to enable battery optimizations, it says `Battery optimization not available`.  ### Steps to reproduce - Setup signal - Use it normally for a while - At some point it decides it should use persistent connection  **Actual result:** Persistent connection is enabled without asking, cannot be disabled, battery optimizations cannot be enabled.  **Expected result:** Persistent connection should not be enabled unless the user opts-in. Persistent connection should be disabled when notifications are turned off. Battery optimizations should be available to be enabled so that the app can be put to sleep by the OS.   ### Device info  **Device:** Google Pixel 3 **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.53.6  ### Link to debug log  There is nothing special in the debug log.

Signal was taking 70MB in /data/app/org.thoughtcrime.securesms-1. It downloaded its update apk to /data/media/0/Android/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms/files which was another 70MB, and those two together, plus the unpacking during the installation process, failed the install. My phone is decent but it's not a flagship device: I have about 250MB free on my phone at all times, which is a fairly generous reserve given the hardware.  For about a year now I've been having to wipe my Signal .mms files and clear out my synced emails and double-check for photos to offload every time a new Signal update comes in because the temporary spike in storage usage that comes during the install would often make it fail with Android's obscure ""App Not Installed"" error. But this time I additionally *had to move the APK to my external SD card* to make room. When I finally did get update installed the /data/app part is now 100MB -- or fully 5% of my available storage.  I wonder what got added in the last month that took 30MB? Was it the face detector?  If Signal keeps growing in size I am going to have to stop using it, and so will anyone who is running on used/budget phones.  For comparison, Discord is 110MB. WhatsApp is 55MB. Conversations is 30MB, and that's only after a big update that added VoIP (previously it was 12MB).  ### Steps to reproduce  - wait for the Signal update notification to come - click the notification - sometimes: immediately get ""App Not Installed"", - sometimes: the APK is pre-unpacked and I can press ""Install"", but then I get ""Out of space: Manage Space?""  **Actual result:** Signal fails to install. **Expected result:** Signal should install.  ### Screenshots   ![signal-2020-06-26-234649](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/987487/85914053-09b00080-b808-11ea-8fd1-e2127eab0c1b.png)  (I missed getting a screenshot of the update notification or the install failing, but I'm sure I'll get it again in a few days when the next update comes)  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto E (condor) **Android version:** 7.1.2 **Signal version:** 4.64.7  ### Thanks  Also, let me say that I really do appreciate the work you've done to get encryption in the hands of regular folks.

And also all my contacts (if they didn't mess with their backup) have a shit-load of private data from me.  I'm pretty sure that far more than 98% of the data that is older than 15 months is no longer useful in any case for one of the communication participants. So their isn't any justification that this data still exists.   Disappearing message don't work, because they do not function retroactively. This is important because: * Relationships between people change, so my data retention policy with these people change. * People are becoming more political and are therefore more in the focus of authorities. * People move/visit to country with laws that force them to enter passwords.  Disappearing message time frame is to short for a lot of cases, e.g. * Working together with people, e.g. what was the solution we agreed upon 3 weeks ago? * What was his private address that he sent me 1 month ago when we agreed that I would visit him? * I know we had this issue at the event last year, we chatted about it.  There are many more cases I can think of.  It is realy hard to think of good values for all of my contacts, but 1week is in almose all cases to short and infinite is definitv to long in all cases. It whould be good if it's posible that all messages disapear (retroactively) after 3, 6, 12 or 18 month depends on contact or group.  ### Steps to reproduce - Using signal with contacts for a long time period - The data collected over the years gets into the wrong hands   - Some contacts maybe lost their phone without any good protection   - Some contacts maybe get forced by authority's to enter their passwords    - Crypto breaks after some years   - ... feel free to think about the many other options - The privacy was injured more than could be justified  **Actual result:** All my chat content stay forever (except my contacts mess with their backup) **Expected result:** All my chat content disappears after a reasonable long time   Related #6219 #6814 #6197 #7324","closed","","martin-v","2020-07-15T12:19:39Z","2020-07-15T13:49:58Z"

I'm not entirely sure what to expect of the chat between (1) and (2), to put it in a chat with the number of (2) would probably give issues.  ### Device info **Device: 1** Sony Z3 Compact **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.64.7  **Device: 2** Sony Z3 Compact **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.64.7","closed","","johanw666","2020-06-26T12:15:50Z","2020-06-26T13:49:03Z"

Installed Signal year 2017 on Android 7 (LineAgeOS 14.1). Signal was still working after upgrading to Android 9, which I did 1-2 months ago (during summer 2020). Then suddenly Signal worked perfectly one evening but stopped working next morning. No updates was made during that time.  I have installed updates to Signal app after this but it still crashes.  Signal seems to work fine after clearing app data (backed up with Titanium Backup first and restored data after testing).  #### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S5  **Android version:** LineAgeOS 16.0 (Android 9)  **Signal version:** 4.69.4.69410  #### Debug log  ``` 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime: Process: org.thoughtcrime.securesms, PID: 18762 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.AssertionError: javax.crypto.AEADBadTagException 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.KeyStoreHelper.unseal(KeyStoreHelper.java:75) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.logging.LogSecretProvider.parseEncryptedSecret(LogSecretProvider.java:36) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.logging.LogSecretProvider.getOrCreateAttachmentSecret(LogSecretProvider.java:21) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.logging.PersistentLogger.(PersistentLogger.java:51) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ApplicationContext.initializeLogging(ApplicationContext.java:217) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ApplicationContext.onCreate(ApplicationContext.java:111) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.app.Instrumentation.callApplicationOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1154) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.app.ActivityThread.handleBindApplication(ActivityThread.java:5920) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at com.elderdrivers.riru.edxp._hooker.yahfa.HandleBindAppHooker.hook(HandleBindAppHooker.java:21) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.app.ActivityThread.access$1100(ActivityThread.java:200) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1656) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:106) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:193) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6718) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(RuntimeInit.java:491) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:858) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: javax.crypto.AEADBadTagException 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.security.keystore.AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.engineDoFinal(AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.java:517) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at javax.crypto.Cipher.doFinal(Cipher.java:2055) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at org.thoughtcrime.securesms.crypto.KeyStoreHelper.unseal(KeyStoreHelper.java:73) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        ... 16 more 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: android.security.KeyStoreException: Signature/MAC verification failed 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.security.KeyStore.getKeyStoreException(KeyStore.java:850) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.security.keystore.KeyStoreCryptoOperationChunkedStreamer.doFinal(KeyStoreCryptoOperationChunkedStreamer.java:224) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.security.keystore.AndroidKeyStoreAuthenticatedAESCipherSpi$BufferAllOutputUntilDoFinalStreamer.doFinal(AndroidKeyStoreAuthenticatedAESCipherSpi.java:373) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        at android.security.keystore.AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.engineDoFinal(AndroidKeyStoreCipherSpiBase.java:506) 08-20 22:03:22.085 18762 18762 E AndroidRuntime:        ... 18 more ```  #### Question  Is there any chance of me restoring my data?

Since then, when I save some images to my phone's memory, the respective files don't show up in Google's ""Files"" app. They are actually stored in the memory (e. g. accessible via MTP), but I can't access them anymore using ""Files"".  Also, if I try to attach such a downloaded file to a Signal message, I can't select it, it also doesn't show up from inside Signal.

The message will be shown as loading, but the process of sending seems to stall. I am only experiencing this when I am using a Wi-Fi network, sending attachments via mobile data network works fine without any issues.   When I switch to a mobile data network during uploading, the message will be sent quickly. Interestingly, sending text messages (without any file attached) works completely fine when sent via Wi-Fi.  This error does not come up all the time, this rather seems to be an issue with some contacts only. Unfortunately, I could not find out why specifically...  ### Steps to Reproduce    1.  Select a conversation from the list and/or your contacts 2.  Connect to a Wi-Fi network (and turn off mobile data) 3.  Add an attachment to the message 4.  Send the message 5.  (Deactivate Wi-Fi network and connect to mobile data network)  Actual Result:  Sending the message/attachment will not start or stall before starting. The problem persists, waiting does not solve it.  Expected Result:  The message, including the attachments, should be sent immediately, no matter what network you are connected too (as long as your network is properly connected to the internet).    ### Platform Info  Signal Version: 4.53.6    Operating System: LineageOS 16.0 (Android 9)    Linked Device Version: LineageOS 16.0-20200108-NIGHTLY-a5y17lte    ### Link to Debug Log  https://debuglogs.org/7044813054e2cd9f508d6c84b25fd76af65e756c060183cabe5f0b681135c199","closed","wontfix,","Currrupted","2020-01-17T00:11:21Z","2022-02-04T07:38:28Z"

It's fine that buttons take up more width, but there needs to be a visual indication that more buttons are available.  ### Steps to reproduce - Set the app to Dutch - Open any conversation - Press the attachment button  **Actual result:** On most screens you won't be seeing the location share option. Only if you try to side scroll on the options do you notice you can share location as well.  **Expected result:** There is some kind of visual indicator (an arrow to the right, a scroll bar or the right side is somewhat blurred) to visually indicate that there are more options if you scroll to the side.  ### Screenshots ![d18e2b1f427ea5d1b398a0922e6307a9fff4e803](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34976212/83528917-f8662380-a4e9-11ea-9c4c-574a18042689.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Motorola Moto G7 Plus among others **Android version:** 10.0 among others **Signal version:** 4.60.7 among others  This was originally a support request on the community forum: https://community.signalusers.org/t/location-sharing-button-not-visible-dutch-signal-android/14577 I am reporting this as a design oversight, aka design bug. One could call it a feature request, but I guess it is within reason to expect existing buttons to be displayed to the user correctly, in that sense this is a bug.

Could be related to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/1115, but since here its Android without the use of a Desktop Client (The other devices in the groups we don't know...) we decided to open a new issue.  ### Steps to reproduce We didn't try to reproduce this behavior but still wanna say the steps - old phone broke, so no deinstallation or logout possible - installed and activated signal on a new phone  **Actual result:** Receiving and being able to write to several groups left months ago.

When recovering a backup, the datetime is sometimes shorted to for example ""Mon 00:24"". This can however lead to the question ""Was this last Monday or just a Monday?"" This matters when making a choice whether you want to restore the backup or not. The solution is very simple: always show a full datetime with day, month year and time, even if the backup was made this week. This removes any ambiguity.  Edit: and let me also mention that the datetime currently isn't being localized, and shows in English despite another language being configured. ### Device info **Signal version:** 4.56.1","closed","wontfix,","Meteor0id","2020-02-18T00:45:18Z","2022-02-03T23:40:43Z"

I transferred the backup file to a new phone (where my SIM-card, from the old phone was already active). On the new phone (Nokia 4.2) I installed Signal from the Play Store. Signal detected the backup and asked for the passphrase (6x5 digits). The passphrase was accepted and Signal started importing the backup. For some reason Signal crashed. I tried again (I forgot what I exactly did) and in the end Signal was trying to register without that the backup had been restored. I uninstalled Signal, and did the whole procedure again, closely monitoring the import process. This time the import went well (the phone was not locked during the import process, during the first attempt it was locked).  I see several stack traces in the [debug log](https://debuglogs.org/3ce354812f70f235b352486c32d4ed68b940667cda56fbbb9fb5899f029dbd9a).  The size of the backup file is 5.7G. I am a long term Signal (TextSecure) user, so maybe the database contains old style information. For some parts of the import the message count of imported messages went very quickly, for other parts very slow. The slow part was around message 125,000 to 129,000. After this thousands of messages were very quickly imported. It went so quick that I could not write down the final number of messages imported. But I guess it will be around 150,000 messages.  During the time that I was doing the migration the old phone was in flight mode all the time. However, I did receive and send messages with Signal desktop. These messages, sent by Signal desktop were not loaded on the new phone, when it came online. So they seem to be lost for the Signal database on the new phone.  My old phone is still in flight mode (with Signal installed). I did not want to take the risk to break the Signal setup on the new phone, and desktops by bringing it online again. I'm wondering whether it would load the messages that I miss on the new phone, but that I do have on Signal desktop. If you would like, I could enable networking on the old phone again to test.  ### Device info ========= SYSINFO ========= Time         : 1596278005309 Manufacturer : HMD Global Model        : Nokia 4.2 Product      : Panther_00EEA Screen       : 720x1370, xhdpi (300), 60.00 hz Font Scale   : 1.0 Android      : 10 (00EEA_2_29C, 00EEA_2_290_SP03) ABIs         : arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, armeabi Memory       : 43M (44.13% free, 512M max) Memclass     : 192 OS Host      : R740 Censored     : false Play Services: true FCM          : true First Version: 680 App          : Signal 4.67.3 (6802) Package      : org.thoughtcrime.securesms (doDiFGKPO1r)  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/3ce354812f70f235b352486c32d4ed68b940667cda56fbbb9fb5899f029dbd9a","closed","wontfix,","janvlug","2020-08-01T10:58:27Z","2022-01-27T20:26:02Z"

Long awaited and happy to test it :+1:   When making a video call between the desktop client and a phone, these are the issues that popped up. I don't know if they're all related or should be separated...  **Big delay / a lot of latency**  When speaking, the latency was much larger than with other software. Both callers were in the same building.  **Potrait to landscape doesn't flip on desktop**  When the android user switched from potrait to landscape, the desktop kept the image in portrait mode.  **video keeps jumping (frame drops)**  Every few second the video would slow down and suddenly speed up or simply jump and catch up.  ### Steps to Reproduce    1.  Start calling using desktop client 2.  Accept call in portrait on android 3.  Talk a while 4. (optional) flip phone to landscape  Actual Result:  Described above  Expected Result:  - lower latency - no frame jumps - flip image from portrait to landscape  ### Screenshots  I guess only the portrait -> landscape can have screenshots.

By setting the phone's time to something in the past, you can cause new messages to appear as though they arrived prior to older ones.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send a Signal text message to a friend. - In your phone's settings, use manual time and date instead of getting from the network. - Set the current time to something in the past.  **Actual result:** Return to the same conversation as above. Send another text message. Observe that the new message gets inserted prior to the previous message.  **Expected result:** One could argue that the observed behavior is in fact correct because you made it look as though the phone went backwards in time. This issue might be fixed by manually changing timezones, so that UTC continues to advance monotonically. But perhaps the previous time was actually wrong, so you're trying to correct it. In any event, Signal's behavior is wrong (and it _knows_ it's wrong) because local time must be monotonic as well. So, while Signal has no idea what the wall clock time actually is, it knows that later messages must be ordered after earlier ones, so in no event is it appropriate to insert new ones at a prior place in the history. There needs to be a notion of sequence which overrides the notion of alleged wall clock time, even if that means that the timestamps displayed in the history can go backwards. (Fixing this also requires some consideration of what the message timestamp means, anyway. Is it the sender's untrusted assertion of time? Or the receiver's supposed time upon receipt? Or do we need to stop displaying timestamps because alleged wall clock time is not guaranteed to be monotonic?)  ### Screenshots N/A  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung S11 **Android version:** (latest) **Signal version:** (latest)  ### Link to debug log N/A","closed","wontfix,","sailbird","2020-06-18T01:05:52Z","2022-02-03T22:40:51Z"

He already has Signal installed and has registered his phone number, but may or may not have used it yet. (I'm not sure if it matters.) Now you want to message him, so you hit the ""compose"" icon (which, by the way, lots of people can't identify because they're too dumb to take the hint from the ""pencil"" icon). Anyway, you try to find his name in your Signal contacts, but he's not there. So then you need to enter ""+"" (which said dumb people also can't find or don't understand) followed by his country code and phone number. Signal might have had hours since the contact was created, but it just doesn't pick it up as ""Joe"" until after you send the first message to him. Maybe you don't want to hook the contract creation event (or can't). Maybe you don't want to constantly poll for changes. But surely there's a way to at least mostly eliminate this problem?  ### Steps to reproduce (As above.)  **Actual result:** ""Joe"" doesn't show up, so you need to enter his number manually for the first message to him.  **Expected result:** Insert ""Joe"" at the proper alphabetic place in the contact list that pops up when I hit the ""compose"" icon. Even saying ""wait while I detect new contacts"" or ""tap here to refresh contact list from Signal servers"" would be a tremendous improvement.

(I realize that this can be disabled, but it's enabled by default, which I think is a security vulnerability because it constitutes default to unsafe behavior.)  Now you've informed YouTube that such-and-such IP address has mentioned a specific video. If the link preview is going through Signal servers, then you're informing Signal directly and YouTube indirectly, which is probably safer, but still problematic. It's also unclear what happens if the receiver disables link previews but the sender doesn't, or visa versa. It's clear that sender and receiver are communicating because their IPs point to each other during voice calls. So now, one party leaks a particular video, then by implication, it might also be of interest to the other. So I could associate you with narcotics crime by spamming you with videos about drug smuggling, for example. There are so many ways this could go wrong. Why is it enabled by default?  ### Steps to reproduce Get your friend to send you a link to a YouTube video (or perhaps some other popular third party content).  **Actual result:** Describe here what happens after you run the steps above (i.e. the buggy behaviour) You get a preview of the content, such as a video thumbnail, which could only have been fetched from a third party.  **Expected result:** Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above (i.e. what would be the correct behaviour) Generally, do nothing other than send the link. At most, make this an opt-in feature.

Similar isses have been already reported ([#7429](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/7429), [#3332](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/3332l), [#4134](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/4134)), but everytime, the Desktop client was involved.  In this case, everybody participating used the Signal Android client currently available on Google Play (4.58.5) only. This is not the Desktop Client issue!  Some messages were not received by one participant. Additionally, some messages on the phone of the participant with the missing messages were displayed in wrong order.  ### Steps to reproduce This seems to be hard to reproduce. We couldn't figure out a pattern, this seems to happen randomly. But, as long as this chat lasted, multiple messages weren't delivered to one participant and others were in wrong order. They also didn't appear later (until now, about 10 hours later).  ### Screenshots Here's a side-by-side screenshot of a part of the chat. On the left side, it's my Nokia 4.2, running Android 9 (it actually only displays ""9""!) with the correct order and all messages. On the right, it's my wife's Samsung Galaxy A3 2017, running Android 8.0.0. You can both see missing messages (on one reply with a cited message, there's even an ""Original message not found"" error displayed!) and messages in wrong order: ![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6770781/80909062-74235380-8d25-11ea-8c98-56ddb4a77ddf.jpg)  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.58.5  It seems to be hard to catch hold of this.

Github will also convert it to an hyperlink, this is in itself unsafe behavior and likely another bug):  www.innofensiveLinknot￰Malicious.com   - Send the message containing the malicious URL to the victim using the Signal-Desktop client (victim must be using the Signal-Android client). This is important, as the Signal-Android client will sanitize the link before sending it, but Signal-Desktop will not. All Signal clients for Android will detect the unicode u+FFF0 and wont convert the URL to hyperlink, but the string after the unicode character ""malicious.com"" will still be recognized as a hyperlink. Signal will then show a notification for the whole ""www.innofensiveLinknotMalicious.com"" and a button to open the link.  -  When you press the notification button, the user will open the link ""malicious.com"" in the browser, instead of ""www.innofensiveLinknot￰Malicious.com""  **Actual result:** Sending a specially crafted URL the user will be asked to open ""www.innofensiveLinknot￰Malicious.com"" but instead the link ""Malicious.com"" will be opened.  **Expected result:** The user opens the link ""www.innofensiveLinknot￰Malicious.com""   ### Screenshots  ![index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1576696/95527651-4d400c00-09ac-11eb-9fb5-048a072ef1d2.jpeg) ![index2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1576696/95527662-58933780-09ac-11eb-83f4-a2f297ee2005.jpeg)   ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung S10 **Android version:** 10.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.71.5  ### Additional info  Using this technique you can cut links in several parts, for example:  www.g￰oogle.co￰m  This malicious link will open ""oogle.co"" in the Signal-Android message notification dialog.","closed","","ortegaalfredo","2020-10-09T00:24:47Z","2020-10-26T20:19:29Z"

Contacts without Signal aren't listet in my Signal app, can't change that. I don't use Hangouts/Project Fi, no other (besides the Android default SMS App) that can read/write SMS are installed.  Doesn't seem to be related to https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5044  ### Steps to reproduce * Upgrade to Lineageos 17 (Android 10) with installed Signal App. * Go to Signal settings, see that Signal is NOT the default SMS App. * Go to Android Permission settings - Signal is the default App there.  **Actual result:**  Signal dosen't send SMS any more, and can't be made the default SMS app on Android 10.  **Expected result:** It should do as before: send SMS to non-Signal contacts. It should be able to recognize that it IS the default SMS app.  ### Screenshots In Android settings Signal is the default SMS app:  ![Screenshot_20200420-090328_Berechtigungssteuerung](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2955584/79723434-09662700-82e6-11ea-98a5-acc5e44e1ce1.png)  But in Signal settings, this is not respected.   ![Screenshot_20200420-085939_Signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2955584/79723179-9ceb2800-82e5-11ea-9cf2-e4990981e13e.png)  ### Device info  **Device:** Oneplus 3 **Android version:** 10 (lineage_oneplus3-userdebug 10 QQ2A, 200405.005 a3bfd141c1 **Signal version:** 4.58.5  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/ec86d32ae068fac52cf3e52ce02cd0081ca8ad980dab7a2ac6b6787cafbeec08  Excerpt: * android.permission.WRITE_SMS: YES * org.thoughtcrime.securesms.ACCESS_SECRETS: YES","closed","wontfix,","nerdoc","2020-04-20T07:16:26Z","2022-04-08T12:16:36Z"

Every time I try, it says  ""An item has been removed because it exceeded the space limits"" and cancels the attachment. I know this is not a problem with my service provider (republic wireless) because other texting apps can still send videos/gif with no problems, and also not a problem with my phone (which is running the latest version of Android 9). Is anyone else experiencing this problem? I have repeatedly reached out over the past few months to the signal support email to try and get help, but have never gotten a response.  Not even sure if this is the right place either. Posting this here as a last-chance Hail Mary. This bug is really impacting my usage of the signal app. As much as I love the security, I NEED to be able to send videos for my job.   ### Steps to reproduce - try to attach any video (size not matter) or gif (bigger than 1mb) to any signal text message. - Get Error message: ""An item has been removed because it exceeded the space limits"" and cancels the attachment.""  Happens every time without fail.

After a lot of testing I have found that notifications work when using a mobile data connection, but not when connected to wifi. I have thouroughly checked my wifi setup and i have found nothing that could cause such a problem. I have observed the same problem when on other wifi networks.  I have gone through all settings in the support page for notification troubleshooting signal on android   The recommended settings are applied.  The problem occurred several updates back. Dont know the last signal version that worked.    ### Steps to reproduce - Connect phone to wifi network - send a signal message from another device. - No notification. Start the signal appp and the notification and message is received  - Turn of wifi in the phone, leaving mobile data connection on. - close signal app - send a signal message from another device - Notification is received. - Open signal and read message.   **Actual result:**  No notifications when phone is connected to wifi.  **Expected result:**  I would expect notifications to be received  when connected to wifi  ### Device info  **Device:** Huawei mate 20 pro **Android version:** 10 **Signal version:** 4.53.5  ### Link to debug log","closed","wontfix,","bitwit42","2020-01-14T10:37:01Z","2022-02-04T02:04:01Z"

There is no indication that a new message has been received. You basically have to open Signal to check for new messages (kind of like opening your email account to check for new emails.)  When opening Signal, the new messages and notifications are received all at once.  This generally happens when Signal hasn't been used for a while. Once we start using Signal again, the notifications work OK. Until... we don't use Signal again for a while, then the notifications stop working again.  So you end up messaging someone on Signal, and then alerting them by SMS or email to check their Signal messages.  This is happening to 5 people I know who are using Signal all on different devices. The fact is that no one would else would report this bug here, most people just use alternative messaging apps instead eg. Whatsapp.   I fear that this bug is really hurting Signal messenger.  ### Steps to reproduce - Someone sends a signal message  **Actual result:** No new message notification is received - no sounds, no vibration, no lights, nothing. There is not even an indication on the App Icon, nothing to tell them that a new Signal message has been received.  **Expected result:** Phone should make a sound, vibrate, turn on the new message light or at the very least show an indication on the App Icon that a new Signal message has been received.  ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S4 **Android version:** 6.0.1 **Signal version:** 4.57.2  ### Device info **Device:** Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini **Android version:** 4.4.4 **Signal version:** 4.57.2  ### Device info **Device:** Redmi Note ? **Android version:** ??? **Signal version:** 4.57.2","closed","","osmgit","2020-04-08T23:09:56Z","2020-05-10T05:09:05Z"

Never faced such an issue with years of use of signal. Faced delays, due to obfuscation/circumvention, due to country I am located in.  Bug started on October 6. Certain messages are not being sent. Getting the rotating (sending) circle indefinitely. Those messages are: 1. Attachments (of any type or size) 2. Quoted replies After 24 hours, I receive a ""failure"" to send message.  **Important to note:** - Quoted replies sometimes get sent. - Attachments never go through. - Receiving all message types with no issue.   This is probably a similar case: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10070 But missing log file, and much info, hence the repost.  ### Steps to reproduce - Send attached or quoted reply - Attachment/quoted reply keeps trying to be sent - Message gives a ""failure to send"" error after 24 hours of trying  **Actual result:** Messages are not being sent. Endless ""sending"". **Expected result:** Messages would be sent immediately.    ### Screenshots   ### Device info **Device:** Pixel 3 (blueline) **Android version:** 11 (6720564, RP1A.200720.009) **Signal version:** 4.72.5 Signal package: org.thoughtcrime.securesms (doDiFGKPO1r) Registration lock: false Locale: en_US  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/76ad9e7af7ca911485e09fca3af8090d4b1dad17f2cb129fc04788657824e698","closed","","mfmansour","2020-10-09T18:10:23Z","2020-10-15T15:30:34Z"

We talking about 40-50 sec for one Message to get send and it only gets slower. If you send multiple Messages after the first one, it can take up to multiple Minutes till they get send. Receiving Messages takes ~10-15 sec. Short Chats dont seem to be affected. Its the most brutal if the other Person is writing/answering at the same time as your Message sends. Signal gets really laggy, the phone gets hot and slow, till anything is sent. Not related to this, but maybe Interesting: Backups take around 3 hours to finish. Backupfile is around 7GB in Size.  ### Steps to reproduce - Open Signal - Go to Chat with long History (opening and closing that Chat is also really slow) - Send one or Multiple Messages  **Actual result:** Messages take sometimes Minutes to Send. **Expected result:** Messages should be send almost instant, like in a fresh Chat.  ### Device info  **Device:** Galaxy S5 klte / SM-G900F and One Plus 6T **Android version:** 9.0 LineageOS 16 / Stock Rom **Signal version:** 4.68.8, persists in 4.69.6, persists in 4.70.3, persists in 4.70.5, persists in 5.8.10, solved in 5.20.4  ### Link to debug log   https://debuglogs.org/fff230b9173168bd607d678f019b51b7dc38c12ced3661f169c51e1968b147d8  EDIT: New Log, while sending and receiving Messages at the same time:  https://debuglogs.org/7eead199b7af5be480058d38b128f766cf4536beb0be0b4a24aa2ad962aada09  EDIT2: Now (28th Aug) the Problem is so bad, that the App gets nearly unusable. Messages take around 90 Seconds to get send. Only in that one, long Chat. As long as one Message in that Chat is sending, anything else is almost not responding and the App locks up sometimes. Even receiving Messages in that Chat is so slow, that sometimes the Person thinks i lost connection or turned off my Phone. Isnt there anything that can be done, without loosing all the History ? I used Whatsapp for some time before and had Chats with around 30-40k Messages and NEVER had any Problems like that, why is it, that Signal has such poor Performance ?  EDIT3 (4th Nov): Time to send one Message went up to ~130 secs. Pics dont always send. Just the Text under them. App is barely usable whenever i access a long Chat.  EDIT4 (Feb 2021): Changed Phone from a Galaxy S5 with Snapdragon 801 and 2GB RAM, to a One Plus 6T with Snapdragon 845 and 8GB RAM. Problem still persists, but is better thanks to more Raw Power. Chat still gets slower every Day, even tho not as noticeable anymore, probably also thanks to more power.  EDIT5 (18th Aug 2021): Problem seems resolved. Performance in a long Chat is drastically Improved with Version 5.20.4. A Message takes around 2-3 seconds now, which i consider ""instant"".

The size of the backup file is: 4.1GB.   These storage numbers are confusing, especially the first two.   Why is Signal reported storage 3.1GB and Android storage for Signal 6.8GB?

I knowSignal changed the type of access to the address book. But I know also that other Dalvik users have no problems like that.  **Actual result:** Phone numers are shown instead the username in the chat list. But in the Memberlist of a Group chat or in the Overview of the reactionbar the username are shown correctly. **Expected result:** Usernames will shown correctly erverywhere.  ### Screenshots  Part of my contact-List: show only phone numbers ![contact2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61382908/77227852-54740980-6b83-11ea-90d4-216b1c1c9c0e.png)  Part of a chatgroup-list: show Contact names ![contact3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61382908/77227808-25f62e80-6b83-11ea-8e79-b68ae7d9a419.jpg)  Overview of the Reaction bar: show contact names. ![contact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61382908/77227919-f98ee200-6b83-11ea-8f1e-d71806508b22.jpg)  ### Device info  **Device:** Sony Xperia XA2 **Android version:** 8.1 **Signal version:** 4.57.2  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/b38ca5ce19443e40a10bd3a78576a664e0176b5284a20c6683a4389382eb5861","closed","","wheelseal","2020-03-21T14:03:09Z","2020-03-21T19:28:19Z"
"","9861","[SOLVED] Signal doesn't add itself as account in Settings/ Accounts and can't be added either (greyed out) -> no contacts","**SOLUTION** see [my post below](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/9861#issuecomment-664689160)!  ### Pre-requisites - Installed Signal version: latest 4.66.5; also tried latest Beta + several older versions - verified my number successfully via received SMS code - granted Signal all three permissions requested during 1st launch and also verified them afterwards  ### Bug description see issue title + screenshots below. When I tap onto the greyed-out Signal entry, nothing happens. However, when I tap onto some other greyed-out app, it **_does_** get added into the active accounts section one level higher. So the general functionality to add an app account is working!  Consequently the contact list is empty, and does not refresh when I tap the blue/white pencil button and swipe down or tap refresh. I can however receive messages from someone in my Google contacts, but these people only appear with their phone number + avatar, not their name.  ### Steps to reproduce/ narrow down Here's what I so far tried in vain, resulting in the exact same error: 	- unregistered my phone # in Signal settings, re-registered via SMS code 	- uninstalled Signal again, rebooted, reinstalled 	- set Signal to also be default SMS app 	- registered with a different phone # (my landline) 	- reset/ deleted cache & dalvik cache via TWRP 	- on my tablet which uses the same Google account, registered my phone's #  -> entered SMS code from my phone -> OK on the tablet, Signal appears under Android Settings/ Accounts and all contacts who use Signal show up 	 ### Screenshots  ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39203497/87826870-efeb6180-c879-11ea-8c74-0584fbdd2ade.jpg)  ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39203497/87826936-10b3b700-c87a-11ea-9a7c-bad086902d98.png)  ### Preliminary assumption of reason for bug some inconsistency (internal permissions wrong or missing?) in the Signal app or in my phone's Android  ### Device info Phone: Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 J510FN DUOS (dual SIM) | ARMv7 (v7l) Cortex-A53 4 x 1.2 GHz Android: 7.1.1 ""Nougat"" Samsung Experience 8.5 (TouchWiz) custom ROM 	NOTE: Signal worked before perfectly with this exact same ROM and the same phone #!! rooted: yes, via latest Magisk Xposed: yes, but same issue with Xposed disabled TWRP: yes  ### Link to debug log https://debuglogs.org/dfb3a2281cf986df3dd0bb54a84c4987eda3d268e4495c0595c5e169a0e0278b  **I can run commands in terminal so don't hesitate to throw any such commands at me :)**","closed","","LeeBinder","2020-07-17T20:22:00Z","2020-07-28T20:38:47Z"

After a while the whole app closed, shutting of the video and ending the call. It might have been the internet connection, but I had good reception. If I remember correctly, usually there's this ""hanging up"" sound when the call is ended. But it wasn't there this time. So, maybe it was the internet connection or it crashed.

My phone is over heating because of signals last update. When will there we a fix anytime soon?  My phone says “Apps are over loading the cpu.” 25% on signal… My phone is getting way to hot! and draining my battery like crazy. Phone: Samsung Galaxy 7)  - A few weeks ago, posted here:  https://community.signalusers.org/t/overheating-phone-after-update-on-2020-06-05/14764  Edit: Just updated my phone last night, fixed most of over heating but is still warm and so what hot. All Problems with Signal with the LASTEST UPDATE: - 1 Messages are slow and don’t receive them right away. (Delayed) MAX of 7 Mins Delayed I have ever seen. - 2 Calls don’t pop up when someone is calling you. There is no indication that someone is calling what’s so ever. ONLY on Android (Months of this being broken, not joking) Says Connecting on ios but never rings on when trying to call the Android phone. ios to Android. NOT - Android to ios. (Incoming calls ios calling to Android) (Using Android) - 3 After a call fails you don’t see a pop up (somewhat like 2 but different), you don’t even see a notification message at all. - 4 Video calls over heating the phone now. Check the over heating problem again because its not fixed fully ever after the update fix it somewhat, not fixed. - 5 Normal Calls leave your phone warm/ some what hot. (They fixed the overheating somewhat from the update last night but my phone is still getting warm without even charging it and I need to charge it…) I don’t want my phone to hurt itself when charging and leaving it signal on. The phone starts to get warm/hot again with charging and signal on.  - 2 Picture Proof: This is the only thing you get after call fails (When someone is trying to call you get no notification message at all but this in the app it self.) fix this https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/2X/9/91f29b810d4f5687b077df3a533adbc6e6a940af.jpeg  These things need to get fixed because I am done using this app until its fixed. There is so many bugs and I can’t quite be on a call without these bugs pissing me off everyday! Please do something soon.  Mr. Waste  Edit: - 6 I forgot to share 1 more bug I have ran into is when signal is running on a call. It uses my mobile data and not the wifi even tho I have wifi connected, it still uses my mobile data by default and calls lag because of being in door of my house.

I have signal on in the background and drains my battery faster than it should. I'm not even on call or texting. The phone screen is off. Lineageos. To this day I still don't why it drains so fast. Got more phones since then. Still has the same problem with all these phones.

Calling from my iPhone to the Android Phone. ### Steps to reproduce -  Start a Video Call and wait about 15-30 mins it starts to get really hot/ too warm for the phone - 1 Hour later the phone is dieing because how hot it is and yes the screen brightness is at 30% of 100% and drains the battery FAST because of overheating!!  **Actual result:** Phone is dieing because of the heat and if you don't stop video calling it will start to lag and shut the phone off after 1.3 hours because of it. The heat is going to kill the phone!!! **Expected result:** The heat is going to kill the phone!!!  ### Screenshots    ### Device info  **Device:** Samsung +10s && Samsung +9s && Samsung Galaxy 7s **Android version:** 8.0.0 **Signal version:** 4.64.7  ### Link to debug log  https://debuglogs.org/f2e82abcc7d9aa470299a1c12bc71ea8d6694aff4dc012803ca6431a3efdbf7b https://debuglogs.org/69a7dcaff3f58d44cc67fffdbafe19b2d1ed2e951bac4dd9b1c74e23b76ec470 Please let me know if the Debug Logs even work, they are a few weeks old but still show the problems.

Adds unicode wildcards for equivalent latin characters","### First time contributor checklist - [x] I have read [how to contribute](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this project - [x] I have signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://whispersystems.org/cla/)  ### Contributor checklist - [x] I am following the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines) - [x] I have tested my contribution on these devices:  * Xiaomi Mi 9 Lite, Android 9 - [x] My contribution is fully baked and ready to be merged as is - [x] I ensure that all the open issues my contribution fixes are mentioned in the commit message of my first commit using the `Fixes #1234` [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)  ----------  ### Description  So in PR #9692 the key point I was trying to address was that accentuated char should be considered when typing unaccentuated chars when searching for a name (eg. ""eric"" should return [""Éric"", ""Albéric""]). Right now, even with commit 5bf15b0, the search function is hardly usable in french and many other accentuated languages.  @greyson-signal pointed out that my solution was limited to a very narrow subset of unicode. That was very true, at that time I focused only on baguette-eating accentuated characters.  I understand that Signal is used everywhere around the world so here is an improved version of the proposal that matches similar characters from the following unicode blocks : * [Latin-1 Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block)) * [Latin Extended-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-A) * [Latin Extended-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-B) * [Latin Extended Additional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended_Additional)  to achieve that result, I make an extensive use of regex with hand-picked character ranges. It was a soul crushing task, 0/5 do not recommend.  ![screenshot-signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560197/99277390-0b697780-282e-11eb-9e9b-3ba1d1039637.jpg)","closed","","Karalix","2020-11-16T16:04:32Z","2021-04-20T15:43:59Z"

When verifying the account, the uuid is not set yet and this causes the app to crash when it tries to generate a notification for the received SMS, thus I disabled notifications for received SMS messages when we are are still verifying. Registering the account sets the uuid, but this requires the SMS to be received. Receiving this registration SMS was previously done in the `RegistrationNavigationActivity` using an `SmsRetriever` filtering on the `SMS_RETRIEVED_ACTION`. However, when Signal already is the default SMS app, I noticed that the `SmsRetriever` did not trigger, but that a `SmsReceiveJob` was registered. Thus, I factored out the functionality for processing a registration SMS, made the `SmsRetriever` use it and made the `SmsReceiveJob` use the function when it receives an SMS while registering.  I followed the steps to reproduce #9417 and verified that the app did not crash, registered and was able to exchange messages with other users. I then uninstalled the app, and registered as usual (with Signal not being the default SMS app). Now, I did receive the registration SMS, but the code was not filled in automatically. However, the auto-fill seems to only work when installing from the Playstore, so I'm not sure if the refactoring the `SmsReceiveJob` to handle registration SMS messages was neccesary.","closed","wontfix,","martijnvandenhoek","2020-04-09T09:14:35Z","2022-02-02T05:09:15Z"

A voice message of 30 minutes has taken ~112sec on stock Signal, ~160sec with self-built Signal. The cause was the frequent iterative use of extractor.advance(), which seems to be no problem with other devices. Instead of extractor.advance() to go through each frame, seekTo(...) is used to go directly to the desired frame whose values are to be used for the audio hash. Two further values were used for this: BAR_FACTOR and barTimer. BAR_FACTOR contains the time difference between the desired frames. barTimer contains the time of the actual frame.

A voice message of 30 minutes has taken ~112sec on stock Signal, ~160sec with self-built Signal. The cause was the frequent iterative use of extractor.advance(), which seems to be no problem with other devices. Instead of extractor.advance() to go through each frame, seekTo(...) is used to go directly to the desired frame whose values are to be used for the audio hash. Two further values were used for this: BAR_FACTOR and barTimer. BAR_FACTOR contains the time difference between the desired frames. barTimer contains the time of the actual frame.  In addition, the newer type  ByteBuffer inputBuffer = codec.getInputBuffer(inputBufferId); ByteBuffer outputBuffer = codec.getOutputBuffer(outputBufferId);  is used instead of the deprecated processing with buffer arrays ByteBuffer[] inputBuffers = codec.getInputBuffers(); ByteBuffer[] outputBuffers = codec.getOutputBuffers();  The time for generation is now ~3sec for a 30 minutes voice message with 99%/100% the same values for the AudioHash.  further note: seekTo() does not seem to recognize whether the entered time goes beyond the stream.

Ubuntu has been [reducing support](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2017-September/004212.html) for i386 binary packages gradually over the past few years, and as noted in #8836 it is currently not possible to construct a reproducible build container from scratch under Ubuntu 17.10 (the currently-specified [base image](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/e00f8c94ff8590aeb678ce9bdd71da2866e3ac29/Dockerfile#L1)).

After reading the code I realized that this is already implemented, but the limit being set to two seconds. Increasing the limit to 30 seconds feels right. You will get notifications after there has been more than 30 seconds without any messages being sent, so you still ""feel"" the action of the chat. However, you avoid your phone constantly notifying and vibrating.  #### Testing I have personally used the signal app with this fix for a couple of weeks, and I am a lot more satisfied with using the app.  Also the following test has been performed. 1. Send a message 2. Verify notification received 3. Send multiple messages shortly after the first one 4. Verify no notification received 5. Wait 30 seconds 6. Send a message 7.

It occurs when a conversation item selection has enough options to require an overflow menu. The overflow menu is simply broken.  I found that removing the theme from `conversation_reaction_long_press_toolbar.xml` fixed this problem and other styling issues.  If you look at the theme applied `reactions_overlay_toolbar_overflow_style` which is assigned to `@style/Signal.Toolbar.Overflow.Light` or `@style/Signal.Toolbar.Overflow`, there doesn't seem to be anything that would cause this bug to happen. The parent style is `Widget.AppCompat.ActionButton.Overflow` and I suspect the problem lies there. This theme is applied to other toolbars in the app and works properly. But in this case it doesn't work. I found that the other usages of this theme are in cases where the target `Toolbar` is sent to `setSupportActionBar`. `conversation_reaction_long_press_toolbar.xml` is not. I suspect there is some Android SDK ""magic"" happening in the background causing this composition issue.  I'm not sure what the intent of adding this theme to the toolbar was. I thought removing this theme might break dark or light mode support but in the screenshots below you can see it does not: ![Screenshot_2020-08-10-21-36-34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1737565/89848661-b514da80-db54-11ea-84e2-af158b108ee3.png) ![Screenshot_2020-08-10-21-35-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1737565/89848671-ba722500-db54-11ea-93e2-2cc5e78f4eea.png)  As far as I can tell this theme does not serve a purpose in the case of this specific toolbar. Once the theme is removed, the actions in the overflow menu have padding consistent with other overflow menus and actions can be clicked and work as expected.","closed","","jaredandrews","2020-08-11T02:06:38Z","2020-08-27T13:13:20Z"

For safety reasons, three tests were added at the beginning of the new method ""getKeyDurationFallbackForAAC(extractor)"". If the expected values are incorrect, 0 is returned as the duration.

I am aware that this pull request may not be what the team and the issue author ultimately want to implement by the following arguments:  1. The author states in the issue that the label may be redundant because the edit text below the label has the same text as the placeholder (aka hint). 2. The original, hardcoded string was `Phone Number` but this pull request will replace it with `Phone number` (lowercase `n`) for users of English locale (other locale users will now see this in their language).  The reasons I did this in this way are:  1. Removing a label seems to me a big decision that I am in no place to make. 1. But showing something in a different language from what are in other places could make the app look broken or immature to some users which I would not like them to see. 1. Adding another string to translate just for the upper/lower casing may not justify the effort by translators. And late translations would result in the same situation I worried in the above bullet point.  But please do let me know if I should have done it in a different way. I am willing to make the change to this PR. I also don't feel bad at all if this PR is closed without being merged because of a different point of view.","closed","","fumiakiy","2020-06-04T21:13:20Z","2020-06-06T03:02:33Z"

The issue was prevalent in any chat conversations when one user would receive an attachment from another user, save it, and not know the location of the saved file.   Before any changes, as stated in the reported issue ([#10149](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10149)), the pop-up text that is created when a file is saved only states ""File saved in media"", but not the actual path, causing the file to **not be able to be found afterwards**. With the changes I have made, instead of vaguely stating ""media"", I made it so that the pop-up text will provide the **specific path the downloaded file is located** (as requested in [#10149](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10149)). Below is a screenshot:    The fix was to change the result pair's string value to the actual path of the local device's external storage directory, accessible by importing the Environment library.   This was tested for spending photos and videos, and performs expectedly for both scenarios.","closed","wontfix,","umkeugene","2020-12-15T13:03:42Z","2022-02-02T01:04:48Z"

Since Signal currently seem to use the Apple Emoji font glyphs, I also decided to try it out with another font that has a permissive license. I used the noto-emoji in this PR because these are the ones I like the best.  I also guess a similar change has to be performed in Signal Desktop, and I'm also willing to work on that if that helps.

At a minimum, integrate the path for the backup location into the signal app itself so that searching for the signal support page is not necessary in order to find and move the backup file somewhere. 2. Add a button in the backup settings that takes you to the `Signal/Backup` folder in your file manager of choice so you can easily copy it to another location/etc.  (1.) is addressed through f939b4e, but (2.) is much more work-in-progress on e18005f.  From what I can tell, there doesn't appear to be a well standardized intent for simply opening a directory in another app with no intention of actually choosing a file/etc. Other solutions from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17165972/android-how-to-open-a-specific-folder-via-intent-and-show-its-content-in-a-file) and [here](http://www.openintents.org/action/android-intent-action-view/file-directory) were tried without any being a solution I'm super happy with.  As such, I'd appreciate any input on (2.) that anyone may have, but if no better solution is found, I would be perfectly fine just merging the first two commits as long as showing a file path to the user isn't considered too advanced/power user.

When unlocking, the animation with the green success checkmark is, in my opinion, too long, so I added a preference in the settings which makes it modifyable.  I also added a settingstoggle which allows the user to enable notification content even if signal is currently screenlocked.  I have tested it on both of my devices by just setting it to different values (e.g. 0 and 500) and just checking if it is ""instant""/takes 500ms. I also tested the notification content preference by texting myself from another phone while signal was locked.

While PR #9750 fixes the issue, I found that the date text in each conversation thread in the list of MainActivity is not translated in the language that was just selected.   The bug was due to the locale object cached in the list adapter which was set by `Locale.getDefault()` at the moment it was first created, and survives `activity.recreate()`.  ### Steps to verify the fix 1. Prepare an account that has one or more conversation. 1. Launch Signal. 1. Tap on your profile picture to open Settings. 1. Tap on Appearance. 1. Tap on Language. 1. Tap on Japanese (or Chinese or any other language that is not the current one). 1. Either tap on the left arrow on the action bar or tap the back button on the device to go back to Settings. 1. Again, either tap on the left arrow on the action bar or tap the back button on the device to go back to the conversation list.  Behavior at master @ [dd717b60b8936d9e237ba78b654f99c0777c4f50]:  Date text is not translated to the language that was selected.  Behavior after the PR:  Every time you choose a language, the date text in each conversation thread in the list is translated in that language.  ### Note This change effectively makes `Conversation` class the same as `ThreadRecord` class.

For a lot of people, the banner uses up valuable screen space to remind them of an option they are certain they don't want to enable. The consensus has been that it should be possible to dismiss the banner, and that the option should remain available in the group settings. This is clearer and less distracting, and maintains the important ability to decide not to share your profile with a group long-term. This PR makes that change.    The change is implemented by changing the `profile_sharing` field of the recipient database (currently a boolean) to have three states - `yes`, `no`, and `undecided`. New groups have this set to `undecided` by default, which triggers the display of the banner. The `undecided` state is treated like `no` in terms of actual profile sharing.    Tapping the banner shows the dialog as before, but the ""Cancel"" option has been changed to ""Don't share"". Interacting with the dialog causes the field to be set to either `yes` or `no`, so the banner is no longer displayed, but if it is set to `no` the option can still be changed from the group settings. A new switch is added there to enable sharing. This switch is irreversible (becoming disabled once the user chooses to share), because as I understand it the sharing action cannot be undone. If that isn't right then that can be easily changed.","closed","","freddytuxworth","2020-06-08T18:48:24Z","2020-06-10T12:22:55Z"

Fixes #10298  The media preview activity opens in the immersive full screen mode regardless of the toolbar's visibility so the toolbar starts rendering at point 0,0 and its width take all the way to the available screen. But when the system windows (navigation bar and status bar) appears when you tap on the screen, the system windows are rendered on top of the activity, thus above the toolbars. Those constructs such as the menu and the back arrow that are to be rendered at the edges of the toolbar are pushed behind the system windows, which made them unclickable.

Fixes #10159  The commit [3f2b4d60fd00fc53a714e6d1f1017e71ee7627fa] fixes the issue for audio files because it changed the url to be of `file://` so that the logic that checks if the file exists and keep changing the file name until there is no more conflict, kicks in. Unfortunately that fix works only for audio files, and more importantly it kind of downgrades what the updated code was supposed to do, which was to use content uri instead of file uri when saving a file.  This PR effectively reverts the commit [3f2b4d60fd00fc53a714e6d1f1017e71ee7627fa] and adds conflict checking of the file names to content uri too when the OS is older.  ## Steps to very the PR  1. Prepare a chat that has a voice note, a picture, a video and a pdf (and maybe another generic file) attachments. 1. Long tap each of those attachments and download it. 1. After downloading all of them, do that again for each. 1.

I understand that the revert was necessary because the commit introduced a regression that was reported in #9922 .  I was able to fix both issues at the same time by re-introducing the code added at 5f0d384 that uses the newer method to update a configuration, while the configuration created in the code also correctly carries the theme configuration by adding configChanges value `uiMode` to activities in AndroidManifest.xml.

This pull request is to fix the root cause of the #9736 by removing the uses of deprecated method (`updateConfiguration`) while keeping the behavior upon the system configuration changes to uiMode.  It turned out that at least parts of the buggy behaviors were due to bugs found in beta versions of `appcompat` library which Google claims to have fixed in the latest stable version (1.2.0). However by updating the library, some user flows fail to do what is intended in Signal. For example changing the locale and going back to the MainActivity doesn't change the language in the MainActivity after appcompat is updated to 1.2.0.   So the pull request refactors and overhauls how to handle language changes and uiMode changes in order to keep both configurations behave as intended regardless of they are set to ""System Default"" or custom Signal settings.  Those buggy behaviors were captured as screen records. Let me know if you need them so I can send you privately because it has some private information in them.  ### Steps to verify the fix #### Language changes (issue #9736) 1. Launch Signal. 1. Tap on your profile picture to open Settings. 1. Tap on Appearance. 1. Tap on Language. 1. Tap on Japanese (or Chinese or any other language that is not the current one). 1. Either tap on the left arrow on the action bar or tap the back button on the device to go back to Settings. 1. Again, either tap on the left arrow on the action bar or tap the back button on the device to go back to the conversation list. 1. Tap on the magnifier icon on the action bar. 1. If you see the hint in the edit text translated in the language you choose at the step above, repeat from the step 3 one more time.   * I saw sometimes the bug reproduces at the first iteration, but most of the times I see this bug reproduces after the second iteration.  Actual behavior of the master @[dd717b60b8936d9e237ba78b654f99c0777c4f50]:  In most cases, after the second iteration, the hint text in the edit text field is not translated in the current language that you choose.  Expected behavior after this PR:  Every time you choose a language, the hint text in the edit text field is translated in that language.  #### Dark Mode config (issue #9922) 1. Set the Signal's theme to System Default 1. Launch Android Settings 1. Change the dark mode setting to the other one (if it is not dark, set it to dark. If it is dark, set it to not dark). 1. Open Recent Apps list and go back to Signal  Expected behavior after this PR:  Every time you change the setting, Signal follows the setting accordingly.  #### Scheduled or quick Dark Mode config (issue #10017) 1. Follow [this instruction](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10017#issuecomment-692954690) to add the quick Dark Mode button in the quick settings bar. 1. Launch Signal 1. Set the Signal's theme to System Default 1. In any Activity, use the quick config button to change the theme to Dark and Not Dark 1. If you have Android R (API 30), schedule Dark Mode to on/off  Expected behavior after this PR:  Every time the system changes the setting, Signal follows the setting accordingly.","closed","","fumiakiy","2020-09-26T22:58:58Z","2020-11-12T20:14:23Z"

The border radiuses are set for each corner i.e. topLeft, topRight, bottomRight and bottomLeft. In RTL languages, topLeft is the ""end"" of the item while topRight is the ""start"" of the item as opposed to in LTR languages, yet the code didn't take it into account. This PR adds a few lines to take RTL/LTR into account to determine which value to set to which corner.  **Note to dev** Please note that this fix was also in [the other RTL related PR](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/11012) because it was also required there. I cherry picked the commit in order for this PR to be self contained. It should not conflict in merging but let me know if it does.

Whats actually happening is that Signal looks through the users existing contacts, and any which are Signal users it creates a new raw contact in the account Signal. These are all given the fixed phone number type of ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.TYPE_OTHER.  When Android does Contact Aggregation it uses the phone type ""other"" from the Signal raw contact rather than the phone type from the original raw contact. (Note for some types such as ""mobile"" the aggregation seems to keep the existing type).  But to the average user who probably does not understand raw contacts and contact aggregation linked view this looks like Signal is over writing contact information. It would be better if when Signal creates its copy of the contacts if it copied the phone type rather than using ""other"" all the time.","closed","","nightflame2","2020-02-28T08:36:14Z","2022-05-29T07:49:29Z"
