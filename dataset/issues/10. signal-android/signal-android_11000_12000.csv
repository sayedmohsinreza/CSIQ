"","818","Ancient unsent messages sent after update","Yesterday morning my phone auto-updated TextSecure. I noticed the icon had just changed to the circular one, so clicked it, and authenticated. I followed the one-time process of registering on the server, and all seemed normal.  Later, i found out that a message I'd sent on the 18th december (to two recipients) had just been received by them. I presume it had failed to send back in december due to bad signal or some such, and the software update had just tried it again (I know where I was when I sent the message has little or no signal a lot of the time).  Seeing as the message was ""I'm in the pub"" and was sent at 8.15am, it lead to a few probing questions about my drinking habits ;-)  Anyway, I doubt this is the sort of thing we can track down and ""fix"", but I thought I'd mention it and see if anyone else was affected.  TextSecure is showing version 2.0.2 right now, although I think it updated again during the night, so I'm not sure exactly which version sent the ancient unsent messages.","closed","","coofercat","2014-02-27T10:00:37Z","2015-03-16T20:02:52Z"

"","967","Misleading SMS fallback disabled reason","With the new PUSH Protocol, I believe the string: preferences__allow_sms_fallback_disabled_reason in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/master/res/values/strings.xml might be misleading.  If you are not registered for push, it says TS is configured as default SMS app and this is the reason you can't disable SMS fallback. However I think the reason is because I'm not registered for push. So there could be two reasons why one can't disable SMS fallback: not registered for push or default SMS app.  Maybe the string should be updated.","closed","","JavaJens","2014-03-03T17:13:54Z","2014-03-04T14:58:38Z"

"","1277","Group MMS ordering while DB is locked","While at the gym I silenced my phone and left it (the DB is password locked, and set to lock after 1 hour of inactivity), when I got back there were 40 new messages.  39 of them were from a Group MMS Session (I'm the only one in the group with Text Secure this is a standard MMS Group Message).  The notification listed several messages from people in that group I assumed it was from the group message (although technically the notification was from the individual people) I only saw 3-4 new messages in the group.  I later noticed all the other messages came through the message thread for the individual users that sent the specific message.  They were listed as ""MMS Message click to download"", I had to go through the threads for 4 people and click ""download message"" for each one, and then as they downloaded they were moved into the MMS group message thread.  The bigger issue, is they were moved into the MMS group thread using the date stamp of the time I hit ""download message"", so the MMS Group thread shows them in the order I downloaded them, not in the order they were sent causing the conversation to be jumbled  (I don't know anything about the MMS spec, perhaps time stamps aren't part of it, and are created when received?).  This was on a Nexus 4, Over the Air Official Google ROM, non-rooted. on T-mobile, Wi-Fi was not on.  If it makes any difference 2 of the people in the group were on iPhones, one was on another Android phone, and I'm not sure what the fourth person was on.  I'm assuming the few new messages in the group thread showed up before the DB was locked, and the rest came through after, but I don't know for sure.  That's all I can think of at the moment that might be relevant.  Let me know if there is any other information I might be able to provide.","closed","mms,","Vadoola","2014-04-01T14:36:12Z","2015-05-30T00:05:51Z"

That means the user has no control over when SMS are sent to non-TS contacts. It just happens (and the user incurs the costs).  I suggest to replace this checkbox:  ``` Allow SMS fallback [X] ```  With a popup menu:  ``` SMS fallback       [Allow | Allow but warn | Off] ```  `Allow` means SMS are always sent if the receiver doesn't have TS or the phone is not on a Wifi/bluetooth network.  `Allow but warn` means that the `send` icon (the paper plane) will be overlaid with a little SMS speech bubble with an exclamation mark inside (I'm happy to do this icon). Also, whenever a new thread is started where fallback SMS must be used and the user presses the `send` icon, a warning pop-up will be displayed (which could have a `Never show this again` checkbox). This could also be displayed when the receiver goes offline during a conversation (see #678).  `Off` means the `send` icon will be grayed out when the phone is not on a Wifi/bluetooth network. (Receivers w/o TS should be filtered out from the contacts list in this case, see #664). It still means TextSecure will _receive_ all SMS if it is the default messaging app on the phone. Emergency numbers should always be excluded from this, ofc.","closed","feature,","virtualritz","2014-02-25T11:00:38Z","2014-04-16T20:16:41Z"

The title states the name of the person that was shown in the notification, not of the group chat, and all the UI is the same as in a 1-on-1 chat. There are also no names displayed on top of the messages.  The weird broken thing is that it will not _actually_ be the chat with that person, but it will show messages from the group chat. I can even send messages there, it just gets very confusing because the messages _appear_ to be sent only to that single person.  It's a mere display error that can be fixed by exiting the chat with the person (tapping on left arrow in upper left corner of the screen) and then selecting the group chat again. It will then show as a group chat. No logs end up in the wrong place or anything, and the names of the people that sent you messages are correctly shown.

If this happens by accident, e.g. because the network connection is temporarily down or because I thought that the recipient also uses TectSecure but he doesn't, then it can become really expensive.  It would be great if SecureText could provide a warning before sending a message as SMS. Something like ""Message will be send as SMS? [continue] [postpone] [cancel]"". ""continue"" will send the message as SMS, ""cancel"" will cancel the action and ""postpone"" will keep the message back until the network connection becomes available again and then send it (ideally) automatically.

Two recipients who use iPhones (if that matters) responses are appended to my 1-1 threads with them, respectively (both have group messaging via MMS enabled on their phones). The message details for these responses confirm that they were sent over MMS.  Responses from the other recipient, who is using the Android Messaging app, are appended to a _different_ group thread with the same recipients (and if I delete that, it creates a new thread). But her responses are the only ones that ever end up in that thread, because everyone else's goes to their own 1-1 threads with me. She also has group messaging via MMS enabled.  Other MMS (picture messages) work fine (I haven't customized the MMS proxy settings at all).

In a perfect world, every contact would also be a push contact, i.e. loading the push contacts would take just as much time as loading the ""normal"" contacts. I rebuilt this so that everything is being loaded in a background thread. See commit message for implementation details.  In the second commit, I added an option that should fix #664, hiding of non-push users. I only did this in one list yet (the one where you select someone to open a conversation with).

In pt-PT, ""deletar"" is not a thing,   and there's a separate pt-BR translation, so I decided to go with ""apagar"". - ""plaintext"" was translated both as ""texto simples"" and ""não cifrado/a"". The former   is a literal translation, and the latter conveys the fact that the text is not encrypted.   Decided to go with ""não cifrado"" (""not encrypted"").  Subjective change: - ""intercâmbio de chaves"" changed to ""troca de chaves"" (key exchange).

This takes time and if I scroll a conversation really fast, it ""hangs"" for short periods of time. This is not only because of the bitmaps, but also because of them. This cache should inprove that and reduce CPU overhead.  Also I prepared this for #1027 making it into mainline.

I remember when setting up the app on their phones I did not set a password to protect the local message base, but I did so when setting up the app on my phone. Probably more important difference is that I am on a Dual-SIM Huawei (with second SIM currently switched off though) while their Samsung phones are all single-SIM.  So far, I have tested only on wlan (yes, when setting up TextSecure on all phones, I ""registered"" the phone no of the active SIM card, so all phones should be able to use wlan, not just SMS).  Any idea what I could do so they get my messages? Thank you! -mgkai","closed","","mgkai","2014-03-16T23:29:52Z","2015-03-16T19:18:26Z"

Furthermore, more complicated approaches like  #328 come to mind; but especially sending dummy messages and dummy content would severly short battery life and increase network usage.","closed","","phime42","2014-02-28T15:32:14Z","2014-03-01T23:30:12Z"

For example, on a regular basis a use a corporate network and a university network. They are both heavily monitored and packets and protocols through them are managed and stay behind one or several proxies. This means that sometimes Push messages can't get through and I need to either go and switch off my network, which I use for other things, or switch off Push, which means I have to reregister again afterwards. I am sure there are other situations where you want to be able to just suspend Push functionality, not 'cripple' it completely.   So my idea is that switching off Push and unregistering from server should be put on different buttons and be kept relatively independent of each other.","closed","feature,","kgizdov","2014-03-06T17:02:15Z","2014-03-17T08:56:32Z"

The left phone is the phone of the white user (thats me), the right one ins the green users phone. On picture 1, green user (right phone) recieves a blank message from me (white user, left phone), which I have never sent. Then, green user recives a message from blue user at 13:42, whicht never arrived at my phone (white user, left phone). Then green user sends with the right phone a message an 13:42, which is also not delivered to me (white user, left phone). Now green user (right phone) recieves an empty message from blue user, which I (white user, left phone) have also never received.  On picture two, you can see that the green user (right phone) received my messages from picture 1 (Test, Test 2) much later. She answered at 14:19 and this message arrived at my phone, but her message from 14:34 then again has never came through to me (left phone, white user).  While I can understand that messages in group chats can get mixed up, depending on the network availability of the receiver or depending on current server load, and so on, dropped messages are very bad. I don't really know how to reproduce this. It is hard to read the log files, because there are no timestamps. Also, I'd like to add that both phones users only used the mobile carriers network during this conversation, which is very stable here in the city, so network problems are unlikely.","closed","","sagischwarz","2014-02-27T18:19:59Z","2014-02-28T01:18:18Z"

I propose that the ""unlocked"" status icon be changed to something unique that identifies the unlocked status, specifically to TextSecure.

But the green color has confused myself, @sagischwarz, @phenx-de and literally everybody I have told to install the app.   @phenx-de and myself have had a rather extensive discussion about the whole shebang in #908.  What we came up with: - Use orange instead of green   - Green is widely used to indicate security aka encryption (green traffic light -> you're safe / good to go) and people are used very to it.   - Green is already used to indicate encryption / TS users in the contact list    - It also collides with several ideas in #741 and #910 to indicate trust   - Orange is the only color left in the Android color scheme, apart from purple: https://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html   - It doesn't have such a direct association as green and red have - Use toned down colors to indicate the most likely transport for messages that aren't sent yet (#796)   - Provides information about the most likely transport   - Indicates that the message hasn't been send yet - We should use color strips on a light grey message body. Either on the speakers' side or on top of the messages   - A whole window of completely colored messages looks very playful/cartoonish   - It improves the contrast of the gray message-delivered text and icons below the message, making it easier to read   - Scale down the importance of the transport information to a reasonable level  - Color both the messages of sender and receiver   - While roaming and in some countries people have to pay (a lot) for incoming texts, so knowing if it's an SMS or not is important.   - The current implementation is inconsistent from a UX perspective.  This is what @phenx-de came up with:  **Blue message sides for data and orange message sides for SMS:** ![phenx_blue](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2306175/f6c9bfa2-a27d-11e3-9ac5-b862f93f24da.png)____![phenx_orange](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6797943/2306177/fe8b3982-a27d-11e3-80ff-e2623f780581.png)  Those are two of my own mockup sets, one with white and one with grey backgrounds.

"","328","Feature request: Sending dummy short messages","TextSecure could mask meaningful communication between people by occasionally sending dummy random messages to random recipients at random times: - Recipients would be chosen randomly between contacts that knowingly use TextSecure, so it could be recognized as such after decryption and automatically discarded by recipient. - ""Randomness"" should be tweaked to level-out the legitimate messages, spoiling the traffic analysis of traffic retention data, preventing to weigh connections in the deducted social network graph or guessing sleeping/activity patterns.  People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures  Possible extensions:  - Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). - Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. - Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a [TTL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) of each such number.","closed","feature,","stefanb","2013-08-29T07:51:17Z","2018-04-02T21:18:24Z"

Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..)

BTW, silent SMS'es could be detected with Osmocom paltform. There is an application for Osmocom called Catcher catcher, which also detects silent SMS's, more info here: https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/catcher/wiki  However, Osmocom is highly ""hacking"" platform, it is not usable for everyday use.

"","702","App will send SMS over data when recipient no longer has TextSecure installed, no way to revert back to unencrypted messaging","Serious bug that can render conversation with a specific contact almost un-usable.   Particular case:  My friend had TextSecure, but uninstalled it when he re-flashed his ROM. In the previous version of TextSecure I simply pressed padlock>abort secure session.  However, since the update my phone tries to send him encrypted texts over data. None of these he receives because he does not have the app installed anymore.   I can long-press send to enable the option to ""send unencrypted"" however, when sending sms over data is enabled, it will still send encrypted even though I instructed it not to do so. This is another bug.   The only way to send him texts anymore is to disable sms over data in settings, and then long-press send to send unencrypted, only then will the app actually send an unencrypted text message.  I have to do this every time I want to reply to him. It's greatly annoying.   So in a nutshell, the three problems are:  1) App does not check that user actually still uses TextSecure, and forces a secure connection even when one cannot be made.   2) There is no easy way to force the app to send unencrypted texts to a user when data mode is enabled. When data mode is disabled, the method is still unclear and requires ""send unencrypted"" to be chosen each time you want to send a message. The removal of ""abort secure session"" has made this problem very bad, I cannot delete old keys from my key inventory.   3) Long-press the send button when data is enabled to access ""send unencrypted"" does not work. Will always revert to sending an encrypted message.   These three problems make the app almost unusable with certain contacts who have uninstalled TextSecure.","closed","","Armestam","2014-02-25T17:03:05Z","2014-02-27T16:11:33Z"

So I'm pretty sure that the problem is related to the Android version (everybody is using TS 2.0.3).

In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order. - Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)? - Idea 2: Give each message a sequence number generated by the TextSecure server.

Green speech bubble appears from the right with a key icon which says ""Error sending message"" 5.) Register phone number over cell data plan/SMS, failed 6.) Go home, turn on wifi, connect to AP, register phone number successfully 7.) Now secure testing works as expected  There are two reasons I don't like this: A.) I'd prefer to not be on a list of phone numbers that use TextSecure.  I don't understand why such a list exists. B.) Since the new protocol doesn't appear to require SMS nor MMS, I would like to be able to use TextSecure via WiFi on a phone with no provider.  If registration was not required, or if it were possible to register without providing a phone number and requiring that an SMS be sent/received, it seems like this would work fine.

TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message.

The system SMS app handles this quite well by displaying a big warning dialog that TitaniumBackup is now the default messaging app, but TS kept quiet so I almost missed some important messages, I only received them because of my Pebble smartwatch.  Now I know that TS will still work without SMS, so it should not display such an extreme warning message, but I think it would be nice to display it at least once, like ""You just changed your default SMS app to be TitaniumBackup instead of TextSecure.

I was using another app (not Text Secure) when the phone went dark then after several seconds the phone booted but many of my user preferences were lost (desktop was reset to the factory default, etc.) However my apps were all still installed and I was able to start Text Secure, enter my passphrase, and access the message threads, however the following happened: 1. message thread contact profile photos were replaced with the generic gray ""human silhouette"" image 2. threads contact names are now either ""anonymous"" or ""unknown"" (my encrypted threads are anonymous, the other unencrypted threads are either anonymous or unknown) 3. within an existing thread I can send a message to the correct recipient, but the message is not encrypted (the lock icon at the top is shown closed though as if the encrypted session is ongoing).  What still works: - passphrase - I can view the messages in both encrypted and unencrypted threads. - when opening threads (encrypted or not) the profile photo of the sender is shown next to each message - clicking the profile photo next to any message (encrypted or not) I get the contact information for the sender. - I can end the previous encrypted session (see bullet 3 above however) and initiate a new encrypted session through the normal key exchange.  So it appears the the information for each message was maintained, however the information for the thread (including the key for encrypted sessions) was lost.  I'm not certain there is really a Text Secure bug here since I don't believe it caused the system crash but maybe the data regarding message threads could be maintained in an improved way so that it isn't lost to a crash like this.","closed","","rlmcneary2","2013-11-23T16:13:12Z","2013-12-03T06:34:05Z"

(sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface.  Reasons I need this 1. new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. 2. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. 3. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will.  For public keys. 1. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. 2. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go.

Not everybody (as a sender or receiver) has MMS setup or knows how MMS should be setup, so TextSecure makes it now very hard to use it as the default app for all kind of messages, if group messaging is not possible without any fiddling in the settings. -> Without being able to send Groupmessages as SMS TextSecure is less likely being adopted, as it is not a straight drop-in replacement for the default messenger.

Unless a forensic analysis of the users phone is done, it should be sufficient to imitate another app. We could automatically clone the icon and name of the other app. When somebody the clicks on the TS icon (which looks like the other apps icon), we can just show a screenshot of the loading screen / main screen of the other app for a few seconds.  If the user presses a certain set if buttons in a combination he set up himself within this timeframe, we open TS. Otherwise we just open the other app.  I am not sure if it's possible (technically and legally) to hide the original apps icon in the app drawer, or to automate the screenshot part, but working out the details is what this issue is for.  Because the popularity of apps is highly dependent on country and culture, the user has to be able to choose the app he wants TS to impersonate.   We should also consider adding this step to the setup screen for the highest security level discussed in #838.

This is taking up a lot of space, which I think is unnecessary. Therefore, I propose not to display the timestamp if it is the same as the previous messages or differs only by a certain amount of time (say, less than a minute).  As the padlock should still be displayed, let me suggest aligning own messages to the left in multi-line message bubbles (Google Hangouts does it that way, too, and I find it a lot easier to read) and to place the padlock symbol at the right end of the last line. For single-line messages, either a margin and then the padlock in the same line would be imaginable.  I believe that these changes would increase readability and orientation, as temporal pauses in conversation are easier to spot and more messages fit the screen without it looking cramped.

"","838","Choice of security presets during setup","If we want TextSecure to compete with W**_sapp, F_book and other less privacy/security focused apps and plattforms, it has to be as user friendly as them. And it should be. Otherwise it'll never get a significant market share with the average users. But we also want to provide maximum security for people who depend on it with their lives, maybe because they live in an undemocratic country and have an unpopular opinion, maybe because they are protesting the regime in Syria, maybe they are gay and happen to live in Uganda or any of the other 82 coutries where that can get you in jail or even executed.  As TextSecure is supposed to be secure **and** user friendly there are going to be more and more cases where we will have to decide on a default behaviour, often between the safer and the more convenient option. Many of the convenient features, which many users want, because they know and love them from W**_sapp, F_book and other less privacy/security focused apps and plattforms leak data, which, in some really bad cases, could lead to people getting hurt or worse.  An example would be a notification popup with the message content like #798 requests. In some cases even mentioning the sender alone can be a threat (#308 and #366). It gets really bad if this can even happen on a locked phone (#198).  If we neither want to force the average user to go deep into the advanced settings to manually activate all the features they expect (really bad usability) nor want to endanger some users by choosing insecure but convenient defaults, we should ask the user at the setup level what their use case is: - casual user - moderately security concious user - tinfoilhat™ / protester in $nodemocracyhere   Based on their choice we'll set default settings for the above mentioned features, as well as security features like #175, #226 and #328 and future convenience features.  It should also be possible to re-run this from the advanced settings.  One of the most important presets for the paranoid mode would be to turn off SMS messages entirely, because the metadata, which is the most important tool in modern surveillance, can't be hidden. The network providers can also easily scan the traffic and find out who uses TS, which will put people at risk.  With data that problem doesn't exist, because the relay (GCM) probably isn't controlled by the ""enemy"" and it works like an anonymizing proxy, because lots of normal apps use GCM. As long as HTTPS (TLS) isn't broken (again...), data should be safe.","closed","feature,","generalmanager","2014-02-27T17:35:36Z","2018-04-02T21:25:04Z"

If someone writes something into the group, I see a message in an ""unknown group"", but cannot reply since my TS does not know the recipients.  I think there should be some way to send the group data from one TS that still knows this information to the one that lost it. This is what I think could be done (let my buddy be called 'Bob'): 1. I restore a backup, my group is gone. 2. Bob sends something in that group. 3. My TS sees that it's missing a group, and that Bob is most probably part of it. It sends a ""please give me the group data"" message to Bob. 4. Bob's TS receives the message and checks that I am actually part of that group (so we don't leak group data to potential outsiders). It then sends a message with the whole group information to me.  Also, there should be a way to do this manually from Bob's client.  @moxie0 Since you're thinking about adding message types anyway (talking about delivery receipts), could this be done?","closed","feature,","tinloaf","2014-03-27T14:58:07Z","2016-12-01T20:54:10Z"

We could of course simplify this by only exchanging the identity keys and doing all the DH fun over the network. And we already have the whole identity scan option setup.  This way we can exchange TS contacts without having to type phone numbers (like animals :D) But more importantly we also verified the identity in the same step.  At this point there is one problem tough: We don't have a way to insert the contact into the Android contacts yet. As far as I can see there two ways we can take: - We can use this as a way to exchange TS IDs without telling someone our phone number. To do so we would have to add TextSecure accounts to Android. Afterwards we can add contacts with those accounts, which just have the identity key. But this needs another permission - from what I heard from moxie, we should wait some time before introducing new ones. - We can ask the server to hand us the phone number (or email / the other fun stuff from #1085 if that ever gets implemented), which we then add as a normal contact. This would probably  call for some slight modifications to the server tough.  What's your comments, ideas, criticism?

This does the bare minimum to get text secure working properly in KitKat. It does not implement any quick response functionality, to keep it simple.   I corrected a lot of messy whitespace in the manifest; I can revert if you don't want that.  I've tested and it works as expected in both KitKat older android. As a nice to have, it would be cool  for the app to display a banner when it is notnot the default SMS app, similar to stock SMS app.","closed","","byxorna","2013-11-13T23:38:04Z","2014-06-14T08:14:43Z"
"","1110","Crash when sending SMS on Motorola Moto G","I saw the following problem on two **different** Motorola Moto G devices: - Sending messages to another TS user via push works well. - TS crashes every time you try to send a normal, unencrypted SMS to a recipient without TS.

But I wonder why that is, because on my phone (GNexus) TS works just fine with a **disabled** SMS app.  Here's the logcat:  ``` --------- beginning of /dev/log/main  W/ConversationActivity(24571): Sending message...

Baring in mind Tasker has no access to TextSecures database so can not be responsible for checking for new messages. Realistically TextSecure would have to notify Tasker of a new message.  Could TextSecure be used to send a Broadcast Intent when a new message is received? Then Tasker would only have to listen for them. You could also setup extra variables for senders name or message, configurable from with-in TextSecure so the user could decided how much or how little information is then available to the system.  My specific use case at present is Tasker speaks the sender name of a message to me and while I'm driving it reads out the message aloud so having the extra variables set would be helpful.

"","1085","Allow different kinds of identifiers for registration","I know it's come up in the mailing list and on twitter and I'd also really like to see the possibility to register with different kinds of proof of identity.  It's obvious that this would be a rather large feature and all the little quirks and bugs have to ironed out before any of the devs will have time to think about implementing something like this. But I'd like to use this issue for brainstorming and discussing ideas which possibilities of proof of identity exist, that are safer and / or more anonymous than phone numbers or email addresses.  TextSecure uses a security model called trust on first use or TOFU. This means the TextSecure server checks if you control some unique identifier by which your contact's know you.   This is currently done with your phone number, which is great if your friends want to find you. But it's not ideal at all if you don't want to be found. And also for security reasons.  **If** this initial check was not compromised, you can be very sure that your communication can not be intercepted or faked by any known kind of attack on the transport. If TLS breaks (again) then an attacker with control to the data transport can tell that you are using TextSecure and probably also with which number you registered and who you talk to. But they won't be able to read your texts, unless they compromise your phone directly. But this isn't something TextSecure or any app can do much about. It's also a lot harder, more expensive, complex and dangerous (easier to detect) to do this on a wide scale than it is to compromise the transport.  Phone numbers are really bad for many reasons: 1. They are directly linked to your real life identity by several public and non-public databases. There are no throw-away phones in Europe and many other parts of the world like there are in the US. EU law requires the stores to register and verify your identity with your national ID card. 2. You can only carry around / check so many phones/sim cards. You also have to get one phone for each sim card, because the phones IMEI is automatically logged together with the sim card identifier. That means if you just change sim cards, it's rather obvious to the network provider / the guy that owned the network provider / your average dictator that you are still using the same phone. So you are probably the same person/entity. 3. Once you somehow got a relatively anonymous phone number, it's not easy to just switch to a different one, because you probably use this for a number of different places / contacts, because it was expensive/arduous to get and you can't have 50 phones lying around all the time (see 2.).  4 It's really easy for the network providers or anybody with a little incentive to trace you to a rather small physical area. If you want to know more about the phone tracing (for 15$), watch some of Karsten Nohl's talks from the differenc Chaos Communication Congresses. 1. It's also rather easy to fake the identity of a mobile phone. Not just for the network operators but also for the average IT guy. Watch the same stuff I recommended in 4. if you want to know more.  In the future it will be possible to register with an email address, but that's not that great either. Let's see which of the above problems disappear by using an email. 1. It's really easy to get an anonymous email address. TOR + some random email account, that's not linked to anything else you do, should be good enough for most people. 2. No problem, you can have as many email accounts as you like. But you should start a new TOR session for checking each and should probably not check them one after another to prevent correllation attacks (the same e-mails always get checked together, it's probably the same guy). 3. No problem, it's easy as pie to get a new one (see 1.) 4. With TOR and/or other methods of anonymization it shouldn't be a problem if you are disciplined enough to always stick to some basic rules. 5. Okay that's a biggie. It's actually easier for a powerful attacker to fake owning somebodies email address, or to get control over the adress itself by other means than it is for mobile phones.  So especially problem Number 5 still has to be solved.  Because this means that it's possible to do a man in the middle attack (MITM) on somebody who is using TextSecure.  Currently there aren't many ways to get a unique but anonymous identifier that is also extremely hard to impersonate.  One possible solution would be to use some kind of crypto currency.  Some possibilities I found: **Software:** - [Pond](https://pond.imperialviolet.org/) identities with [PANDA](https://github.com/agl/panda) for easy authentication. [interesting talk about pond+panda](http://koeln.ftp.media.ccc.de/congress/2013/workshops/30c3-WS-en-YBTI_Apps-Jacob_Appelbaum-Pond.webm) - [GNUnet egos](https://gnunet.org/identity-subsystem) Appears to be a [great solution](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5212_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201312272145_-_the_gnu_name_system_-_grothoff.html) but an alpha web client is at least going to take until the end of the year. - [Bitcoin SIN](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Identity_protocol_v1) - NameID (Namecoin identity + OpenID) - OneName  - Keyhotee - [Decentralized Anonymous Credentials](http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/622.pdf) - NXT (coin) alias - Ripple identity - Ethereum identities - Maidsafe identities - Twister identities - PGP keys  **Hardware:** - Yubikeys - CryptoStick - TREZOR - Other Smartcards  It would be great if we found something that can be run on the clients themselves, otherwise we would still have to trust the TS server, that he has verified the identity (as it is now). But then all our effort would have been rather futile, because if the server gets compromised, the same attack as described above can happen.  However, the block chains of the crypto currencies that have a kind of id or alias system enabled are already too big to fit on most cell phones. If we just run a ""light client"", that asks a website if the person is indeed who he pretends to be, we have to trust this server that it hasn't been compromised. Sounds like a lot of work for nothing. We could ask several different servers, to lower the chances of an attack, but we can never be really sure.  Then there are things like Yubikeys or the Crypto-Stick. But they are so little used that there is currently no easy way to get them anonymously from a local shop.  I'm open for any suggestion.  Currently it seems to me like using anonymous email + verifying the keys after the exchange is probably the least effort.  This is also kinda connected to #838.","closed","feature,","generalmanager","2014-03-07T21:08:45Z","2018-04-02T21:23:43Z"

I'm not sure what this should accomplish, so I don't know if the behaviour is a bug or if I want a new feature.  _This is what I want:_ **Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection** - the mesage gets sent via sms - the message is encrypted  **Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off** - the message gets sent via SMS - the message is encrypted  **Case 3: I am in an encrypted SMS chat** - the message gets sent via SMS - the message is encrypted  **Case 4: I am in an unencrypted SMS chat** - the message gets sent via SMS - message is not encrypted  _This is what I would expect from ""send unencrypted message"":_ **Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection** - the mesage gets sent via data - message is not encrypted  **Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off** - the message gets sent via SMS - message is not encrypted  **Case 3: I am in an encrypted SMS chat** - the message gets sent via SMS - message is not encrypted  **Case 4: I am in an unencrypted SMS chat** - the message gets sent via SMS - message is not encrypted  _That's how it ""works"", at least for me:_ **Case 1: I am in a data chat and have an internet connection** - the message gets sent via **data** (I don't know it this should be happening) - message is **encrypted** (this should probably not happen)  **Case 2: I am in a data chat and turn wifi and mobile internet off** - the message gets sent via SMS - the message is not encrypted  **I haven't tested case 3 and 4 yet (tell me if you want me to).**  **Is there any use in having this function?** If so, could you quickly explain what it's supposed to do and why? It doesn't really help if two people write via SMS and somehow the session gets messed up - you could just go ahead and end or renew the session via the lock in the top bar.  I would personally like to be able to manually force the use of SMS and several friends asked me if it's implemented already. For most of them the usecase for that looks like this: The receiver turns off wifi and mobile internet to not be disturbed by instant messages or mails while doing important work. The expectation is, If somebody really needs to contact you, they'll either call or write a text message. Many people I know use exactly this behaviour at work and others know that. So when it's working hours, the other one doesn't immediately reply to your push messages, and you have to contact them, forcing TS to send an SMS is the next best option. No need for TS to know if they are offline (#677, #678)","closed","","generalmanager","2014-03-01T21:41:30Z","2014-06-21T14:19:50Z"

This is happening for a couple of contacts which I already had in my address book as ""zone-number"" and later edited to ""+country-zone-number"" so the universal ID would work. I already had TextSecure working before the push update as SMS app.  Wanted to give the Push feature a try, so:  I had a contact with the following number: Juan de los Palotes  (011)-5555-4444  I edited said number to: Juan de los Palotes  +54-11-5555-4444  But, even though I see the new number in my android contacts listing (editing the subject), and in the TextSecure interface if I press the ""plus"" to write a new message I see the name and the new number below it (in the listing of all the contacts), when I click the user, it takes me to my message thread with said user, where the name above has the _old_ number below it.  If I disable SMS/MMS and fallback mode, the message fails with ""Error sending message"". The background is green, and in message details it shows the transport is SMS.  If I enable SMS or fallback mode, it's sent vía SMS.  So, SMS is working every time (old number or new number), but I can't get the app to recognize the number with the new format in push mode, even though I went to ""Settings"" -> ""Refresh Push Directory"" after editing the contact. Even restarted the phone just in case I needed to log-out/in.  Also worth noting: My friend can send me push notifications in the same chat thread. He sees his chats as blue, while mine are always green. If I long press and see the message details for his messages, I see they are ""Push"".

"","1135","number verification requirement seems back-asswards","Hi, I meant not to be crude with the title, just direct.  As it is now, if you want to use the data/IM channel you have to associate TextSecure with your mobile number. I realize that ""data channel"" refers to mobile data plan, which of course should require a phone number, but if userperson wishes to use TextSecure over wifi purely as an IM, it is bizarre to ask for phone number verification. So, at this point I'd like to suggest a ""wifi only"" option at hangin' out with the setup wizard time, wherein no number is asked for. Shouldn't IM over wifi, which has no technical need for a number, be the option that does not request it for setup? Obviously mobile communication must; but wifi has no justifiable reason to.  I hope that requesting a number isn't considered an ""anti-abuse"" measure, as if users who have accounts with telcos are sweet little darlings who'd nary hurt a fly, but wifi users are criminals from the wrong side of the tracks; Telegram seems to do this too, it sucks.  If it's just about spam accounts, there are many ways to demand ""proof of work"" from a user. To use someone's account with a telco to verify that they are an actual individual sort of flies in the face of the modern countersurveillance movement.

"","301","Endless sending of OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage possible?","Hi,   I have recently tried to establish a secure session with a friend, but we both had the problem that TextSecure didn't stop sending new key exchange requests which were verified by the TextSecure instance on the other side correctly. And paying for messages that are sent automaticly every 2 minutes is not funny... ;)  I might have found the problem in the code, but I'm not sure, so please take a look at the following classes and code fragments:  KeyExchangeProcessor: the method 'public boolean processKeyExchangeMessage(KeyExchangeMessage message, long threadId)' is initially called by the SmsReceiver, if the received key exchange message is from a valid sender (else if (processor.isTrusted(keyExchangeMessage)))  this method will send a new OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage, if 'needsResponseFromUs()' evaluates to true.  private boolean needsResponseFromUs() {     return !hasInitiatedSession() || remoteKeyRecord.getCurrentRemoteKey() != null; }  The remoteKey is set afterwards:  remoteKeyRecord.setCurrentRemoteKey(message.getPublicKey());  After that the IdentityKey of the message is set in the database for this recipient:  ``` if (message.hasIdentityKey()) {   DatabaseFactory.getIdentityDatabase(context)                  .saveIdentity(masterSecret, recipient, message.getIdentityKey()); } ```  and the initially received KeyExchangeMessage is scheduled for decrypt:     DecryptingQueue.scheduleRogueMessages(context, masterSecret, recipient);  Please take a look to the DecryptingQueue.java file: The scheduled decrypt for the KeyExchangeMessage should finally land in the method 'handleKeyExchangeProcessing(String plaintxtBody)'  Here the method processKeyExchangeMessage is called again, if the message has a valid IdentityKey:  else if (processor.isTrusted(keyExchangeMessage)) {             DatabaseFactory.getEncryptingSmsDatabase(context).markAsProcessedKeyExchange(messageId);             processor.processKeyExchangeMessage(keyExchangeMessage, threadId); }  Since the remoteKey is set, another OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage will be sent and the message will be scheduled again...  So we have a constellation where the OutgoingKeyExchangeMessage is sent endlessly. But I'm not sure, if it's possible to get into this loop, but my experience suggests it is...  The AUTO_KEY_EXCHANGE_PREF must be set to true in the preferences.  I hope this description is helpful.  Best regards Axel","closed","","ghost","2013-08-08T21:48:53Z","2014-04-07T06:03:56Z"

It no longer shows any non-TextSecure contacts, even if I enter their names on top. Only TextSecure users are shown. 2. When I search for contacts, the displad number will be completely dependant on the name and not actually search for the contact. For instance, when I enter a, b or c, this will produce a ""2""; when I enter d, e or f it will produce a ""3"", and so on. 3. Clicking on any of the showing contacts produces a window with the heading ""2131492904 "". It is always that some number and I don't know what it means. 4. Below that new window, which usually showed all the number available for that contact, there is just empty white space. So I cannot even start new conversations with TextSecure users.

"","1207","'Tap for SMS fallback' apparently has a malfunction","Hi Everybody! Apparently, the recently implemented 'Tap for SMS fallback' function is not working correctly. Try yourselves:  Consider that everybody is a TextSecure user with 'Push messages' setted and all of them have an encrypted session established with Alice (me). I (Alice) am with all the following options setted:  [v] Push messages [v] Receive all SMS [v] SMS delivery reports [v] Complete key exchanges Allow ougoing SMS to:     [v] TextSecure users     [v] Ask before sending SMS     [v] Non-TextSecure users  Step 1. Alice (online) send the message 01 to Bob, which seems to have been delivered (blue balloon, locked).  Step 2. Alice (offline) send the message 02 to Bob, which is not sent; instead, appears the 'Tap for SMS fallback' tab, and Alice clicks 'Yes' in the box 'Fallback to SMS?', so the message is sent via SMS (green balloon, locked), as expected.  Step 3. Alice (online) send the message 03 to Bob, which seems to have been delivered (blue balloon, locked).  Step 4. Alice (offline) send the message 04 to Bob, which is not sent; instead, appears the 'Tap for SMS fallback' tab (dark green balloon, locked), and Alice clicks 'No' in the box 'Fallback to SMS?', so appears the red triangle with an exclamation mark inside icon ('Error sending message' at footnote, green balloon, locked).  Observation A: I imagine that the correct reaction should be this message remain in the queue to be sent via PUSH later when the phone is online again, instead of being dismissed as a permanent error.  Step 5. Alice (online) send the message 05 to Bob, which seems to have been delivered (blue balloon, locked).  Step 6. Alice (offline) send the message 06 to Bob, which is not sent; unlike other times, the 'Tap for SMS fallback' tab appeared no more; instead, the message stayed in a sort of pending status (dark blue balloon, reticence ... and locked at footnote); however, the message details advises the following: 'Transport: PUSH'.  Observation B: as we all know, the messages sent correctly, instead of dark blue and exhibit reticence and locked, are normal blue and reports the time and locked.  Observation C: the great crash happens from now on, because the 'Tap for SMS fallback' tab will appear nevermore in the session (window) established with Bob.  Observation D: the 'Tap for SMS fallback' keeps appearing to other contacts, but if the chosen option is 'Yes', unlike other times, when the message was sent via SMS, now the message stayed in another sort of pending status (dark green balloon, reticence ... and locked at footnote); however, this time (different of the step 6) the message details advises the following: 'Transport: PENDING'.  If you thought that this was a problem, you have not seen anything. The terror begins now.  Step 7. Alice, hungry for try to make her TextSecure return to normal, have an insight which will make her to repent forever. She goes to Settings and unselect the option '[  ] TextSecure users'. So, Alice performs other tests sending messages, go back to Settings again, and reset (selecting again) the option '[v] TextSecure users': hell begins!  Observation E: from now on, an instability appears in her contact list; when she clicks Bob, opens Joshua; when clicks Joshua, open Darwin; when clicks Charlie, open Charlie himself (correctly); when clicks Bob another time, open Bob himself, or not, or even not open! Alice already restarted the TextSecure, but the bug continues. It seems to have provoked an inconsistency in some index, do not know.  Buddies, that's my 2 cents for now, ok? I believe it is important to say that my friends who are coming to TextSecure as a client of SMS mainly (for now), are having a bad experience because it is absolutely not clear how to send a simple SMS, you know.

Friend is presented with the following message:  Bad encrypted message...  I would gladly supply you guys with a log but TextSecure doesn't seem to support this feature.

"","482","Optionally allow all messages to continue to standard SMS database for use by other apps","Feature request: Could TextSecure have an option to pass the encrypted SMS message (or preferably dummy replacements like ""TextSecure encrypted [SMS/MMS]"") into the standard database?   This may fix the issue for applications which read the standard SMS database history for accounting and would allow messaging history (but not decrypted text)  to be viewed in the standard SMS client. It would also allow Tasker to perform actions on SMS arrival (again without access to the decrypted text).  UI options could change a radio buttons such as: o Use only TextSecure for SMS messages o Use only TextSecure for encrypted SMS messages o Use TextSecure and standard delivery for SMS  Rationale: Inbound encrypted SMS messages don't trigger Tasker notifications, and outbound messages don't seem to appear in my DroidStats SMS accounting. Similarly neither inbound or outbound encrypted messages appear in the default messenger (cyanogenmod).  Unencrypted text messages seem to trigger Tasker fine on arrival, presumably after being checked by TS.  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/8 has note that there's no standard API for writing to the SMS database, but I hope (possibly uninformed) it'd be possible to allow the SMS message to continue the regular delivery path (as is the case with unencrypted text) after TextSecure sees it.  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/464 notes that TextSecure can't use the standard SMS DB for its own storage, however it may be acceptable to have (encrypted or dummy) messages stored in both.  https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/324 seems to be the reverse of this request - I'd like to be able to have TextSecure not intercept encrypted text if desired.  Here in Australia SMS messages potentially cost $US 0.30 - 0.50 after hitting a ""cap"" and as TextSecure is potentially sending SMS silently for key exchange or having SMS broken into multiple messages after encryption could lead to ""bill shock"" for users not aware of it.  Apologies if this has already been raised - I didn't see anything directly suggesting this. EDIT: Typo","closed","","Apposite","2013-12-14T22:51:49Z","2013-12-17T23:25:54Z"

"","854","Option to warn when falling back to SMS","Falling back is an useful feature to have turned on. However, I could think of several scenarios when the ""silent"" falling back behavior is not desired: - When I send a message to a friend oversea and TextSecure is not available for that person: I will get charged a lot when the app silently falls back and proceeds to send the text oversea. - When I send a message to a friend because I expected the friend to have TextSecure but actually they had turned it off for some reason: That means my communication is no longer secret. Imagine I am about to send something assuming it will be send securely, but at the moment the app sends it, it decides to falls back silently.  I think an non-intrusive way to implement this is to warn the user in-line (in the chat message area) that the message cannot be delivered securely (or cannot be delivered securely anymore), and ask the user to tap the send button again to confirm sending it. They would have to tap the send button again to send that message in the insecure mode. Of course they only have to tap twice to switch from secure -> insecure once. The next time they would have to tap only once since they already knew it.  Of course, I think not everyone wants this feature, so I think it's sensible to have an option to warn the user, but have that turned off by default.","closed","","htruong","2014-02-27T23:41:16Z","2014-02-28T01:56:44Z"

"","1106","Push-Service for Custom ROMs without GCM","Dear @moxie0, as much as I enjoy using TextSecure as a complete replacement for the standard SMS app, I am not happy with the registration process for the Push-Service of TextSecure. To be specific, I am running [AOKP](http://www.aokp.co) and TextSecure tells me that registering with the Push-Service is not possible without having the Google PlayStore-App installed. To be very clear about this: Google Play will NEVER EVER gain permission to land on my phone. The way I see it, being required to install Google Play (in my eyes one of the most dangerous privacy-breaking apps out there) just to be able to use the Push-Service of TextSecure (which focuses on PRIVACY) is like a snake biting its own tail. I guess TextSecure utiltizes Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), and as such Google Play is ""absolutely necessary"", am I right?  Don't get me wrong: Using TextSecure feels awesome. It just does feel that way leaving WhatsApp behind and knowing that TextSecure is being recommended by [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/apps) and can be safely relied on to protect my data. But having to have Google Play just feels wrong. My intention is to DITCH Google completely (except for Android Custom ROMs) in the long run, not creating yet another tie for myself. So why don't we make an effort to find an alternative for this crappy Google Cloud Messaging?","closed","","SecUpwN","2014-03-09T23:06:44Z","2015-12-27T20:49:43Z"

This is at least the safest way, but there are other ways to do this nearly as secure as this. You could e.g. talk with someone on the phone, who dictates his fingerprint, so that you can confirm it by simply checking, if the code he's dictating matches the one, your phone is showing. So there should be an option, to confirm another ones fingerprint by simply telling the app ""Yes, I've checked/confirmed the fingerprint of my opposite."" This would be similar to the way PGP fingerprint exchanges can work.","closed","feature,","Phyioa","2014-02-27T12:57:13Z","2016-04-16T11:53:34Z"

"","681","Improve CyanogenMod onboarding during setup","Currently the CyanogenMod TextSecure setup process is very opaque about what exactly TextSecure will do, and how it will use SMS.  This is a problem because anyone who pays per message needs and wants to know exactly what's going to happen if they start using this app in a chatty way - will it send a lot of SMS, none, some? When?  The CM setup for TextSecure needs to make it very clear that SMS will _not_ be sent between TextSecure devices, and also make it easy to ensure that SMS will _not_ be sent without TextSecure prompting to do so.  I have repeatedly disabled TextSecure when installing CM because these facts are not made clear at setup, and I already use WhatsApp - whereas, having now learned about how TextSecure works, it seems like a much better improvement for me then WhatsApp while providing the same functionality.","closed","","wrouesnel","2014-02-25T12:56:35Z","2014-02-25T17:06:47Z"

With the update to 4.4 they changed the way Android handles SMS programs and the programmers pushed out a change that fixed the ""break"" they caused (for which I am grateful) but in doing so there is now no longer a way to enable MMS messages for TextSecure and it is still ignoring them (I've had several sent to me and not gotten a notification or indication of them at all).  I'm curious if someone can tell me what CONF file I would need to edit and what change i might need to make to restore MMS functionality so that I can try the various MMS settings to see what works (I'm on AT&T LTE if anyone has any suggestions on that).  Whereas previously TextSecure would tell me I had a MMS and then simply fail to download it, it currently ignores them entirely.  My guess is that the new change doesn't check to see if TextSecure had MMS disabled previously.  You may want to add a bit of code to check for that - though I confess I'm likely in a small group of users who will ever experience this problem.","closed","","Blenster","2013-12-06T23:24:15Z","2013-12-07T21:45:53Z"

While I was at it, I added support for x86 processors; I believe there are at least some x86 Android smartphones out there (+ for development, there is an x86 Android emulator, which is faster to run on Intel PCs).  This will generate one APK with all native libraries inside. There is also the possibility to use Gradle flavors to create one distinct APK for each architecture; I can change the code to do that instead, if you want.  I also fixed some typos which were causing build warnings and updated to the lastest build tools.  _Note_: I thought you wouldn't like me checking in the binaries, so if you want people to be able to build without having the NDK installed (as it was the case previously), it is still necessary to build and check in the native components in `library/libs`.

My diagnosis could be wrong - the ""go prey"" txt didn't work for me and appeared to have been swallowed by TextSecure, Googling the problem gave confirmation bias)","closed","","Treer","2014-01-13T15:08:04Z","2014-01-13T16:39:18Z"

TextSecure works swimmingly for sending encrypted or unencrypted SMS. However, sending MMS doesn't work for me despite my tinkering. If I try to attach media to a message, such as a picture, the client displays a message showing that it sent, but the destination never receives the message nor any trace of it. In case it was a size issue, I tried sending a tiny 28.8KB image to a number of different destinations, but each time it displayed the same results. TextSecure claimed it was sent successfully but none of the recipients received the message. I have tried leaving the MMS settings at the default as well as specifying my own. The settings I tried are:  MMSC http://mmsc.mobile.att.net Proxy proxy.mobile.att.net Port 80  At no point in my attempts did I ever encounter an error. Receiving MMS is also weird. I would receive notification that there was a message when using the default settings, but every time I tried to Download the message, it failed. After specifying the above MMS settings, I successfully received the message 2 out of 3 times.  Am I missing something? Any suggestions? Any additional information I can grab that might help narrow down the issue? Apologies again if my approach/formatting is crap.","closed","","Wayren","2014-02-24T22:27:26Z","2014-08-22T00:15:31Z"

Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time.

I had sent out two messages in the meantime: the first over push, the second over encrypted SMS.  The SMS was received by my friend, but got stuck in ""Decrypting, please wait..."", see bug #240. No Push message was shown as received.  After TextSecure restart, the SMS was decrypted. But the push message never showed up and seems to be lost. I'm wildly guessing that while SMS receive was stuck, the Push message was still stuck in processing queue (albeit being sent out first; but it was probably received later than the SMS), and after app restart it was just gone. The SMS was seemingly cached to be available and decryptable after app force close, but the GCM message wasn't.","closed","","Natanji","2014-02-25T17:30:42Z","2014-02-25T18:56:23Z"

"","791","Changing Phone Number doesn't work","A friend and I try to chat via TextSecure. I am located in Germany, he is located in England. Because he is from Germany originally, he still had my German number without the international prefix in his phone book. Now, when I wrote him, he could not answer me.  Then, he changed my phone number in his address book to include the international prefix and he hit ""Update Directory"". Still, we cannot chat since TextSecure tries to use the number without the prefix.  I think two things are amiss here: First, when I send him a message, TextSecure should be able to answer regardless of the number he has in his phone book. I.e., TextSecure should see that the message came from a phone number +49 ... and answer to that number (potentially telling him that this is not the number associated with my contact, i.e. someone could be trying to spoof him).  Second, of course TextSecure should notice the change in telephone numbers and update the contact accordingly.  I think both could be solved if TextSecure just _always_ used the numbers with international prefix. Since all users registered with the server (and used their international number with it), the international prefix is known and used during sync. Why not just use it?","closed","","tinloaf","2014-02-26T20:26:57Z","2014-07-16T13:23:41Z"

The view at this point is a blank conversation window (no recipient) and the message prefilled. There are two issues: 1. Alice was previously looking at Bob's conversation and it would be good to follow the convention of showing the last thing Alice saw in the app. Hangouts does this. 2. If Alice re-enters Bob's number, the send icon is for an unsecured message, even though when Alice hits send it is in fact an encrypted message and is appended to the existing conversation.

"","1287","not all SMS shown in app","(This might be an Android bug, not a TS bug but I've only seen it with TS)  I have the latest Play store release of TS installed and have it configured as my default SMS app. I had TS import the existing message store and everything shows up in TS just fine. The app also appears to send and receive both SMS and MMS just fine for me. However, I noticed that if I send an SMS outside of TS, the message isn't shown inside TS (I assume because it writes to the default message store and not TS's). Example: if I use Google Now and say 'ok google, text my wife' and send her a text through this mechanism, the message is sent and the little card that pops up saying it was sent shows TS as the default messaging app and opens TS when you click it _but_ the message I just sent is _not_ shown in TS. If I make Hangouts the default app again temporarily then I see the message no problem. I also have an app called Agent that detects when I'm driving and responds to incoming SMS with an SMS of its own saying that I'm driving and that I'll contact them later. These messages also do not show up in TS, but become visible when I switch back to Hangouts.  It would appear that TS uses its own message store for all messages and does not synchronize with the default Android message store after the initial import. I seem to recall another issue here on GitHub where someone was asking for an unencrypted message store and an encrypted one and after thinking about it, I think if TS would use the default message store for ""normal"" unencrypted SMS/MMS then that would solve both that request and the issue present here. I understand that makes the codebase more difficult though as there are two code paths accessing two different message stores..  Is my assessment of why the messages are not shown in TS correct? Is this by design? Can we rectify this? I just know that if I'd convinced my wife to use TS as her default app and then she couldn't find a message that she sent she'd never trust TS and would uninstall it in a heartbeat. If we're going to 'sell' our friends on TS as a 'drop in replacement' for whatever messaging app they currently use, it has to show _all_ messages sent/received by them.","closed","","hunleyd","2014-04-03T18:16:14Z","2014-04-03T18:29:00Z"

"","1172","Alternative model to visualize security in TS","### I. Introduction  Currently near consensus has been reached in these issues about implementing a visual security model in TS: #910, #945, #766 and #741. In my oppinion this model has some problems which I'd like discuss here and propose a different model. I created this issue because right now there is no chance to change the course of the discussion in the mentioned issues. So I chose to not interfere any further, let the participants improve their model and work on an alternative model separately.  ### II. Criticism of the proposed model  This is the visual model as proposed in the aforementioned issues.  ##### Contact list  I had to make this up myself based on #741. And yes, this has been done with MS Paint: ![contact-list-with locks1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428418/bb727eb2-ac46-11e3-9d88-e84acd5fbac4.png) ##### Messaging window  ![4](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428409/7e1cc54a-ac46-11e3-9430-5338739b0c08.jpg) ![3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428410/7e247664-ac46-11e3-8fe7-449465b7b6f5.jpg) ![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428411/7e29f9e0-ac46-11e3-88fb-e3ce0df4ef09.jpg) ![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428412/7e2f288e-ac46-11e3-8e99-bf421b45bc3b.jpg) ##### Message history  As far as I know this is still missing, at least I didn't find a specific issue about it and therefore didn't find any screenshots. ##### Discussion 1. There is no coherent visual security schema for TS. We need one schema for all these three areas in TS: contact list, message history, messaging window. 2. Too much information and too much redundancy which leads to a cluttered and less usable interface. There is no ""security at one glance"".  3. The icons under each message are too small. Visually impaired people might not even notice them. Those symbols don't increase with the chosen text size. Also, depending on the colour, the icons under each message are hard to read because the contrast is too low. Another issue with those icons is that there could be issues on smaller screens with less dpi. 4. The lock symbol used on the contact list doesn't visualize the idea of three security levels well enough. Threema's indicator does so by telling the user that there are three levels and contrasting it with how many he already has achieved. I think this schema also presents an incentive to gain better security which the uni-coloured lock symbol doesn't. ### III. The alternative model  I have used Threema's dots to implement the security indicator but I have also ""designed"" some other possible indicators (see below). Maybe it's not even possible to use Threema's dots due to legal reasons. This is only an example.   Bear with me, I really don't know my way around a real graphics program so this is all done with MS Paint... ;)  ##### Contact list  ![contact-list - kopie](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428435/0c95c7bc-ac48-11e3-9b1e-2121ae85c152.png) ##### Messaging window  ![messaging window](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428433/0c7fd6d2-ac48-11e3-94c6-716cc49d1f74.png) ##### Message history  ![message-history](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428434/0c859752-ac48-11e3-9684-bfbca26a338e.png) ##### Short explanation of how this model works:  First of: Threema doesn't use SMS, so TS has an enhanced model and more use cases.  Level 1 (red): The user is communicating via SMS. It doesn't matter if the number of his contact is already in his contact list. As far as I know, SMS can be easily fabricated so it doesn't even matter if the user receives encrypted SMS, because the other party could be anybody, at least as long as there has been no verification of keys. So whether the user is communicationg via encrypted or unencrypted SMS, with the number in his address book or not, doesn't matter. The only possibility to communicate securely over SMS is to use TS with a verified contact, which would result in a green indicator.  Level 2 (orange): This is for push messages that come from contacts in the usuer's address book which are not yet verified. Encryption is being used. **EDIT:** We should award SMS an orange indicator if there have been previous push messages and we already know that the key is connected to that number. In the case where a SMS reaches our phone from somebody unknown to us, this SMS will still have a red indicator.  Level 3 (green): The user has verified the contact from his contact list and uses encryption.  ##### Discussion: 1. Only one message colour for everything. Message colour doesn't resemble security any more, only the security indicator does. The message colour can be any colour we choose and it should be customizable in the future anyway. Though the colour should probably not be the green, orange or red of the security indicator so that people don't get confused. Also we need better contrast with the timestamp. 2. The user can understand the security level with one glance at the security indicator. No locks, no verification badges and no transport symbols under the messages. No tiny symbols, that can't be ready by visually impaired people or won't be displayed correctly on lew-res screens. Colour-vision impaired people can still see which security level is being used.     This leaves more room for what the user actually wants: communicating. I think we are too much in his face, constantly displaying something. Under each message there will only be a timestamp. I think there should be a warning message if a contact with two numbers (one of them isn't registered with TS) talks to the user and the security changes. Only switching to a red indicator probably doesn't cut it. Again, the indicator always tells you the security of your _next_ message. If you want to know the security of your last messages, you will have to tap and hold on a message so that you can access message details.  3. Not displaying transportation under each message might be unwise, because users who pay for SMS or Data depending on usage really want to know what TS is doing. I think the solution to this is asking the user at first start how TS should handle this. As far as I know this will be or already has been integrated into TS so we probably don't have to worry about it that much. This means either TS is not allowed to act in a way that would cost the user money or TS will ask the user what to do. The way of transportation will always be in sight, though, because the text in the message composing area will always display whether the next message will be a SMS or push message. The only thing that I would wish somebody would add is that I could allow TS to use SMS for 15min, a few hours or a day, but ask me again once this time is over.  4. The paperlane doesn't have a lock anymore either. ### IV. Some ideas for security indicators  This indicator needs to convey three levels of security and the user should always get the idea that more is better.   Again, purely MS paint.    This is taken from Google Chrome: ![chrome-indicator - enlarged](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428440/832c158e-ac48-11e3-8d30-dc178543e605.png)  This is the modified TS icon: ![textsecure-icon-indicator-small](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6848629/2428439/8325c01c-ac48-11e3-9b07-cca384f61647.png)  Can anybody think of more? ### V. Conclusion  Ok, this is the model I wanted to propose. Feedback is very welcome. It would also help a lot if somebody could just make new, more professional looking mockups of the screenshots.","closed","","ArthurusDent","2014-03-15T14:05:27Z","2014-05-08T12:16:09Z"
