"","3896","Test failed due to locale message settings. (with non-English locale settings)","With a non-English locale settings (in my case is zh-CN), running [CheckerTest#testHaltOnExceptionOff](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/CheckerTest.java#L756) will assert an error as following: ``` org.junit.ComparisonFailure: error message 0  Expected :path/to/checkstyle/src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/InputMain.java:0: Got an exception - java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: test Actual   :path/to/checkstyle/src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/InputMain.java:0: 异常 - java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: test  // something else... ``` The difference is between `Got an exception` and `异常`, while `异常` is a Chinese translation of `Got an exception`.   I find that these two words are defined in [messages.properties](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/messages.properties#L2) and [messages_zh.properties](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/messages_zh.properties#L2).  In messages.properties ``` general.exception=Got an exception - {0} ``` In messages_zh.properties ``` general.exception=异常 - {0} ```  And the configuration is loaded by [LocalizedMessage](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/LocalizedMessage.java#L43). We can set the locale manually by [LocalizedMessage#setLocale](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/LocalizedMessage.java#L363) and this method is called by [Checker](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Checker.java#L407). I thought setting the locale in the test method should solve the bug. ``` @Override     public void finishLocalSetup() throws CheckstyleException {         final Locale locale = new Locale(localeLanguage, localeCountry);         LocalizedMessage.setLocale(locale); ```  So back to the error itself. In method `CheckerTest#testHaltOnExceptionOff`, I set the locale by adding  ``` checker.setLocaleLanguage(Locale.ENGLISH.getLanguage()); checker.finishLocalSetup(); ``` and the test in Intellij turns green after that.  But the same error still occurs when I run `mvn clean verify` in Terminal: ``` Failed tests:   CheckerTest.testHaltOnExceptionOff:780->BaseCheckTestSupport.verify:231->BaseCheckTestSupport.verify:262 error message 0 expected: but was: ```  That's the most effort I could do by now. I don't know what to do next. The bug bothers me a lot for I could not use `mvn clean verify` to ensure my change is valid before sending a PR.

"","3493","Checker Cache and TranslationCheck conflict","While looking into #3487 with fix #3489, I noticed there is an issue with skipping certain files in checks that require all files to be passed to them to make final determinations on if there was any violations. The cache prevents a file from being passed at all to a check, as the cache is checked before sending it to the checks via `Checker.processFile`. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/4b7adec5ae396e24d3d0bf0d790919a45bac5421/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Checker.java#L261 `TranslationCheck` looks at multiple files, and only does any validation after all the files are given to it: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/4b7adec5ae396e24d3d0bf0d790919a45bac5421/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/TranslationCheck.java#L245-L246 and https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/4b7adec5ae396e24d3d0bf0d790919a45bac5421/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/TranslationCheck.java#L250-L259  Processing 1 file and skipping others will cause it to falsely believe that files are missing and report excess violations, even when no violations on a non-cache run exist. This is because we don't guess were the files are, we use the files reported to the check to know where they are and if they exist.  Steps to reproduce on CS locally: **0) Fixes for the above referenced issues need to be applied for proper reproduction** 1) Clean target directory of any cache file. 2) Run checkstyle's ant-phase-verify with cache on. No violations are produced but cache file is created 3) Open the cache file in a standard text editor and delete one property file from the cache. This will simulate that one file is being modified and the others staying the same without actually changing any files. For this example, I choose `\src\main\resources\com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\checks\naming\messages_es.properties`. 4) Run checkstyle again and this time 8 violations are reported, even though no files were modified and we got no violations on our first run in step 2.

"","3566","Cache conflict between Maven/Ant and Eclipse/CLI run","While finishing up #3487, I noticed that running Checkstyle through Maven and CLI kept causing the cache to be erased. When looking into it, the main differences was the hash for the configuration.  Since I am using the exact same configuration, properties, settings, etc on the same workspace, I am expecting the 2 to work together, generate the same hash, and not keep erasing the cache when running the 2.  By default, when CLI runs a check with the check's severity as `ignore`, the check is still processed but [violations are not printed by the `DefaultLogger`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/5e0ab75777985f056715f6d9dc5e4667b1a0dfa2/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/DefaultLogger.java#L121) (which is also [the same as `XMLLogger`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/5e0ab75777985f056715f6d9dc5e4667b1a0dfa2/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/XMLLogger.java#L120)). This is why they still appear as part of the configuration hash. `maven-checkstyle-plugin` currently uses it's own version of the CLI so it still processes ignored checks like our CLI. Ant run skips ignored checks because of `omitIgnoredModules` which is the heart of the problem. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/fbf3f95c2273be23b966cba6e6ef89390a6fb020/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/ant/CheckstyleAntTask.java#L111  Users don't expect checks with a configured severity of `ignore` on the check itself to be run, so this is how our CLI and Ant should be by default.  In terms of what this issue should do:  1) We should add the option `omitIgnoredModules` to the CLI. It should default to on (TRUE) (like Ant), but can be turned off. 2) All our uses in our ANT configs of `omitIgnoredModules` should be turned off (FALSE). We want to run every check to be a sort-of no-exception validation. 3) We should make a request to `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to add the property `omitIgnoredModules` so users can specify it, and so we can make sure it stays off (FALSE) by default. 4) Do similar requests to Eclipse-CS and IntelijIdea plugins.","closed","breaking compatibility,","rnveach","2016-11-19T03:01:05Z","2017-06-19T21:54:10Z"

"","3796","Remove unnecessary text from Javadoc tokens","When looking at some example Javadoc trees, I noticed if the javadoc is pretty big, we almost duplicate the entire contents multiple times in various nodes. We don't see this in the Java tree but this is mostly because of the differences between antlr2 and antlr4. One example of simplicity is `CLASS_DEF` in java where we just repeat the token name as the text. I still think there is too much being displayed in Javadoc tree and that we should limit this text by following the Java version and just repeating the token name.  Example: Javadoc: `/** Test Test. */` Tree: ````     |  |  |  |  `--JAVADOC ->  Test Test.  [2:3]     |  |  |  |      |--TEXT ->  [2:3]     |  |  |  |      |--HTML_ELEMENT -> Test [2:4]     |  |  |  |      |  `--PARAGRAPH -> Test [2:4]     |  |  |  |      |      |--P_TAG_OPEN ->  [2:4]     |  |  |  |      |      |  |--OPEN -> < [2:4]     |  |  |  |      |      |  |--P_HTML_TAG_NAME -> p [2:5]     |  |  |  |      |      |  `--CLOSE -> > [2:6]     |  |  |  |      |      |--TEXT -> Test [2:7]     |  |  |  |      |      `--P_TAG_CLOSE ->  [2:11]     |  |  |  |      |          |--OPEN -> < [2:11]     |  |  |  |      |          |--SLASH -> / [2:12]     |  |  |  |      |          |--P_HTML_TAG_NAME -> p [2:13]     |  |  |  |      |          `--CLOSE -> > [2:14]     |  |  |  |      |--TEXT ->  Test.  [2:15]     |  |  |  |      `--EOF ->  [2:22] ````  In this example, I would say the following tokens have unnecessary text: JAVADOC (a complete repeat of the entire javadoc), HTML_ELEMENT, PARAGRAPH, P_TAG_OPEN, P_TAG_CLOSE We would have to review the all the tokens and find a common rule to how we should apply this, especially for future tokens.  Right now, it might look like that any token that has children shouldn't have text.","closed","breaking compatibility,","rnveach","2017-02-03T23:59:32Z","2017-06-21T13:09:41Z"

We’d like to format them in [the canonical way](http://jmockit.org/tutorial/Mocking.html#expectation), but we get a checkstyle error:  ```java     @Test     public void testFoo(@Mocked Object mock) {         new Expectations() {{             mock.toString(); //  'block' child have incorrect indentation level 12, expected level should be one of the following: 16, 20.  As a workaround, we could simply indent the block contents an extra level, but then they appear to be indented too far—not just to our eyes, but to our IDEs as well.  So instead, we currently waste 2 lines (in addition to the extra indentation level) and write:  ```java     @Test     public void testFoo(@Mocked Object mock) {         new Expectations() {             {                 mock.toString(); // passes             }         };     } ```  I don’t know the best way to solve this. One way that wouldn’t require any new configuration options would be to always expect the indentation within an instance initializer block to be one level deeper than the line that opens the block. That way both of the code snippets above would pass.  If you’ve never seen instance initializer blocks before, you can read more about them [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html) and [here](http://www.programcreek.com/2011/10/java-class-instance-initializers/).","open","indentation,","2is10","2017-01-18T20:54:57Z","2017-02-03T17:50:03Z"

One enhancement that would be very helpful would be to allow the matching group values to be available for inclusion in violation messages.  Right now, the {0} message param yields the regex itself, which can be quite long and hard to understand.  Here is one example:  ```                                                                       ```  The regex matches on an annotation with an extra ""value="".  The first matching group holds the name of the annotation and the second, the full attribute name-value pair.  It could be useful to have {1} be the first matching group value, {2} the second and so on.  Then the message could be something like `Superflous ''value='' should be removed from annotation {1}`.  This could provide clarity if there were more annotations on the same line and also if there are a lot of violations in a project. ##","open","","eric-milles","2016-05-22T19:31:45Z","2016-12-14T18:17:17Z"

Processing 1 file and skipping others will cause it to falsely believe that files are missing and report excess violations, even when no violations on a non-cache run exist. This is because we don't guess were the files are, we use the files reported to the check to know where they are and if they exist.  Steps to reproduce on CS locally: 1) Clean target directory of any cache file. 2) Run checkstyle's ant-phase-verify with cache on. No violations are produced but cache file is created 3) Add '.' to any value at `\src\main\resources\com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\checks\naming\messages_es.properties`. 4) Run checkstyle again and this time 8 violations are reported, even though no files were modified and we got no violations on our first run in step 2.

Antlr classes could conflict with another dependencies of application. Dependencies to any other third party is also not desirable.  from discussion with eclipse-cs author: "" Checkstyle itself gains little to nothing from restricting packages. However in OSGI context a bundle (e.g. checkstyle-core) needs declare which of it's packages are visible to extensions. Today this includes all of Checkstyle's packages and Checkstyle's own dependenceis (antlr, guava, commons-*).  The downside of this in OSGI realm is that those packages are now visible not just to Checkstyle extensions but also do unrelated plugins, which potentially import one of the 3rd-party packages. This can lead to nasty class version conflicts in unexpected places, e.g. the Checkstyle plugin can potentially break a different plugin.

"","3015","NPE in CheckUtil#getCheckMessage","This is all about test area of our code and how `AllChecksTest.testAllCheckstyleMessages` method works.  'getCheckMessages' method from 'CheckUtil' (from test area of code) class uses 'getResourceAsStream' from Class (java's native library) which loads resource ('messages.properties') as a stream as it is described at http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/8u40-b25/java/lang/Class.java#2215  It means that if we use messages from resource bundle which is not in the same package as the target class, 'getResourceAsStream' does not load the bundle's content (it loads only the content of resource bundle associated with the current class loader). It leads to NPE in 'CheckUtil#getCheckMessage' here:  ``` java public static String getCheckMessage(Class module, String messageKey, Object... arguments) {   ...   final MessageFormat formatter = new MessageFormat(pr.getProperty(messageKey), Locale.ROOT);   ... } ```  Example: there are two property keys ('general.fileNotFound' and 'general.exception') which are used in Tranlation#logIoException. The message resources for the keys are inside `src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/messages.properties` resource bundle. In the current implementation of TranslationCheck we use the keys as string literals, because we cannot extract them to the constants due to NPE in CheckUtil#getCheckMessage and failing of 'testAllCheckstyleMessages' as a result.","closed","","MEZk","2016-03-08T08:01:12Z","2016-03-23T12:49:27Z"

Should `java.lang.reflect` be allowed anywhere? I think not, so I suggest we make it local-only in the top package (it is used in `PackageObjectFactory`) and add other local-only allowance only where needed.  - `java.nio.charset.Charset` is redundantly allowed in `checks.header`: `java.nio `is already globally allowed in the top package. I assume we want to allow `java.nio` everywhere and can simply remove the redundant allow?  - Thanks to #3724 we can remove allowances for imports only used in test code. This will be done in #3724 for Guava, but other unnecessary rules might also be left over. I will find them all and remove them if possible.","closed","miscellaneous,","jochenvdv","2017-01-18T15:18:51Z","2017-02-13T03:38:39Z"

Unfortunately, it is not possible to override `Checker` as the CLI hardcodes `Checker` as the class to run. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/fbf3f95c2273be23b966cba6e6ef89390a6fb020/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Main.java#L414  It was already implied this was possible [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/2221#issuecomment-254015954), but it is actually not.  > If logic is complicated and does not satisfy already configured Checker, create a new Checker and custom Check and do whatever user want.  I think we should get the main module to run from the configuration XML so it can be customized without having to also rewrite the CLI.

"","3891","Split and Organize Checkstyle inputs by Test","Taken from https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/3887#discussion_r103765963  It makes it hard to review changes to one Check when multiple Checks are using the same input file and users modify that one file. It makes sense, imo, to add new stuff to an existing input file for simple fixes instead of always creating a new one.  We already restrict inputs to only be used by tests in a single folder. We should take this further and restrict inputs to a single test so no 2 tests use the same input file.  **Each PR should be one single Test class and it's inputs for quicker review, unless an admin has specified otherwise.**  We should start by renaming all inputs to `Input[SimpleTestName].*` (`[]`s are just for separation and should not be in final file name),  that are used by a test. If test is named `ParenPadCheckTest`, simple name would be `ParenPad` and input would start with `InputParenPad`. Any text can be appended to the end to make the input file name unique among others for the same test.  Each test's inputs should be alone in their own directory. If Test was in directory `.../checks/design` then inputs should be located in `.../checks/design/[SimpleTestName]` (`[]`s are just for separation and should not be in final file name). Folder names should be in all lowercase. Files should be moved to their new locations unless they are used by other checks. If that is the case, then the files should be copied over until all tests have their inputs separated. No input should be left without a test.  We expect no changes to the test's expected violation positions (line or column number). If that does happen because of any of the requested changes, then some of the changes need to be undone. If violation changes because of class rename, then class name and file name must be left unchanged but package rename and moving to new folder can still be done.

Every update requires to have a new URL with a date attached to the end.  We should drop this person-specific, manual process and find a way so anyone can do it with a PR.  I am recommending we put the HTML file under Git control, somewhere probably in our `site` directory so it is naturally deployed with each release. It should remain as a pure HTML file. It shouldn't require a rename every release, so the URL never needs to be changed. Since it is under Git, we can just look in the history to look at old versions if we need to and easily see what has changed.  Additionally we need to resolve potential problems of missed updates , see example https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/4053#pullrequestreview-27761092 . We should have only one version of guide html file - reports/google-java-style.html .  Ideal solution will be to keep absolute copy of html file from google repo (with all their css and other stuff)","closed","easy,","rnveach","2017-03-12T01:42:21Z","2020-02-23T01:01:36Z"

The fix in the previous issue invalidated `branchTokenTypes` cache but it did not invalidate `childCount` which was also in issue's description. Since we also cache `childCount` and don't reset it on add/set children/siblings methods, it will keep count from non-comment trees into comment trees, as long as we don't call `setFirstChild` which is the only method to invalidate it currently. To avoid calling `setFirstChild`, issue can be seen with code samples like `public /* comment */ static void method () {}` where a comment/javadoc is between 2 other similar nodes.  In previous issue's fix, `getChildCount` was called on `METHOD_DEF` in UT while the comments are located as a child of `MODIFIERS` in input. So the UT in that fix isn't directed at the correct location to showcase the `getChildCount` issue.

The problem is if I want to create a new check that specifically looks at only methods, there is no way to override the parser to exclude non-methods. `visitToken` is declared `final`, which is the only way to intercept the parsing. [The xdoc examples also show the only way to process just methods is to do the work inside `visitJavadocToken`](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/writingjavadocchecks.html#Access_Java_AST_from_Javadoc_Check). Depending on the javdoc tokens being used and how many occurrences there are, this could be a lot of wasted CPU skipping unwanted Javadocs. Not to mention any wasted time just creating the Javadoc tree if this was the only check in the config.  IMO, I think we should make `isCorrectJavadocPosition` non-static and allow it to be overridden by the check implementation. We should rename it to something like `shouldProcessJavadoc` so it is clear this is how you control what javadocs to process. We should also show this in the xdoc, and show examples on how to check each specific member (class, method, field, etc.).","open","","rnveach","2017-02-23T15:15:49Z","2017-02-23T15:16:10Z"

Requested: - Type of generics should be also checked against known immutable classes   - For example, `Optional keyword` or `ImmutableMap perfValues` or `ImmutableMap perfSeries` should be considered OK, while `ImmutableMap perfSeries` should not be considered as immutable field. - Currently if you add immutable class which happens to have generic type (like `java.util.Optional`) check allows you to create public fields with mutable type (although mutability is slightly restricted by container, i.e. `ImmutableSet` or `Optional`) - It will be nice to have TextArea with automatical word-wrapping instead of TextField in check's configuration window","closed","approved,","KTannenberg","2016-04-28T12:55:26Z","2016-06-10T17:38:45Z"

For example:  https://github.com/oracle/atg-build-tools/blob/master/atg-maven-plugin/src/main/java/com/oracle/atg/ateam/RunAssemblerMojo.java  Classes with no contents require no blank lines:  ``` public class SomeClass {} ```  Could Checkstyle please feature a rule that enforces n (0, 1, 2, ...) blank lines in this context?  There appears to be a rule for enforcing a blank line at the beginning of class declarations, but I can't find one to enforce a blank line at the end as well. ##","closed","","mcandre","2016-07-29T20:03:00Z","2022-01-14T12:04:36Z"
"","3708","Strive for 100% mutation coverage","Now that we implemented `pitest` in #3271, we should try to increase [the mutation coverage for our different checks](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/fde083d175b6032b1bc9c9e08e01e109739ff820/pom.xml#L1473-L1784).  Currently, `header` package has the lowest percentage at 78%, followed by `metrics` package at 83%.  FYI: Mutation coverage means a test should prove a line of production code exists. Mutation fails if a line or production code is distorted but no unchanged tests fail. At least one test should fail if production code is changed somehow.  Attention: it is recommended to start with the most easy to fix cases to raise level close to 100%. Only as we reach 100% we could guaranty no leak in testing. It would be better ti finish packages that executed less in time make them 100% and group them in one profile.  To run report on `blocks` package (profiles are exists for all packages): `mvn clean verify -Ppitest-checks-blocks org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`  Current state: ``` $ grep -E ""pitest-checks|mutationThreshold"" pom.xml | sed -E ""s/(|)//g""       pitest-checks-blocks               97       pitest-checks-coding               93       pitest-checks-design               98       pitest-checks-header               78       pitest-checks-imports               94       pitest-checks-indentation               94       pitest-checks-javadoc               95       pitest-checks-metrics               83       pitest-checks-modifier               100       pitest-checks-naming               98       pitest-checks-regexp               93       pitest-checks-sizes               94       pitest-checks-whitespace               96 ```","closed","medium,","rnveach","2017-01-10T16:05:44Z","2018-12-17T14:11:48Z"
"","3408","Improve check messages","Note: This is a follow-up of PR #3404 in which I improved the German translation (and for which I have thoroughly read all messages not only in German, but also in English).  **Context**: Checkstyle displays warnings for occurrences in the checked code that don't fulfill the requirement of a check. These warnings are constructed from messages that are local to checks (and defined in [/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks)). A message may have one or more parameters in order to better reflect the precise instance of a check violation.  **Problem**: The messages vary in the degree to which they satisfy certain desirable quality criteria: 1. **Understandability** – A user should be able to understand what is wrong about his code with as little previous knowledge as possible. 2. **Guidance** – A user should be able to understand what he needs to do in order to fix his code with as little further knowledge as possible. 3. **Accuracy** – The message should accurately reflect what the check verifies.  In general, it is also noteworthy to check when to use ""must"" vs ""should"" and ""must not"" vs ""should not"".  **Solution**: Messages should be improved where necessary and possible. An improvement can refer to: - Making a message **more concise** by removing superfluous information. - Making a message **more complete** by giving hints about background, consequence and/or fix. - Making a message **easier to understand** by framing it in a sentence. - Making a message **more accurate** by synchronizing with what the check actually/currently does. - Making a message **more specific** by introducing additional message parameters.  **Examples**: To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, here are some examples of messages that I reckon could be enhanced in order to significantly improve usability:  ``` properties # There could be one message per style. annotation.incorrect.style=Annotation style must be ''{0}''.  # This means: ""The last value of an annotation array element should not have a trailing comma."" annotation.trailing.comma.present=Annotation array values cannot contain trailing comma.  # This means: ""Always use @Foo() instead of @Foo for annotations"". annotation.parens.missing=Annotation must have closing parenthesis.  # This means: ""If you implement a custom #equals method, you should always override #equals(Object) [to avoid confusion]."" covariant.equals=covariant equals without overriding equals(java.lang.Object).  # This means: ""If you compare a String with a String literal, always put the literal on the left side of the equals comparison."" equals.avoid.null=String literal expressions should be on the left side of an equals comparison.  # This means: ""Always use the uppercase ""L"" when defining long values."" upperEll=Should use uppercase ''L''.  # This means: ""(Class Fan-Out Complexity) Class {2} depends on {0} other classes (max allowed is {1})."" classFanOutComplexity=Class Fan-Out Complexity is {0} (max allowed is {1}).  # This means: ""Method {2} has {0} Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS) (max allowed is {1})."" ncss.method=NCSS for this method is {0} (max allowed is {1}). ... ```  **Proposal**: If you agree that the checkstyle messages could bear some overhaul, I would volunteer and start to assemble a list of suggestions in a commit (e.g. in a PR or in a fork branch), so that people can comment on it, before we make any preliminary or final decision.","closed","","caugner","2016-08-08T22:54:35Z","2016-08-18T14:13:28Z"

"","3331","AbstractFileSetCheck: Ability to limit checks to files within path","My use case is that I would like to be able to have separate checkstyle rules for my normal code and my test code. I use maven, so that code is under src/main/java, and src/test/java respectively.  Currently I can configure my build to run checkstyle twice... once for `src/main/java`, and once for `src/test/java` with separate checkstyle configuration files.    But, it would be nice to be able to have a single configuration file.  Especially, because checkstyle plugins for IDEs tend not to give the option to specify different checkstyle configurations for different folders within a module.  Also, when generating reports it would be nice to have just the one report coming out of checkstyle; instead of two reports as a result of running it twice.  It looks to me like the simplest way to achieve this would be to add a `folderPattern` property to `AbstractFileSetCheck`, which would contain a regex that each file's path would need to match. The if condition in `AbstractFileSetCheck.processFiltered()` would be changed to filter based on the `folderPattern` as well as the existing `fileExtensions` property.  Then I would be able to write something like:  ``` xml                                                          ```  I suggest adding it to `AbstractFileSetCheck` rather than `TreeWalker`, so that this could also be used on other `FileSetCheck`s. I am suggesting the name `folderPattern` and that it be a regex for consistency with the `RegexpOnFilename` check. ##","open","","ntdaley","2016-06-29T17:14:57Z","2016-12-14T18:16:59Z"

The test uses our configuration loader to read and process the configuration file.  `TOKENS_IN_CONFIG_TO_IGNORE` will specify all tokens that we do not want defined directly in our config. `NoWhitespaceBefore` was added for demonstration but it's value is valid as we don't have those used in our config.  If we want, we can add this to all configurations (google and sun).

Originally `ant` used `contextualize` to set the class loaders but the root module didn't support that method either. So the choice was to add the `contextualize` method via also adding the interface `Contextualizable` or just add the setter. I figured setter would be better as the interface would require all root modules to implement a complex method like `contextualize`. `Main` also used the setter methods instead of `contextualize`.  Added a `reset` method to `TestRootModuleChecker` to ensure it is false before any testing since the field is static.","closed","","rnveach","2017-01-23T21:20:01Z","2017-01-28T22:54:16Z"

Now it tracks package name (for direct class imports) and therefore also excludes all `java.lang` classes. Unfortunately, it does not support wildcard imports, like `import java.lang.*`, because I don't know how to track them.  I've looked though all diff reports and for each project the metric value either decreases (because of direct imports from `java.lang`) or remains the same.  Diff: https://soon-checkstyle-diffs.github.io/issue-3309/index.html  Now I'm going to run some performance tests. For now the module uses plain `startsWith`, but we should probably use trie or similar structure to check if the package is excluded.   This PR is still in work, but I want to receive some feedback.

It isn't specifically written out in the code and some people may not understand that there is an implied `return` statement there.

[Reasoning why needed.](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3105#issuecomment-210875289) CS reported violation indent = `indent` + `ioffset`. **Note:** Some places where we use this with a large value may have to be inspected as possible issues.

Added suppression for *Test files as we do not need to add javadoc for UTs or make them final.  3) Question: should we check whether a method has @Override annotation? For example, if a method has @Override annotation, the Check will not rise violation. Rationale: method which is designed for extension has to have javadoc commend and class which extends the base class and overrides the method also inherits javadoc. And  if a method does not have @Override annotation, the Check will rise violation. In Checkstyle we have a lot of such cases, where there is @Override on public method, for example, check CIs violations.

"","3512","Issue #2427: added customizable javadoc tokens","Issue #2427.  Added acceptable and required javadoc tokens. Code was mostly copied from `TreeWalker` which this class is mimicking. All javadoc checks required `getRequiredJavadocTokens` to be added.  Questions: 1) The issue made note of an [area that had documentation on this already but was removed](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/fff24e89001ce2ad9c30d1f573639cd640183669/src/xdocs/config_javadoc.xml#L978). Was that documentation valid that the 2 tokens are optional? Are there any other optional tokens for the javadoc checks? I didn't see anything jump out when glancing over.  Some things to note: 1) We needed some place to validate that the javadoc tokens set for the check are correct and require us to be able to throw a `CheckstyleException`. I did this in `init` and so had to add the exception to the throws clause, and this is why there is an update in `FallThroughCheck`. I don't see any other place we can do this. I brought this up before where [none of the `AbstractCheck` methods allow throwing an exception](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/25a37e5049b7816b34c552899841a978efc37a63/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AbstractCheck.java#L126-L169), even `CheckstyleException` and I don't think we should use runtime exceptions. If your ok with it, I think we should change all the methods to be able to throw `CheckstyleException`s.  2) Javadoc's `walk` method changed slightly because I think there is a bug with `waitsForProcessing` and when we loop `while (curNode != null && toVisit == null) {` more than once since the value isn't updated. I will try to find a test to show this and add it.  3) `AtClauseOrderCheck` changed slightly to not loop through the children, but to use the visit token's power. This would be helpful if the token appears in other places than a child of the root.","closed","","rnveach","2016-10-23T23:42:20Z","2016-11-01T20:07:05Z"

What I'm trying to do is suppress warnings for a specific check _and_ with a specific message.  The implementation of Tag.isMatch() in SuppressWithNearbyCommentFilter seems to indicate that I can only do one or the other.  That is to say, I'd prefer if checkFormat and messageFormat are both set on the module, both must match.  Leaving checkFormat off defaults to a regex of "".*"" and so messageFormat is not respected.  I needed to set checkFormat to a pattern that will never match a check name for messageFormat to get used.  (This took me a couple hours of frustruction to figure out.)  For example, I would like to suppress a shared ImportControl check, but only when the message relates to com.sun.javadoc.  The other imports that are prohibited should still be enforced.  ``` xml                                                                 ```  All my files start with ""some comment text"" in the header, so this should disable import warnings for com.sun.javadoc in this one project.  However, the code for isMatch from SuppressWithNearbyCommentFilter below matches (filters) an event if only the check name matches (tagCheckRegexp).  I believe the ""else if"" should actually be moved up.  ``` java     public boolean isMatch(AuditEvent event)     {         int line = event.getLine();         boolean match = false;         if ((line >= this.firstLine) && (line = this.firstLine) && (line","open","","eric-milles","2016-08-12T21:16:20Z","2016-12-14T18:16:54Z"

Having this check would allow for a more precise definition of the naming conventions. Currently, lambda arguments must follow the same naming convention as method arguments.

In our project (Android OS) we [use ENTITY in our config](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/checkstyle/+/master/android-style.xml) to allow composing our config files from many different files as some subprojects of Android OS have different style requirements. This normally works great with Checkstyle, however our default `java` installation has `load-external-dtd` feature disabled (due to security reasons). This is a request to add ` final SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance(); factory.setFeature(""http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd"", true);`  to `com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.AbstractLoader`.  This would not affect anyone, except to allow us to keep using Checkstyle without any downstream modifications.   both features load-external-dtd and external-general-entities are normally default set to true. Our company has set their java defaults to false as it can lead to cross scripting attacks if not handled correctly. load-external-dtd feature allows to load external DTD into a an XML document and external-general-entities feature allows to these these external DTDs in elements. Using these two we are able to compose configuration files from multiple XML files.

"","3016","Support calculating and reporting metric-like values, not just checking against threshold","I am working on a Learning Analytics plugin for Eclipse, that collects and visualises data about coding activities, like line count, test success and failure, use of debugging tools etc. Some of the data is shown in a plot, so you can see how things change over time, and the idea is identify trends and signs of good (or bad) coding habits, breakdowns etc. Checkstyle provides interesting feedback about characteristics of code that affect quality, that would be useful to collect in the same manner. However, checkstyle only gives feedback when a characteristic is within/outside certain limits, and does not report the value(s) themselves, other than in the text message when a rule is violated.  I propose to introduce means for calculating and reporting values within a Check, instead of just logging issues, so that listeners or other tools can provide other kinds of feedback, like plot complexity over time and compare with a benchmark (pre-made solution). It needn't be very complex and can be limited to simple values. E.g. a Check could implement a generic interface MeasureCheck with a method T getMeasure() that could be called to collect these measures for all classes and methods in project. Alternatively, AbstractCheck could add a logMeasure method that a Check can use to report interesting values during an audit, related to classes and methods. It should be possible for listeners or other objects to retrieve these values afterwards.","closed","","hallvard","2016-03-08T12:56:15Z","2016-03-08T13:18:05Z"

"","3792","Can't override `-t` option for custom tree modules","I am planning to start looking into making new custom trees in another project. It would be very helpful if Checkstyle's CLI allowed printing those module's trees. Right now `TreeWalker` has a monopoly on the `-t`/`-T` options. Those options go directly to `TreeWalker` and there is no way to override the default for custom modules with their own trees. Viewing trees is very helpful when debugging the tree and making new modules for that tree. The only current way to do this without the CLI is to make print module.  I would like an option to override the default tree module and be able to select a different one. This is the current CLI example I am thinking of now: `-t -m MyCustomTreeModule`. Just like the configuration, it would work if the class is defined in the packages XML or if I specify the full classpath.  To make this more seamless, we might want to consider moving Checkstyle's tree specific code from `AstTreeStringPrinter` to the actual tree class (`TreeWalker` and `AbstractJavadocCheck`) and have `AstTreeStringPrinter` be a full utility class that any class can use for their own trees. Also make an API interface defining these special modules as AST Tree modules that support methods like `parse` and `print`.","closed","","rnveach","2017-02-02T21:36:24Z","2017-10-28T23:03:37Z"

"","3709","Should we use Semantic Versioning in release numbers","http://semver.org format must be ""X.Y.Z"", some tools warn about this - https://www.versioneye.com/java/com.puppycrawl.tools:checkstyle/7.4  so, do we need to switch to that version format ?  Benefits:  - follow the standard user can clearly see backward-incomptible fixes  Inconveniences and nuances: - does not work well with [time-based releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often), we can not make all ""planned"" updates in one iteration, so we will trigger increment of major version too often to my mind. I even think to use continuous releases, but it also have problem with semantic versions - [1](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/12/10/semantic-versioning-with-continuous-deployment/), [2](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/semantic-versioning-folly)  - extra 0 at the end of release - we do not completely follow ""backwards-compatible"" in common sense, we introduce NOT backwards-compatible changes in minor release. We do this as too much in checkstyle is exposed to user. - maven release plugin will automatically update version to X.Y.Z+1. So for 7.4.0 it will do 7.4.1 , so we will need to be caution during release.  > Why we use time-based releases ?  Maintainers team is tiny. Non of maintainers focused on project full hours and do progress base on their free time. So big updates are impossible to accomplish in one release. There are many occasional contributors that provide fixes to bugs. All this contributors need is to pass acceptance of fix and start to use result as soon as possible (the only incentive to contribute). So delay in release will discourage contributors - not acceptable. I selected 1 month period , only because release process is time consuming and I do not want to spend my time on releases only. This period is easy to remember for me. In short: why we are small team that do maintenance during free time (unpredictable time) so we should appreciate contribution from aside, so release often, tom time-based.  > What is api changes for Checkstyle ?  Checkstyle has api package for projects that want to embed it (plugins, ....). Checkstyle exposing configuration file there all properties and modules are mentioned. We have huge problems in API classes and maintaining badly designed modules and their properties. Change in API affect other projects that use us, checkstyle in modules affect all our users. So all modules and module's properties are critical point in backward compatibility. During last 3 years, we did a brake in 17 releases. Some modules are still so badly designed so we will continue that brake way for sure (still too much to break). API is slightly changed during this time.  > What does checkstyle numbers mean now ?      it is partly semantic. Major version is major milestone - so all ""planned"" fixes will eventually appear in it. I usually bind it to API classes major refactoring, big features introduction, runtime jdk change. Minor version is minor milestones and minor breaking compatibilities - I consider changes on breaking changes in modules as minor break. I bump minor if new functionality is appear. Patch version - is purely semantic patch version, completely compatible, no new functionality.","closed","","romani","2017-01-10T19:32:27Z","2021-05-02T16:38:30Z"

It speeds up checkstyle's run by not rechecking files that have no issues and have not changed.

I feel this will help developers who have to constantly re-run the checkstyle before sending a PR to the server.

"","3169","OSGi bundle of Checkstyle","How about distributing the Checkstyle JAR as a valid OSGi bundle, with a full MANIFEST?  Either the existing ""fat JAR"" one as-is, or a smaller one which has only Checkstyle itself, and does not include ANTLR and Google Guava and Apache Commons \* ?  My understanding is that http://bnd.bndtools.org through http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html (also documented on http://bnd.bndtools.org/tools/felix-maven.html), or https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/maven/bnd-maven-plugin/README.md, could do this.  The advantage of doing this would be that e.g. the Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in project then should be able to, somehow, consume the Checkstyle JAR as-is, without re-wrapping it as it currently does, with an OSGi MANIFEST.MF there (see https://sourceforge.net/p/eclipse-cs/git/ci/master/tree/net.sf.eclipsecs.checkstyle/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF). The problem with the current approach is that that MANIFEST lacks versioning for the embedded JARs, and exposes too much, see also https://sourceforge.net/p/eclipse-cs/bugs/403/. In an ideal world, it would thus be better if Checkstyle core (this project) would make itself available as a valid OSGi bundle. Note that actually at least Google Guava, and probably Apache Commons also (not checked), already have valid OSGi MANIFEST.MF in their bundles. BND could read and merge them into a better MANIFEST.MF for Checkstyle, even if it's a fat JAR.  Please let me know if you would consider this, if a Pull Request for it was made.

"","3174","New Check: AvoidReassigningParameters check, almost opposite of FinalParameters (like PMD's)","How about a new check which would see that any non-final parameters are not re-assigned within a method?  PMD already has this, and it's called AvoidReassigningParameters there. (Of course one could also just use PMD in addition to Checkstyle on a project...)  Basically just like what does javac when you use the 'final' keyword. Some people seem to think, and I would have to agree, that putting the 'final' keyword in every argument of every method everywhere hurts readability. It doesn't actually change the compiled byte code in any way. So not writing ""final"", unless it's exceptionally required for anonymous inner classes (or lambda/closures), yet have non-final parameter re-assignment detected by a code quality tool such as Checkstyle (or PMD), seems like a good idea.  In a sense this would be the ""opposite"" of current Checkstyle's [FinalParameters](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#FinalParameters), and if this is implemented then the FinalParameters documentation should probably link to the new AvoidReassigningParameters check.   If this is made available, then to help clean up existing code, it would also be interesting to have the opposite kind of Check, to detect if final is used when it's not required, so any final arguments which are NOT passed to an anonymous inner classes (or lambda/closures). I don't know if PMD can do that?  BTW: It's interesting to [note Checkstyle's own checkstyle configuration in this regard](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/4c42b6abbe468576af41bf559d09cb0b5a8f2131/config/checkstyle_checks.xml#L315) BTW.. ;-)  ##","open","new module,","vorburger","2016-05-13T15:00:51Z","2016-12-14T18:16:42Z"

Firstly, thank you for all your efforts over the years with Checkstyle -- I've gotten a lot of use out of it, both personally and at work :)  Secondly, I'd like to report what looks like a bug. When upgrading from Checkstyle 5.6 to 6.16.1, I noticed a bunch of new ParenPad warnings. They were triggered by things like this: ``` E:\Users\Wade\Downloads\Checkstyle bug report>javac Test.java  E:\Users\Wade\Downloads\Checkstyle bug report>cat Test.java package test;  public class Test {     static void main( String [] args ) {         String s = ""test"";         Object o = s;         ((String)o).length();     } } E:\Users\Wade\Downloads\Checkstyle bug report>cat config.xml                                                              E:\Users\Wade\Downloads\Checkstyle bug report>java -jar checkstyle-6.17-all.jar -c config.xml Test.java Starting audit...

[ParenPad] [WARN] E:\Users\Wade\Downloads\Checkstyle bug report\Test.java:7:19: ')' is not preceded with whitespace. [ParenPad] Audit done.  ``` Here's the additional data you wanted. The expected output is no warnings. The actual output incorrectly shows the parens around ""(String)o"" to be a METHOD_CALL.  It seems like Checkstyle now thinks the parens around (Wavefront)oElement are a method call instead of just an expression. If I remove METHOD_CALL from the ParenPad configuration, the warning goes away. Or if I put spaces inside like this `( (Wavefront)oElement ).getType() ` the warning also goes away. Sorry, but I don't know exactly which version of Checkstyle this change occurred in, since I hadn't upgraded for a while.

"","3212","Modules and XDocs: changed setter methods to recieve similar types with field type for easier xdoc validation","From Issue #3187   Affected modules/checks: SuppressWarningsHolder , AtclauseOrderCheck, SingleLineJavadocCheck  To create a JUnit for module's default types we need to know the type we are dealing with to display it correctly. Unfortunately, We use `String` in the setter for everything, from regular expressions, file locations, to custom enumerations. It might be better if we could align the setter type to the bean's type, using https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/20506e1ceb2de74c9a85367135be714f8208643f/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AutomaticBean.java#L65.  So we will change bean methods from:  ``` void setProperty(String s) {     field = s.split("",""); } ```  into:  ``` void setProperty(String... s) {     field = s; } ```  This may break compatibility in areas where original methods weren't code correctly for all weird issues, like https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/3250#issue-158782661 where the setter method wasn't trimming spaces from comma delimited input.","closed","breaking compatibility,","rnveach","2016-05-22T22:08:35Z","2016-06-07T13:12:28Z"

"","3312","Ant: accept path in addition to fileset option","Created: 2009-03-30 Creator: Oliver Burn  We just started using checkstyle in our Java 6 codebase with Ant. It seems that Ant is going through a mild revolution in terms of Resource Collections in its data types, which is a good thing.  I bring this up because the checkstyle ant task only takes a single file or a fileset as input. The problem is that I have my source files in several directories that are defined as a path, a sourcepath that is used with many tasks including javac, javadoc, etc. Unfortunately Ant doesn’t make it easy to convert from a path to a fileset(http://stackoverflow.com/a/1700641/1015848), and the ant-contrib task of pathtofileset doesn’t actually make a fileset of the files in the path, just of the paths themselves. If I do this and pass the new fileset to the checkstyle ant task it doesn’t find any java files.  When I discussed this on the ant mailing list, it was suggested that checkstyle support paths as well as filesets for specifying source files. http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ant-user/200903.mbox/%3c49CBFEA9.4040109@gmx.de%3e  I had a quick look at doing this in the checkstyle task. With the assumption that a provided path specifies a number of root directories that are expanded into source trees, doesn’t seem too difficult. To handle all resource types appears to be quite a bit more effort at first glance but still not complex.  Read: ""fileset"" type - https://ant.apache.org/manual/tutorial-tasks-filesets-properties.html#filesets , java type ""FileSet"" ""path"" type - https://ant.apache.org/manual/tutorial-tasks-filesets-properties.html#path, java type ""Path""  Right now we have `public void addFileset(FileSet fileSet) {` - https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/ant/CheckstyleAntTask.java#L158 it is required to create new property `public void addPath(Path path) {`","closed","medium,","romani","2016-06-26T05:17:03Z","2017-04-29T17:41:30Z"

But it does not check the other way round, that if hashCode is overridden also equals is overridden.  Strictly speaking, this is harmless most times, but usually it indicates that the programmer did make an error. Most programming rules I know strongly associate both methods - either overload none or both. E.g. http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/javaCodingStd.html#secRec >If you override Object.equals, also override Object.hashCode, and vice-versa. Rationale: Essentially all containers and other utilities that group or compare objects in ways depending on equality rely on hashcodes to indicate possible equality.  I thought there was also a test that if equals is overridden it has the right signature, but I do not find it right now (this sentence could be a feature request).  ``` /var/tmp $ cat TestClass.java  public class InputEqualsHashCode {     public int hashCode() {         return 1;     }  } /var/tmp $ cat my_check.xml                               /var/tmp $ java -jar checkstyle-7.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -c my_check.xml TestClass.java  Starting audit...

Especially when writing Swing GUI code, you easily surpass the default data abstraction coupling and class fan out values, although these values definately make a lot of sense for regular classes. E.g. a regualar main window uses GUI components JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, JMenuBar, JMenu, JMenuItem, JFileChooser, event handling classes like ActionListener, WindowListener, MouseListener, models like Document, ButtonGroup, and the standard classes String, File etc. and there is just no way around it ( except from breaking this into multiple classes, but this usually does not make sense ) ``` ##","closed","medium,","romani","2016-06-25T04:31:32Z","2017-04-10T13:55:28Z"

In addition, Maven does not set user language and country properly when it executes UTs with the following set of commands taken from Travis CI matrix:  ``` mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=de -Duser.country=DE' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=es -Duser.country=ES' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=fi -Duser.country=FI' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=fr -Duser.country=FR' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=zh -Duser.country=CN' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=ja -Duser.country=JP' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=pt -Duser.country=PT' mvn clean integration-test failsafe:verify -DargLine='-Duser.language=tr -Duser.country=TR' ```  BaseCheckTestSupport has [getCheckMessage](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/BaseCheckTestSupport.java#L265) method which loads message resources as stream, but not as resource bundle. It means that UTs have to fail in German or other locale as we always load the messages.properties without language and country variants, but they do not.  The problem may happen due to the fact that some system properties (as `user.language` and `user.country`) must be set on the command line of the JVM, and cannot be set after the JVM has been started.   maven-surefire-plugin has [special VM properties](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/system-properties.html) which are intended to deal with the Maven's problem.

"","3551","CustomImportOrder should check that import groups are separated by one line only","Based on the discussion at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/3519, CustomImportOrder check should validate the exact number of blank lines between groups if separateLineBetweenGroups option is set to true.   Google Style Guide ([section 3.3.3](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s3.3.3-import-ordering-and-spacing)) says that If there are both static and non-static imports, a single blank line separates the two blocks. There are no other blank lines between import statements. In addition, code formatters in popular IDEs remove double blank lines betwen groups (see discussion at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/2143). Thus, lets restrict the number of blank lines between import groups to one.   The current implementation of CustomImportOrder allows to have more than one blank line between import groups and this leads to inability of covering the new Google Style Guide (section 3.3.3) rule with the check.

Checkstyle ends with 2 errors. ```  From my point of view the behaviour (Checkstyle 7.0) is correct since '}' on line 7 is not alone on the line. What is more, as it was requested at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3090 there should not be violation in the following example:  Input:   ``` java public class DoWhile {     public static void main(String[] args) {         do {         } while (true);     } } ```  Configuration:  ``` xml                                  ```  However, if there is a false positive in Checkstyle 7.0, it will mean that both options (SAME and ALONE) should work equally for do-while loops which certainly is incorrect.  Finally, some users prefer to place '}' on the same line as literal WHILE in do-while loops, even if brace policy is ALONE, but RightCurlyCheck (Checkstyle 7.0) will throw violation. To avoid the violation they have to exclude LITERAL_DO from tokens set.   Let's investigate the following example: Input:  ``` java public class DoWhile {     public static void main(String[] args) {         do {             int a = 5;         } while (true);     } } ```  Tree structure:  ``` CLASS_DEF -> CLASS_DEF [1:0] |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [1:0] |  `--LITERAL_PUBLIC -> public [1:0] |--LITERAL_CLASS -> class [1:7] |--IDENT -> DoWhile [1:13] `--OBJBLOCK -> OBJBLOCK [1:21]     |--LCURLY -> { [1:21]     |--METHOD_DEF -> METHOD_DEF [2:4]     |  |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [2:4]     |  |  |--LITERAL_PUBLIC -> public [2:4]     |  |  `--LITERAL_STATIC -> static [2:11]     |  |--TYPE -> TYPE [2:18]     |  |  `--LITERAL_VOID -> void [2:18]     |  |--IDENT -> main [2:23]     |  |--LPAREN -> ( [2:27]     |  |--PARAMETERS -> PARAMETERS [2:34]     |  |  `--PARAMETER_DEF -> PARAMETER_DEF [2:34]     |  |      |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [2:34]     |  |      |--TYPE -> TYPE [2:34]     |  |      |  `--ARRAY_DECLARATOR -> [ [2:34]     |  |      |      |--IDENT -> String [2:28]     |  |      |      `--RBRACK -> ] [2:35]     |  |      `--IDENT -> args [2:37]     |  |--RPAREN -> ) [2:41]     |  `--SLIST -> { [2:43]     |      |--LITERAL_DO -> do [3:8]     |      |  |--SLIST -> { [3:11]     |      |  |  |--VARIABLE_DEF -> VARIABLE_DEF [4:11]     |      |  |  |  |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [4:11]     |      |  |  |  |--TYPE -> TYPE [4:11]     |      |  |  |  |  `--LITERAL_INT -> int [4:11]     |      |  |  |  |--IDENT -> a [4:15]     |      |  |  |  `--ASSIGN -> = [4:17]     |      |  |  |      `--EXPR -> EXPR [4:19]     |      |  |  |          `--NUM_INT -> 5 [4:19]     |      |  |  |--SEMI -> ; [4:20]     |      |  |  `--RCURLY -> } [5:8]     |      |  |--DO_WHILE -> while [5:10]     |      |  |--LPAREN -> ( [5:16]     |      |  |--EXPR -> EXPR [5:17]     |      |  |  `--LITERAL_TRUE -> true [5:17]     |      |  |--RPAREN -> ) [5:21]     |      |  `--SEMI -> ; [5:22]     |      `--RCURLY -> } [6:4]     `--RCURLY -> } [7:0] ```  When we begin treating do-while loop: 1) RightCurlyCheck receives LITERAL_DO. 2) We get right curly brace, which is a last child of LITERAL_DO. 3) We get left curly brace which is SLIST token. 4) We get token which follows left curly brace (next token for right curly brace) which is DO_WHILE literal. 5) Then if brace policy is ALONE we check whether left curly brace which closes do-while block is on the same line as next token (DO_WHILE). If yes, we rise violation.  I do not see a problem in the logic.","closed","","MEZk","2016-06-28T06:26:05Z","2016-06-28T12:50:39Z"

How about implementing a second parameter `illegalClasses` (default: `null`):  ``` xml             ```  Furthermore we could add a third parameter `regexp` (default: `false`) that determines whether the comma separated package or class names should be interpreted as regular expressions:  ``` xml                  ```  Both would support the mentioned case without interfering with the current behavior. 1. Users might want to use more than one `ImportControl` check with varying severity. This would be much less straight forward using the `ImportControlCheck`, simply because it would require multiple `import_control.xml` files. 2. Users might just want to globally forbid certain classes (such as old [FindBugs annotations](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/api/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/annotations/package-summary.html), where some annotations in the same package are still valid). In cases like this, defining an `import_control.xml` file seems like overkill to me, when the same could be achieved with just these two additional parameters. ##","closed","medium,","romani","2016-09-19T19:32:10Z","2022-01-10T01:55:15Z"

Details at: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html  Proposal is to add   maxNestingSingleLineStatement (see proposal at [comment](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/1007#issuecomment-120601784)) to work with `allowSingleLineStatement` to let user define depth.  After conversations in issues ,now looks like problem is not only in nesting depth but in location of ""trailing sub statements"".  Looks at [spec](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.5) , ""StatementWithoutTrailingSubstatement"". So we might need new option ""allowSameLineTrailingSubstatement""  To to avoid conflict of interest and ..... User should define himself allowed depth of single line statement. User could define nesting level (`maxNestingSingleLineStatement`) to satisfy code that they like or use `allowSameLineTrailingSubstatement`.

That is, when wrapped we want to see:  ``` java String[] strings = {   ""one"",   ""two"",   ""three"", };  and  Arrays.asList(new String[] {   ""one"",   ""two"",   ""three"", }); ```  _I know Arrays.asList is variadic, but I wanted a familiar example to show passing an inline array._ ##","open","","romani","2016-09-03T13:39:08Z","2020-04-22T14:38:41Z"

After checking out the code, it seems checkstyle does not cache those files because they have violations. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/4b7adec5ae396e24d3d0bf0d790919a45bac5421/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Checker.java#L269  Checkstyle has no violations being printed during its run. All the violations that are preventing files from being cached are all suppressed inside `fireErrors`. Since suppressions are part of the external resources, we can add these files to the cache without having to worry about a disconnect between cache and non-cached runs. When the external resource is changed, the entire cache file is invalidated. We should only be skipping placing files in the cache if they print non-suppressedd violations.  The issue can be seen if you run the ant-phase-verify multiple times without changing anything and having the cache on. The second run should finish instantly since no files have changed and there are no violations.  this issue depends on #3489.  ------------------------- Want to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/38036924-checker-cache-not-saving-files-with-suppressions?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F500528&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F500528&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).","closed","approved,","rnveach","2016-10-02T01:09:10Z","2016-11-10T22:09:14Z"

That would be great for situations where a method naturally is very big, like data mapping methods, or, in my case, I have a (legacy) method called `getMetaInformation()` where I collect fields and relations for UI presentation. This method occurs in some hundreds of files, and I don't want to refactor each of it. In those cases, the `MethodLength` rule should ignore the method length of methods according to a given pattern or list.  I.e. there should be a new option for the `MethodLength` module configuration like:  `` `` `` `` ``  Instead of an ignorePattern, it could be also i.e. a comma-separated list of methodNames: `` `` `` ##","closed","discussion ongoing,","Xsasan","2016-07-28T12:37:23Z","2016-12-10T22:01:46Z"

In the example, there are no violations that variables a and b should be closer to the block that uses them. They are not very close to the block at all, and are not declared `final`. I am expecting them to put out violations since they are so far away, just like if the for loop didn't exist. On the [XDoc](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_coding.html#VariableDeclarationUsageDistance) in the `Notes` section, I understand from case 1 that the check will not require me to put variables inside the block. I am just asking that the variables be placed close enough to the block to satisfy the distance, assuming the block in question is considered 1 unit as a whole.  From the example above, I am expecting the following violations: ``` [ERROR] TestClass.java:3: Distance between variable 'a' declaration and its first usage is 13, but allowed 1.  Consider to make that variable as final if you still need to store its value in advance (before method calls that might do side effect on original value).

Consider to make that variable as final if you still need to store its value in advance (before method calls that might do side effect on original value).

Even though the last case isn't falling into another case statement, I consider the reason for ""FallThrough"" is to make sure **every case** ends with some type of exit (return, throw, break, etc) so when you add a new case anywhere (top, bottom, above another case), you aren't adding the possibility of a fall through bug. That example shows that the last case doesn't follow that strictly. If a coder just added a new case onto the end of the switch in the example, it would then create a fall through and get reported then.

"","3367","Implementation of Builder pattern for DetectorOptions is not thread-safe and mutable","@romani  I remember discussing with you the idea that Checkstyle might be run in multi-thread mode in future. Thus, we should take into account that:  1) the current implementation of Builder pattern for DetectorOptions is not thread-safe, because 'DetectorOptions's fields are not final and can be changed by two different threads.  2) 'build' method returns the same object between invocations, and if the class API user continues setting or changing field's values, the fields of the builder object, which is already created, will be changed.  The solution to the first problem is to implement [classic Builder pattern](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074938/core-java/too-many-parameters-in-java-methods-part-3-builder-pattern.html) for reducing the number of arguments.  The simple solution to the second problem can be the same as implemented by @Vladlis in [CliOptions](https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/blob/master/releasenotes-xdoc-builder/src/main/java/com/github/checkstyle/CliOptions.java#L200), however, it is [mutable](https://github.com/checkstyle/contribution/blob/master/releasenotes-builder/src/main/java/com/github/checkstyle/CliOptions.java#L32) and not thread-safe. That is why we should use classic Builder implementation, but in this case there will be problems with lazy initialization of regexp Pattern object as all  DetectorOptions fields will become final and have to be initialized in constructor. Maybe field 'pattern' should be excluded from class fields and become a local variable of getter. ##","open","","MEZk","2016-07-24T16:58:57Z","2016-12-14T18:17:19Z"

Given that forceStrictCondition is false and lineWrappingIndentation = 0, I should be able to indent lambda expressions on wrapping lines at any indent level > 0.   In First example, the String arg on line 14 is aligned and passes indentation rule (indention of 26) but the Consumer and Supplier args on line 13 and 15 are forced to indent at 8 or 12.  In second example, I define my Function on a new line after assignment operator (lines 25-33). This is indented by Intellij to 16 as it respects current line wrapping settings. But checkstyle want an indentation of 8 for wrapping line and all subsequent lines of lambda expression. ##","closed","has bounty,","aruberto","2016-07-09T20:25:34Z","2020-09-26T17:41:58Z"

Checkstyle ends with 3 errors. ```  ---------------  If the `validateEnhancedForLoopVariable` property of the `FinalLocalVariable` module is set to `false` (which is the default), then the first error (line 10) is not reported. It is reasonable because the enhanced for-loop variable is implicitly `final`.  I'd like a similar `Boolean` property, possibly called `validateMultiCatchVariable`, with also a default value of `false`, which would avoid the third error (line 15) being reported. The reasoning for this is that multi-catch variables [are implicitly `final`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.20), and having to explicitly declare that in order to use the module is redundant, as well as space-consuming. From specification: `An exception parameter of a multi-catch clause is implicitly declared final if it is not explicitly declared final. `  The second error (line 13) must still be reported regardless of the value of the new property, because that variable is not implicitly `final`.  --- Want to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/39798784-option-for-finallocalvariable-not-to-check-multi-catch-variables?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F500528&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F500528&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).","closed","approved,","Kiena","2016-12-06T23:01:44Z","2016-12-31T05:01:11Z"

The issue I am observing is that Checkstyle produces different results when the same file is analyzed by different Checker instances within the same JVM. The checker instances run in sequence one after another in the same thread, so it cannot be a multithreading issue.   The test class [`IdenticalResultsTest`](https://github.com/thombergs/checkstyle-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/org/wickedsource/checkstyle/playground/IdenticalResultsTest.java) in the test setup creates two Checker instances and configures them with the same config and runs them on the same file.

The problem is that Checkstyle checks that imports are in alphabetical order, which is correct. But '*' is before [a-z], that is why Checkstyle expects the following import order:  ``` import data.*; import data.Class; ```  but Intellij Idea puts puts \* after more specific classes:  ``` import data.Class; import data.*; ```  which makes sense, because developers would like to see specific classes before *  Expected implementation: allow such order by default (if it doesn't conflict with other IDE) or add a configuration attribute to allow such ordering  P.S.: Why the hell we should import data.Class when we already imported data.*? It's because java.lang.* (and java.lang.Class) imported implicitly. If we don't import data.Class then compiler assumes that we refer to java.lang.Class. And we cannot rename the class ""Class"" because it's in external library ##","closed","","ychulovskyy","2016-08-05T08:27:53Z","2019-03-03T07:06:47Z"

In our example, `root.foo` is defined before `root.foobar` so it is tested first and `Baz`'s package `root.foobar` does start with `root.foo`, thus `foo`'s authorizations are used instead. ##","closed","","ncorai","2016-08-09T00:18:02Z","2017-01-05T17:17:06Z"

"","3049","Adding autofix support","(Apologies if this has been discussed already or is being tracked elsewhere--I couldn't find it in a few minutes of searching.)  [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org/) provides an API for autofixing simple lint issues by providing an original and replacement string, in addition to the line and column number. This can be super useful for fixing tedious issues and, in extreme cases, can even allow you to bypass a second lint check despite some initial failures.  (As an example: [here](http://eslint.org/blog/2015/09/eslint-v1.5.0-released) are some of the rules that ESLint can autofix.)  I'm curious if there has even been any discussion of supporting autofix in Checkstyle (i.e., in the output XML, using an error level of `autofix` and providing said original and replacement text, so that this information can be passed to the Phabricator API).  In a recent hackathon, I was able to fork Checkstyle and add reliable autofix for a number of rules (`FinalParameterCheck`, `FinalLocalVariableCheck`, `WhitespaceAroundCheck`, `UnusedImportCheck` etc.) as a proof-of-concept. Of course, not every rule is autofixable, though there do seem to be some other viable candidates (`ArrayTrailingCommaCheck`, `NewlineAtEndOfFileCheck`, `ModifierOrderCheck`, etc.).

We want lambdas, array inits, and anon. inner classes to use the tighter style of brace at the end of the line.  AST for anon. inner is currently like this: ![checkstyle ast of anon inner class](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18193802/16422934/be65b10e-3d1f-11e6-8ad0-f54d0e35cb8a.png)","closed","","eric-milles","2016-06-28T16:06:28Z","2022-07-28T09:43:32Z"

Suggestions:  ``` java public List getExternalResources() {     return Collections.EMPTY_LIST; } ```  or  ``` java public OptionalgetExternalResources() {     return Optional.absence(); } ```  Both first and second implementation require null check in Checker, because we do not know whether user will follow the rule and return non null reference.  4) How can we be sure that user will invoke 'super.getExternalResources' , for example, in HeaderCheck and will give information about the header file (from AbstractHeaderCheck) in Checker?","closed","","MEZk","2016-04-11T18:47:22Z","2016-05-16T20:54:15Z"

In most cases, UT is in the same package as the related check class, so we can just get the package by the test class itself. In other cases, they are in different packages, so we need to pass an extra class parameter as well.  This fix is to remove the ROOT locale in tests, and that's done.

If we get rid of ImmutableList and ImmutableSet it will require to use Collections.copy and then create unmodifiable list or set view based on mutable copy. I don't think it is reasonable.  5) If we get rid of `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSortedSet` the code will become too big. For example:  ``` java private static final Set SINGLE_TAGS = ImmutableSortedSet.of(         ""br"", ""li"", ""dt"", ""dd"", ""hr"", ""img"", ""p"", ""td"", ""tr"", ""th""); ```  will become  ``` java private static final Set SINGLE_TAGS = Collections.unmodifiableSortedSet(Stream.of(     ""br"", ""li"", ""dt"", ""dd"", ""hr"", ""img"", ""p"", ""td"", ""tr"", ""th"")     .collect(Collectors.toCollection(TreeSet::new))); ```  6) `com.google.common.collect.Maps` has 'difference' method which is a simple way to get the difference between two maps. It will decrease readibility if we try to get rid of the dependency.  I think that is all we can do now.","closed","","MEZk","2016-09-20T14:49:14Z","2016-09-21T02:52:06Z"

It is no use gathering additional information on final variable candidates such as 'assignOutsideConditionalBlock', 'assignInIfBlock', 'assignInIfBlockWhichIsInsideCaseBlock'. All we need is to follow the rule that is used by compiler and determine variables that are already assigned. Of course there are special treatments of some blocks (else, switch).  As you can see from the report there are 112 differences. The analysis was really hard for me and I decided to simplify and add them all as test cases (structure of blocks is saved), then check them in compile time (except for duplicates). I noticed that they are false positives.  P.S Should be merged after https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/3361.","closed","","MEZk","2016-07-22T18:01:01Z","2016-07-23T05:09:30Z"

"","3202","Allow WhitespaceAround for ARRAY_INIT token","# Using this configuration:  ``` xml                        ```  Checkstyle won't report on the curly braces used for array declarations, such as:  ``` java public class Foo {     public final int[] COLORS = new int[]{Color.BLACK };     //                                   ^ doesn't report missing whitespace around { } ```  ``` bash $ java -jar ~/Downloads/checkstyle-6.18/checkstyle-6.18-all.jar -c config.xml Foo.java Starting audit... Audit done. ```  This is down to the fact that even though `WhitespaceAround` appllies to `LCURLY` and `RCURLY` tokens, when writing an array, the `{` is actually treated as an `ARRAY_INIT` token, which is not currently being processed by the check at all (even is not allowed Token).  It would be desired if `ARRAY_INIT` was to be processed by `WhitespaceAround` in order to allow valiadation of code above, and have the configuration(given before) violation on arrays' initialization.","closed","new feature,","jsotuyod","2016-05-20T15:39:46Z","2016-12-12T21:16:17Z"
