Furthermore,It seems that unit test miss the test of some property value = 'false'. Because I also find [Issue #5090](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/5090) with same problem.  Attention: sorting for imports should not affect sorting for statics, they are two different options and should work independently.  sortStaticImportsAlphabetically was added at #12 with reason: > When you specify package groupings inside ImportOrder, that same ordering is applied to the single group of static imports. Eclipse's Organize Imports feature, however, sorts all static imports alphabetically within a single group--ignoring the package grouping order. There's no way to synchronize the behavior between the two tools  So sorting/grouping of imports should not affect static imports.","open","approved,","djydewang","2017-11-09T03:38:10Z","2017-11-11T14:22:06Z"

For all packages, we have [a list of banned imports of `java.io.File*Stream`, `java.util.stream.*`, and `java.util.Comparator`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/config/import-control.xml#L8-L24). However, the `gui` sub-package with it's own isolated list of imports, allows `java.io` and allows `java.util.*` (with no sub-subpackages).  This means `gui` allows some imports that are banned on a global level. We have a global ban because these imports cause issues with some tools or there are better ways to code that may not be obvious. [Because sub-packages are examined first](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/xdocs/config_imports.xml#L892-L894), the only current way to correct this is to ban imports in 2 places, duplicating the list and reasoning.  Should we consider to create a new area that will be a global blacklist to ban imports everywhere and ignore other rules? Or maybe split the import control into 2, a global blacklist and a package by package whitelist?","open","","rnveach","2018-04-14T13:05:43Z","2018-04-18T15:25:35Z"

"","5756","RedundantModifier should allow redundant modifiers in interfaces","This is a request for a new check or a variation of `RedundantModifier`.  In Java 8, developers are allowed to have static and default methods on interfaces. In Java 9, developers can write private methods on interfaces. As part of this change, my Java 8 [best practices talk](https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus17/preso/Java-SE-8-best-practices.pdf) slide 75  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812984/39844095-1f821504-53a3-11e8-9842-5b37f78c1997.png)  recommends that all methods on interfaces should be declared `public static`, `public abstract` or `public default` (plus `private` in Java 9).   In Java 9, the following combinations of modifiers are allowed on interfaces  https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8071453   First set: ""public static""  ""public abstract""  ""public default""  ""private static""  ""private""   Second set: ""static"" - same as ""public static""  ""abstract"" - same as ""public abstract""  ""public"" - same as ""public abstract""  """" - same as ""public abstract""  ""default"" - same as ""public default""   Since Java 8, I've argued that the existing coding standards for  interfaces are now wrong.  http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2013-April/015803.html  http://blog.joda.org/2016/09/private-methods-in-interfaces-in-java-9.html  https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus17/preso/Java-SE-8-best-practices.pdf slide 75   What should be clear from the above list is that the first set of  modfiers are consistent, and match modifiers on classes. The second  set of modifiers are inconsistent, and require the developer to  remember that an absence of a modifier means package-scoped on a  class, but public on an interface. At this point, the different  meanings for an absence of modifier are just a confusing anachronism  in Java. So, this is not about methods lining up in a column, this is  about consistency across classes and interfaces, now that interfaces  are much more like classes.   Currently `RedundantModifier` is applied everywhere - on interfaces and classes, no way for customization. The change I want to control what happens separately on interfaces and classes.  No violations on following interface are expected: ``` $ java -version java version ""1.8.0_172""  $ javac TestClass.java  $ cat TestClass.java public interface TestClass {    public static final int CONSTANT1 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   public static int CONSTANT2 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   public final int CONSTANT3 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   static final int CONSTANT4 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   final int CONSTANT5 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   static int CONSTANT6 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   public int CONSTANT7 = 1;  // VIOLATION now   int CONSTANT8 = 1;    public static boolean create1() { return true;}  // VIOLATION now   static boolean create2() { return true;}    public abstract void execute1();  // VIOLATION now   abstract void execute2();  // VIOLATION now   public void execute3();  // VIOLATION now    public default void execute4() {} // VIOLATION now   default void execute5() {}     //private static void execute6() {}  // jdk9 only   //private void execute7() {}  // jdk9 only }  $ cat TestConfig.xml                                           $ java -jar checkstyle-8.10-all.jar -c TestConfig.xml TestClass.java  Starting audit...

Checkstyle ends with 12 errors.  ```  I don't really want to constrain how this is implemented since I don't know the codebase.

This issue does not affect the Cobertura coverage, as it adds a pair of fields to the each class during the instrumentation phase.  A possible workaround is to extract this code to an utility method.

See conversation at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/5213#discussion_r155634192 .

I will continue looking into how to remedy this.  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/6d290adcd7efb8e9f07d2730e9960c6dc3e713ba/src/it/java/com/google/checkstyle/test/base/AbstractIndentationTestSupport.java#L58 This could easily be swapped with the called method in the class that uses it, but I think we might want to consider removing `AbstractIndentationTestSupport` completely since only 1 class uses it and in `test` we have no problem with all indentation being in 1 class.

"","5504","LocalVariableName should allow second character to be an upper case ASCII letter","The checkstyle predefined config file `google_checks.xml` disallows the second character of a variable name to be upper case.  Presumably, this is to enforce the [Google styleguide rule](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.1-identifier-names) of ""no special prefixes"" > In Google Style special prefixes or suffixes, like those seen in the examples `name_`, `mName`, `s_name` and `kName`, are not used.  This rule is to avoid prefixes which indicate what the type (int, bool, string, etc) or role (input variable, output variable, etc) or scope (field, local, etc) of the variable is.  However, there are also valid reasons to have a variable name consisting of a single lowercase letter followed immediately by an upper case letter. An example from my personal experience is `eId`, which is an abbreviation of ""expression ID"". Here, the `e` prefix is not a _""special""_ prefix, like the ones disallowed by the google style sheet, but rather a part of the abbreviation describing the variable.  I believe the `LocalVariableName` checkstyle module should have its format redefined, to allow such cases. A regular expression which would suffice for this would be `""^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$""`.    --------------  Current behaviour:  `andtho:/tmp$ javac Test.java`:  ``` ```  `andtho:/tmp$ cat Test.java`:  ``` public class Test {   /** Main method. */   public static void main(String[] args) {     // eId abbreviates ""expression ID""     String eId = ""Hello world!"";     System.out.println(eId);   } } ```  `andtho:/tmp$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml > config.xml` `andtho:/tmp$ cat config.xml`:  ``` …      …              …                                                                  …       ```  `andtho:/tmp$ java -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US -jar checkstyle-8.8-all.jar -c config.xml Test.java`:  ``` Starting audit...

Other usefull information would be:  * In what file the rule was violated (as there can be many in the package structure; even if you keep the number of them to minimum, having to check 3 files is an overhead). * What rule was violated, i.e. developers want to know if the whole package is blacklisted or only the class. * Why the class is blacklisted?  The two first could be solved by extending the current message format with extra placeholders, but the last one is more problematic as it requires extending the Import Control format, possibly updating the DTD.

Usage of additional files is problematic if verification should be done in multiple systems and IDEs (see https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/5756#issuecomment-393299082, ....). Additional problem is that there are two types of suppressions: - wide suppression (kind of part of style requirements, but Check does not allow this in configuration) - wont fix/false-positive suppressions. This suppressions are specific to certain code so could exists in separate file to be active only in certain project.  idea (new filter with all properties of SuppressionXpathFilter external files): ```               ```  another example: ```         ``` vs (separate xml file part)  ```   ```  it will NOT be compact, but it will be in-lined in main config, and we do not do revolutionary changes in project for now to allow all types of tags and inline configuration under module tag.

"","5114","Remove extra numeric offset in JavadocTokenTypes","RULE_TYPES_OFFSET constant is used to split lexer tokens types and parser rules types. We need unique numbers for all tokens, ANTLR do not need this and that is why his types are mixed by used values. All values we can take a look at `target/generated-sources/antlr/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocParser.java` for example: LEADING_ASTERISK=1 and RULE_htmlElement = 1. RULE_TYPES_OFFSET required to shift parser rules, to let them not overlap with types that have prefix ""RULE_"".  cases: ```     public static final int HTML_ELEMENT_START = JavadocParser.RULE_htmlElementStart             + RULE_TYPES_OFFSET + RULE_TYPES_OFFSET; ```  ```     public static final int ATTRIBUTE = JavadocParser.RULE_attribute             + RULE_TYPES_OFFSET + RULE_TYPES_OFFSET; ```  ```     public static final int HTML_COMMENT = JavadocParser.RULE_htmlComment             + RULE_TYPES_OFFSET + RULE_TYPES_OFFSET; ```  ToDo: 1) extent javadoc of RULE_TYPES_OFFSET by description that I gave in first paragraph 2) remove extra ""+ RULE_TYPES_OFFSET"" from that 3 cases.  This issue might result in braking compatibility and even weird behavior of custom checks which used that 3 token types in their code. As `static final int` is in-lined to custom Check code during compilation. Workaround is to recompile custom Checks(their jars).  Example of breaking compatibility: #505  Migration notes for users: users have to recompile their extensions to work without problems, as such constants are inlined in their code. So Checks might not receive proper call on token.","closed","breaking compatibility,","romani","2017-09-15T11:56:01Z","2017-10-20T18:44:15Z"

However, the quoted sentence mentions ""special prefixes"", and not any one-letter start. To understand what is a special prefix, I look at other specific Google's Guides where they do exist: https://source.android.com/source/code-style#follow-field-naming-conventions  https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Naming#Naming  So, this rule in Java guide should be read as ""there is no requirement to start an identifier from a specific char depending of the identifier role"".  So, identifier patterns should be updated to allow forms like `aVar` (which is not bad at all) and `aV` (which is bad in most cases, but is not strictly forbidden by the guide).  Related patterns I see: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/97669248fb2402e21cd372380a35d0e312c2a0e8/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml#L121 https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/97669248fb2402e21cd372380a35d0e312c2a0e8/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml#L126 https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/97669248fb2402e21cd372380a35d0e312c2a0e8/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml#L131 https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/97669248fb2402e21cd372380a35d0e312c2a0e8/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml#L137 https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/97669248fb2402e21cd372380a35d0e312c2a0e8/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml#L225","closed","","pelepelin","2017-09-25T17:26:14Z","2020-03-15T21:33:11Z"

The goal of the check is to ensure consistency between classes and interfaces, so that developers reading code are not required to know that the implicit default scope differs between interfaces and classes.   ``` public interface TestClass {    public static final int CONSTANT1 = 1;  // valid   public static int CONSTANT2 = 1;  // invalid, final missing   public final int CONSTANT3 = 1;  // invalid, static missing   static final int CONSTANT4 = 1;  // invalid, public missing   final int CONSTANT5 = 1;  // invalid, public & static missing   static int CONSTANT6 = 1;  // invalid, public & final missing   public int CONSTANT7 = 1;  // invalid, static & final missing   int CONSTANT8 = 1;  // invalid, all missing    public static boolean create1() { return true;}  // valid   static boolean create2() { return true;}  // invalid, public missing    public abstract void execute1();  // valid   abstract void execute2();  // invalid, public missing   public void execute3();  // invalid, abstract missing    public default void execute4() {}  // valid   default void execute5() {}  // invalid, public missing    //private static void execute6() {}  // jdk9 only: valid   //private default void execute7() {}  // jdk9 only: valid  } ```  Check should violate on all modifiers that aren't explicitly defined and are implied by the compiler. In this case, no visibility modifier is considered public. No abstract, static, or final in it's applicable locations are implied to be those. So we should define config and name as those that print violations on the implied modifiers that are not explicitly written out.  Design of Check: ```                                               ```   Hard to find the following references to ""redundant modifiers"" in the JLS:  - fields on interfaces - methods on interfaces - nested types on interfaces (implicitly static) - nested interfaces on classes (implicitly static) - nested enums on classes (implicitly static)  Note that the interface itself can be declared as `abstract`, but that usage is considered obsolete (9.1.1.1). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html  Quote from jls: >9.1.1.1. abstract Interfaces Every interface is implicitly abstract. This modifier is obsolete and should not be used in new programs.  >The modifier static pertains only to member interfaces (§8.5.1, §9.5), not to top level interfaces (§7.6).  There seems to be two use case groups here - interfaces (fields and methods) and nested types. @jodastephen think it would be perfectly reasonable to require `static` for nested types (in the cases above), so its not all about interfaces.  Message will be `Implied {0} modifier should be explicit in code`. So each property will specify which modifier is put to violation message.  If user doesn't want to write that specific modifier, they can use any that meets their requirements and removes the implied one. `violateImpliedPublicMethod` can be written as public or private (if the JDK version they are working with allows private). Writing private on the method removes the implied public, so violation shouldn't appear anymore.  If new modifiers are allowed in the future, check won't need to change as implied should always be backward compatible. Only if they break compatibility would we need to consider the same or create a work around (most likely the latter).","closed","new module,","romani","2018-06-10T15:23:22Z","2020-06-20T18:56:24Z"

However, this means that module-info.java files will also be excluded from the FileTabCharacter module, which can still usefully and successfully be applied to module-info.java files as it does not require parsing the Java syntax.  Therefore the proposal is to add new modules, like BeforeExecutionExclusionFileFilter, which can be more specific to the child TreeWalker and JavadocPackage modules. This means that FileTabCharacter, whose parent module is Checker, can be applied to module-info.java files even while other modules are more restrictive.

The second commit introduces a custom order for nodes to give to the routine. Attributes are still required to be in order. Order for translation will be based on file name and number of children for the file. The children need to be examined since the same file can appear multiple times. I added `checker.setBasedir(getPath(""""));` to this test so I could remove the need to rely on full file paths.","closed","","rnveach","2017-10-04T21:11:24Z","2017-12-25T22:50:19Z"

"","5176","ImportOrder: adjacent static import groups ones became impossible in 8.3","In Version 8.3 checkstyle start to enforce no blank lines within what it considers an import group. [ImportOrder](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_imports.html#ImportOrder)  In a project, we have a setup where static imports from a group are considered a group of its own, separated by a blank line. In terms of a an Eclipse-Importorder file it looks like this:      2=javax     1=\#java     0=java  As far as I understand the documentation and code in checkstyle, this means I cannot make checkstyle accept this kind of import order anymore. Previously 8.3 will only let me have static imports without a blank line separating them from their non-static counterparts or all of them together in a group at the very top or bottom.  Example import order that used to be OK but is not anymore:  ``` ➜  cat config.xml                                                                                         ➜  cat InputImportOrderGapBetweenStaticGroups.java import static java.lang.Math.abs; import static java.lang.Math.cos; // Attention: gap below  import static javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance;  public class InputImportOrderGapBetweenStaticGroups { }  # Error about extra separation between import groups ➜  java -jar checkstyle-8.3-all.jar -c config.xml InputImportOrderGapBetweenStaticGroups.java Starting audit... [ERROR] /var/tmp/InputImportOrderGapBetweenStaticGroups.java:4: Extra separation in import group before 'javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance' [ImportOrder] Audit done. Checkstyle ends with 1 errors.  # compare with Checkstyle 8.2: No error with separation ➜  java -jar checkstyle-8.2-all.jar -c config.xml InputImportOrderGapBetweenStaticGroups.java Starting audit... Audit done. ```  After removing separation: ERROR about missing separation. ``` ➜  cat InputImportOrderNoGapBetweenStaticGroups.java import static java.lang.Math.abs; import static java.lang.Math.cos; // no gap below import static javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance;  public class InputImportOrderNoGapBetweenStaticGroups { }  ➜  java -jar checkstyle-8.3-all.jar -c config.xml InputImportOrderNoGapBetweenStaticGroups.java Starting audit... [ERROR] /var/tmp/InputImportOrderNoGapBetweenStaticGroups.java:3: 'javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance' should be separated from previous imports. [ImportOrder] Audit done. Checkstyle ends with 1 errors.  ➜  java -jar checkstyle-8.2-all.jar -c config.xml InputImportOrderNoGapBetweenStaticGroups.java Starting audit... [ERROR] /var/tmp/InputImportOrderNoGapBetweenStaticGroups.java:3: 'javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory.newInstance' should be separated from previous imports. [ImportOrder] Audit done. Checkstyle ends with 1 errors. ```   I am not able to have two static import groups following each other without non-static imports between them in 8.3.  This used to work up to 8.2 using the same configuration.  This behaviour seems to have been introduced by a736d191a9d240a3a8b3a90b5651eb98b3af7d18, the fix for #5065. The suggested test above runs OK without it: https://github.com/ssp/checkstyle/commits/static-imports-between  My impression is that checkstyle unintentionally allowed this kind of import grouping because the of issue fixed by that patch and now cannot be configured anymore to allow it. Ideally we’d have both the fix of that patch and the interspersed static import groups.","closed","miscellaneous,","ssp","2017-10-08T10:27:42Z","2018-03-18T14:40:36Z"

"","5104","Checkstyle tests should be named after the class they test and extra validations/helpers should be in a special package","Identified at https://github.com/checkstyle/regression-tool/pull/85#issuecomment-325333038 ,  To be able to pull in properties from tests to be used in regression on a module, we need a clear connection between the test and the production code. This is usually defined by naming the test class after the production class and having them in the same package.  Some tests break this rule and we should rename/move them so they are in alignment and there is a clear connection between the 2 classes. Even if they aren't specifically modules, it will help ensure our tests match up to something. Eventually this should also help with pitest as everything will match up.  A UT should be created to make sure we don't break this in the future.  Examples of this being broken: ```` com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\checks\FileSetCheckLifecycleTest.java com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\checks\imports\ImportControlRegExpInPkgTest.java com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\checks\imports\ImportControlRegExpTest.java com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\filefilters\ExclusionBeforeExecutionFileFilterTest.java com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\filters\BeforeExecutionFileFilterSetTest.java com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\filters\FilterSetTest.java com\puppycrawl\tools\checkstyle\xpath\XpathMapperTest.java ````  `ExclusionBeforeExecutionFileFilterTest` is a UT for `BeforeExecutionExclusionFileFilter`. `BeforeExecutionFileFilterSetTest` is in `api` not `filters`. `FilterSetTest` is in `api` and not `filters`. `ImportControlRegExpInPkgTest`, and `ImportControlRegExpTest` are UTs for `ImportControl`. `XpathMapperTest` is more a UT for `RootNode` and all `Xpath` functionality really.

"","5057","TranslationCheck: should fire file started/finished when invoking errors","Identified at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/5043#discussion_r136685319 this issue is slightly related to multi-file validation,  PR wishes to remove file started/finished calls in `TranslationCheck`. See https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/5043/files  As pitest has proven these calls aren't needed because: After the check `destroy` executes from the violation, we run `fireAuditFinished` https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/07a730c0d1b89593e17fa8920faf9c226200e7b5/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Checker.java#L219-L223 and the XML logger clears out it's file cache if it hadn't before. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/07a730c0d1b89593e17fa8920faf9c226200e7b5/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/XMLLogger.java#L117-L118  So correct output is still here only because XML logger was extra careful in clearing out it's cache.  DefaultLogger doesn't care about files starting or finishing really. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/07a730c0d1b89593e17fa8920faf9c226200e7b5/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/DefaultLogger.java#L241-L248  ---  To me, it is weird we fire errors without a start/end file, but this check is already 'special' as it is related to multi-file mode. We can't assume any new listener made will know this weird behavior.  I suggest we undo the changes to `TranslationCheck` in that PR and in #5397 , and modify `XMLLogger` to not clear out it's cache as `fileFinished` should be the only one doing this. I assume removing the `fileMessages.forEach(this::writeFileMessages);` in XMLLogger's auditFinished would solve the pitest issue in this check and require the removed code to stay.","closed","approved,","rnveach","2017-09-02T14:15:26Z","2017-12-30T15:09:11Z"

One constructor is deprecated so I don't think the good constructor should be calling the deprecated one. There is no conversion from boolean to `OutputStreamOptions` that I can do in one line as required by a constructor call in a constructor unless I make a new method in `OutputStreamOptions` which would only be used for this purpose.

The referenced issue fixed a bug where we used `branchContains` and it was scanning deeper than the check originally intended. It was supposed to be looking for a variable with a `final` modifier, but because of `branchContains` it scanned into an anonymous class in the assignment and picked up the `final` there.  There may be other cases in our code where it might be searching too much. Example: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/55aa8cedc60d4faa776d7a36f8ae2d0bed0ada45/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/FinalParametersCheck.java#L144 Because we are doing a `branchContains` on the `METHOD_DEF` it is also searching inside the `SLIST` of the method and may pick-up anonymous classes while it is looking for `PARAMETER_DEF`.  I feel `branchContains` should be completely removed as it's search area can't be controlled. If we don't want to remove it, it's use should be heavily controlled.  We should swap it's current uses with either `findFirstToken` or a new method in each check that specifically controls where and what we are looking for.","closed","miscellaneous,","rnveach","2017-09-18T18:54:17Z","2019-10-03T10:56:16Z"

One thing that almost all checks need is a way to identify if an ident is a field/variable/parameter and to examine the context of the line knowing this information. Sometimes I need to re-look at the variables type, and sometimes name clashes make the check more complicated. Unfortunately there is no utility in checkstyle to help check makers do this and we are forced to make assumptions or to re-invent the wheel.   [One check that does do in-depth analysis of variables is RequireThisCheck](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/32e2b7ba57e189074662d84a04535a87c3a19b0c/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/coding/RequireThisCheck.java#L209-L226). It would be great if we could take this analysis out of the Check and move it to a common utility so all can make use of it.  We could call this utility `FrameTrackingUtil` and give it the following methods. `RequireThisCheck.beginTree` can be moved into `FrameTrackingUtil.reset`. We can give it the following methods to make use of. `getVariablesByName` can find the variables/parameters/etc in the given scope of the current method and return it's AST. `getMethodByName` can find the method in the given scope of the current class and return it's AST. `getVariables` can return all the variables in the given scope. `getMethods` can return all the methods in the given scope. etc...

[JavadocMethod] Audit done. Checkstyle ends with 39 errors. ````  The problem occurs under these conditions: 1) 2 checks must be defined in the configuration. One check must be TranslationCheck, doesn't matter what the other is as long as it produces a violation. 2) The files to be run must be in the order of any type of file that produces a violation by the first check, and a property file. 3) In Checker, TranslationCheck must be executed first followed by the check that produces a violation.  When this occurs, TranslationCheck leaks the violations when the `finishProcessing` method is run from the previous Check and assigns those violations under the File name TranslationCheck is using.  Code to prove my case: When a check is run and finished, we grab the violations and return them to the caller. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AbstractFileSetCheck.java#L77-L84 The problem is we don't erase the field `MESSAGE_COLLECTOR` after this method is run. We expect a 2nd method call to erase the list, but if it is never run, the list is kept populated. [When `finishProcessing` is called for TranslationCheck](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Checker.java#L219), [it always calls `fireErrors` regardless if errors were generated or not](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/TranslationCheck.java#L466). But we never produced any new violations or cleared out the list from the last run, so we leak violations from the previous `process` call and reprint them under the `TranslationCheck` file it is examining. This doesn't leak more violations because we clear the violation list after the first call to `fireErrors`. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AbstractFileSetCheck.java#L174-L177","closed","approved,","rnveach","2017-11-14T14:20:01Z","2017-11-18T01:43:32Z"

"","5676","consider introducing spelling regression checker","https://github.com/jsoref/spelling has a number of scripts for managing spelling, but only three are relevant to this, and I suspect you'll end up using one as is and writing a rolled up version of the other two:  * `w` takes a stream of text and identifies suspicious words -- I'd encourage you to use this as is. * `f` looks decides which files to feed to `w` and then runs them through `w` -- the algorithm it uses may not be suitable for your project. In general, I end up manually deleting (i.e. ""excluding"") files. * `fchurn` this script runs `f` saving its output to a file, and the next time you run it, it compares the output of the current run -- in theory, it's designed to be used for precisely this task. Its output is any ""newly"" introduced tokens, which are either ""misspellings"" or ""acceptable"".  The file `fchurn` produces can be committed into the repository, or, if you are willing to rely on `git`, you could have your `fchurn` figure out the answer by generating the answer for the previous (or referenced) commit. By storing the output file into the repository, you're essentially listing ""accepted"" ""misspellings"" -- a whitelist.  Fwiw, you can compress or similarly obfuscate the whitelist so that it doesn't upset anyone else's spell checking tools (or just to conserve space).  Offhand, I suspect that the right place for the file to live would be `.ci`.  Hopefully, this information is a helpful outline. I may try to put together an actual PR for this, but probably not imminently.","closed","miscellaneous,","jsoref","2018-04-01T15:46:01Z","2018-04-19T01:02:01Z"

This slows down the pitest run considerably. Pitest can't recognize all instances of an infinite loop, and if the mutated code isn't an infinite loop, but takes a long time to finish, it can cause issues with mutation scoring. I ran into this problem within my own project. An `uncertain` mutation is flagged and counted as a killed. However, if it is the edge of finishing before the timeout and does so in some circumstances, it could be flagged as `survived` and lower the score creating different results in different runs.  https://app.shippable.com/github/rnveach/checkstyle/runs/3/summary/console Lists all the jobs who have uncertainties as `failed`.  It is possible to remove the uncertain instances by rewriting the code some.

Artifacts functionality has been working great for our customers since we introduced it in 2013, but we collected a huge amount of artifacts which are persisting in cloud storage.  Through talking to many customers we’ve identified that, after some period of time, storing old artifacts is unnecessary.  Indeed, once the app is deployed or a release package uploaded to external storage, its underlying artifact is usually no longer needed (except for those rare moments when some previous/stable release has to be re-deployed!)  To reduce AppVeyor hosting costs and eliminate any unnecessary waste of cloud resources we decided to introduce an artifacts retention policy.  The policy states that build artifacts and NuGet packages of paid accounts older than 6 months and free accounts older than 3 months  will be permanently removed from AppVeyor artifact storage.  This policy will take effect on June 7, 2018.  If you have custom requirements please let us know and we'll discuss your needs.

Line and column numbers are integer values separated by a :, specify location in the file the suppression should be generated for. The option cannot be used with other options and requires exactly one file to run on to be specified.  noticed during https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/5762#discussion_r192256278,   looks like it is due to the fact that Check report problem on non text element from code, but to some AST token we can be sure what AST node to use for xpath generation. So we generate xpath for all tokens which are on the same line and column.  my experiment: ``` $ cat config.xml                                                       $ cat TestClass.java  package org.checkstyle.suppressionxpathfilter.cyclomaticcomplexity;  public class SuppressionXpathRegressionCyclomaticOne {     public void test(int a, int b) { //warn         if (a > b) {          } else {          }     }  $ java -jar checkstyle-8.10-all.jar -c config.xml TestClass.java  Starting audit...

"","5486","Issue #2974: Fix EmptyLineSeparator check when class members are separated by comments","Hi,   I've attempted to fix issue #2974. I think I've managed to capture all of the edge cases by parsing comments from the beginning of the file. The code is quite complex, but I think that it needs to be due to all of the possible edge cases.  My test case covers all by 2 conditional branches in the new code. This means that the coverage check is failing.  I'm not expecting this pull-request to be merged at this stage, but as someone who hasn't contributed to Checkstyle before, I think I need some help with how to cover these 2 conditions. They only occur with invalid Java source files that have a single trailing slash at the end of a line. I can't work out how to add an invalid Java source file without the compiler complaining in the IDE. I tried giving the source file the extension "".txt"", but the `TreeWalker` filters out files not ending with "".java"".  As far as I am aware, all of the other checks are passing.

The URL of the service changed from https://sonarqube.com to https://sonarcloud.io.  I am contacting you because we noticed that you are still using the old URL (sonarqube.com) to point to the service when you run analyses. Typically, this is set through the ""sonar.host.url"" property in your build scripts, or in your CI tool configuration (like an end-point in VSTS or a global config in Jenkins).  In a few months, we are going to drop the old URL to keep only https://sonarcloud.io. You probably want to take a look at this early to prevent any futur errors in your build jobs.  Also, if you are using Travis as your CI engine to trigger the analyses, I suggest that you take a look at our Travis Add-on. Relying on this add-on would allow to not be impacted by potential similar changes in the future.  Hope you enjoy the service!

And my strict position is to not use any personal resources on this to not depend on single person.  so I propose this issue to move the website that is currently on http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net to http://[wwww.]checkstyle.org. This should hopefully be  possible using GitHub pages - I've done this myself for a few of my projects, and am willing to find the time to make a (small!) contribution to CS to help get this set up.  Just for the purpose of containing scope and have ""actionable"" issue, I also propose that this issue is strictly limited to moving the static content that today is on http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net, **exactly as it is**, over to a checkstyle.org.   We probably should have the discussion about what to the with the existing site - HTTP redirects? At root? On every page??   But IMHO we should use other new issues for any discussion related to _""a good opportunity to revamp the site as well, as it is a bit dated.""_ and _""propose using a more modern static site generator like Jekyll (which integrates well with GitHub Pages). The upshot of doing it this way would be that the site content could just be (mostly) written with Markdown instead of xdoc.""_ (@ntsim) nor ""release uploads"" related stuff (@misery) - I can only encourage anyone with bandwith to help driving those possible follow ups to this issue in new issues (which I personally will not have the capacity to help with).  So I think what that this boils down to is just (a) do a test to confirm we can host content on checkstyle.org using GitHub pages (test that CNAME thing we'll have to do), and then (b) get the Travis CI master build job to push the output produced by ""mvn clean site"" to where we ended up hosting the generated content for checkstyle.org - which I'm guessing will either be the ""gh-pages"" branch of this repo, or a new repo like www.checkstyle.org under this org; what's easier, anyone?  @romani can you confirm that you have DNS control over checkstyle.org ?","closed","deploy,","vorburger","2018-03-09T13:40:26Z","2019-12-13T00:46:05Z"

"","5082","Fix up Portuguese messages","Fix up the horrible broken Portuguese translation.  The Portuguese translation of Checkstyle is one of the worst I've seen. The current translation features very badly translated words, very broken and malformed Portuguese grammar and also mixes up inconsistently the Brazilian and European dialects. It is so awful and unreliable that many of the messages reads as utterly useless gibberish in Portuguese and most of the times that I use checkstyle (which sees that Portuguese is my language due to my Locale), for at least some messages, I must check the original English messages to make any sense of them.  I thought about opening up an issue for that. However, I think that a PR is simply more productive. My translation (hopefully) fixes all the bad Portuguese messages. Even if I took one of two of them wrong, they are waaaay better than what it was before.  I standardized them into PT_BR (Brazilian Portuguese), spoken by much more people than the PT_PT one (spoken in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique and a few other countries). I would appreciate to provide a proper PT_PT translation in the near future, using as its starting point the PT_BR one that I'm providing (just a few sentences would need to be rewritten). However, I can't provide one right now.  Here are some of the really bad examples:  ----  **Example:** _Annotation array values cannot contain trailing comma._ **How it was translated:** _Anotação valores de matriz não pode conter fuga vírgula._ **What does the translation means in English:** _Matrix values annotation cannot contain comma run away._ **Proposed new translation:** _A lista de valores de um array de anotações não pode ser terminada em uma vírgula._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _The list of values of an annotation array cannot be finished with a comma._  ----  **Example:** _Duplicate {0} tag._ **How it was translated:** _Duplicar {0} tag._ **Translating back to English:** _To duplicate tag {0}._ **How it should be interpreted by a programmer in English:** _Oops, we found the {0} tag duplicated. You should not do that!_ **How does the translation would be interpreted by a programmer in Portuguese:** _You should duplicate the tag {0}._  The problem here is that the ""duplicate"" word which meant to be as an adjective in English was taken as a verb in Portuguese and the result translation was exactly the opposite of what it should be. There weren't enough context in the original message for a reasonable machine translation.  **Proposed new translation:** _A tag {0} não deveria ser duplicada._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _The tag {0} should not be duplicated._  ----  **Example:** _Don''t use trailing comments._ **How it was translated:** _Don 't usar arrastando comentários._  Yuck! Here, the sentence is part in English and part in Portuguese. ""Don 't"" do not means anything at all in Portuguese.  **What does the part actually translated in Portuguese means in English:** _to use dragging comments._ **Proposed new translation**: _Não use comentários no final de linhas._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _Do not use comments at line endings._  ----  **Example:** _Must include both @java.lang.Deprecated annotation and @deprecated Javadoc tag with description._ **How it was translated:** _Deve incluir tanto @ anotação java.lang.Deprecated e tag Javadocdeprecated com a descrição._ **What does the translation means in English:** _Must include much @ annotation java.lang.Deprecated and tag Javadocdeprecated with the description._  This translation is particularly awful because one of the `@` sign was dropped and other was separated from the annotation name. ""Javadocdeprecated"" was smashed together into a single word. It also features horribly broken Portuguese grammar.  **Proposed new translation:** _Deveria incluir tanto a anotação @java.lang.Deprecated como a tag @deprecated do Javadoc com a devida descrição._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _Should include both the annotation @java.lang.Deprecated just as the @deprecated Javadoc tag with the needed description._  ----  **Example:** _Default should be last label in the switch._ **How it was translated:** _Padrão deve ser a última etiqueta no interruptor._ **What does the translation means in English:** _Pattern must be the last ticket in interrupter._ **Proposed new translation:** _O default deve ser a última entrada no switch._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _The default must be the last input in the switch._  ----  **Example:** _String literal expressions should be on the left side of an equals comparison._ **How it was translated:** _Corda expressões literais deve estar no lado esquerdo de um é igual comparação._ **What does the translation means in English:** _Literal expressions rope must be in the left side of a one is equal comparision._  WOW! That awful translation simply makes my eyes bleed!  **Proposed new translation:** _Literais de String deveriam estar no lado esquerdo de comparações feitas com equals._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _String literals should be in the left side of comparisons performed with equals._  ----  **Example:** _Throwing ''{0}'' is not allowed._ **How it was translated:** _Jogando ''{0}'' não é permitido._ **What does the translation means in English:** _Playing ''{0}'' is not allowed._ **Proposed new translation:** _Lançar ''{0}'' não é permitido._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _Throw ''{0}'' is not allowed._  ----  **Example:** _File match folder pattern ''{0}'' and file pattern ''{1}''._ **How it was translated (using the wrong encoding):** _Arquivo padr�o pasta jogo ''{0}'' e arquivo padr�o ''{1}''._ **What does the translation means in English:** _Standard file folder game ''{0}}'' and standard file ''{1}''._ **Proposed new translation:** _O nome do arquivo condiz com o padrão ''{0}'' para pastas e com o padrão ''{1}'' para arquivos._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _The file name matches the pattern ''{0}'' for folders and the pattern ''{1}'' for files._  ----  **Example:** _{0} statement should not be line-wrapped._ **How it was translated:** _{0} afirmação não deve ser linha-embrulhado._ **What does the translation means in English:** _{0} affirmation should not be line-embroiled._ **Proposed new translation:** _A instrução {0} não deveria ser dividida em mais de uma linha._ **Translation back in English of the proposal:** _The instruction {0} should not be splitted into more than one line._","closed","miscellaneous,","victorwss","2017-09-06T17:50:48Z","2017-09-14T13:02:04Z"

This should be fixed!  daniilyar commented a day ago >@jansohn, we don't have an SSL certificate. There is nothing to protect on checkstyle.org with SSL encryption I believe. I think there is no way to configure redirect from HTTPS to HTTP or put certificate or disable HTTPS completely on github.io. We also don't have any computing resources in the cloud where we would be able to install some reverse proxy (Nginx) with SSL certificate and automatic certificate renew. I think that the proper way to prevent https browser warnings for users is to redirect HTTPS to HTTP which again points us to the need to host site on some instance in the cloud instead of github.io  jansohn commented 17 hours ago >I disagree that there is nothing to protect. Downloading the Eclipse plugin is one example I can think of which should be protected from MITM. I've no experience with github.io pages but before this redirect to checkstyle.org I could use an https URL to protect the Eclipse plugin update site.  romani commented 11 hours ago • > @lkoe and/or @Bananeweizen please remind us history of https resources for eclipse-cs . I think, there was no https on sourceforge. Https appeared when eclipse-cs migrated to GitHub.io . As GitHub allow both by default. Now it becomes not possible again as we use custom domain name. Example of build failure with this https-->http redirection - https://travis-ci.org/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/jobs/359606354#L722 , noticed by @jsoref . We downgraded to http for now in our satellite project.  daniilyar commented 8 hours ago • >@jansohn, thanks for clarifying about Eclipse update site! I think you are right, unencrypted Eclipse update site is a real security concern. @romani, taking this into account, I believe the proper way for us is to use a custom domain name with TLS encryption and http --> https redirect is to setup Nginx on the cloud with letsencrypt cert and host / proxy all our public resources (DTDs, Eclipse update site, Maven site, etc.) with it.  romani commented 7 hours ago > It was always as http (sourceforge), it become as https only for few weeks (xxxx.github.io). So we come back to where we were for many many years. So is users still would love to have https ... lets open new issue on this. I am ok to think about https .... but after final migration to github and we need to get to know how to do this with github.io . There should good security concerns to force our team to bother with certificates renewal each several month or ..... we need help for this topic.  jansohn commented 2 hours ago >Netlify seems to provide a free solution to this problem: https://www.radibit.com/2017/01/29/https-setup-for-github-pages.html  daniilyar commented 38 minutes ago >@jansohn, I saw this one. The issue with it is that it does not refresh the letsencrypt certificate automatically so one should manually update it each 90days. Letsencrypt wants to even reduce this period in future. AFAIK, the only solution when we can setup the reliable certificate auto-refresh is when there is a cloud host with Nginx and cron certificate refresh rule. I've spinned up some instance for Checkstyle at AWS free tier recently for CI purposes and I believe we may put the site there also which should solve both TLS issue and certificate auto renewal issue. But if somebody can suggest a service that provides a cloud instance with static IP forever and for free that would be great as AWS free tier only lasts 1y. I have requested such a free instance from Scaleway and Rackspace hostings on Checkstyle organization behalf so far but both refused to give it or 'sponsor' it.","closed","miscellaneous,","romani","2018-03-29T23:39:35Z","2018-06-08T04:49:59Z"

I have to use a listener as it is the only customizable area that is called at the end once all other modules, filters, and such are done.  When my custom AuditListener tries to fire violations in `auditFinished` those violations are printed to the console, but it turns out they aren't counted towards the total violation count. This may have always been an issue and I just never noticed it before.  The problem is with the following code: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/5a6a87ac206590f8b5795cccb0109b9c87b2ef1c/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/Checker.java#L220-L222  We retrieve the error counter before firing the AuditListeners for the last time that tells everyone we are finished and this is the value we directly returned for the count display. When AuditListeners fire errors at this point, they are counted correctly but because of the local variable save of `errorCount` before the `fireAuditFinished` call, those counts are ignored. Since we are not using this value anywhere except returning it, `counter.getCount()` should be moved and inlined into the `return` line, so that if any AuditListeners fire their own errors, they will be included in the total count.","closed","","rnveach","2017-09-18T14:55:25Z","2019-02-27T14:19:20Z"

This is needed to support https://checkstyle.org/config_filters.html#SuppressionXpathFilter which needs the AST of the violation to match it to the user supplied XPath.  As PR is started for each check, links from master ( Ex: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/blocks/EmptyBlockCheck.java#L201 ) must be posted to show each log call found in the check. An additional note must be made of the number of logs actually modified. This will greatly help admins ensure the full check is now xpath compliant and nothing is missed.  All checks need to be reviewed to ensure: 1) All their calls to `log` pass the AST and not the line/column 2) Each log have a respective IT test to show that it supports xpath at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master/src/it/java/org/checkstyle/suppressionxpathfilter 3) Documentation of https://checkstyle.org/config_filters.html#SuppressionXpathFilter_Description shows the check is now supported. 4) Since this is modifying the functionality of a check, regression will be required for the PR.

It is better to invest time ones for Test.java and config (config could build in runtime) for each Check we support, run validation from UT, run suppressions generation, verify it content by assert, append suppression to config, run one time, verify no violations.

See: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/90f20e09869c71eb22190ad9c1d46d5deec324a5/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/imports/ImportControl.java#L215  Most users expect rules to be obeyed in order they are written in the file and so should be match in reading order from top to bottom.  ## Migration for users  This only affects users who: * disables a package and allow a class in the disabled package * allows a package and disables a class in the allowed package * mistakenly allows or disallows the same package/class twice  If you are affected by this, the rules that match one of the above should be swapped to fix the issue. Here is an example if you are forbidding a class of an allowed package. If your import control file looks like: ````         ```` You must swap the 2 rules for the new fix.

"","5411","New MissingJavadocCheck(s)","As discussed at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/4983#issuecomment-350503360 ,  once we start converting old Java checks using Javadoc regular expression to Javadoc checks using grammar, we lose the functionality of reporting a violation on an item if a Javadoc is missing.  [MissingDeprecated](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_annotation.html#MissingDeprecated) has an property `skipNoJavadoc` which will skip violations if a javadoc is missing on a deprecated method. [JavadocMethodCheck](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_javadoc.html#JavadocMethod) has various properties like `minLineCount` and `allowedAnnotations` which will not print a missing javadoc violation if the number of lines in the method are too small or it contains an annotation.  We can't remove these functionalities, so we need to split them into new check(s) that will remain as Java checks. Their only purpose will be to report a violation if a javadoc is needed.  We need to examine all these properties of our Java checks that examine Javadocs and decide how to best to split them out. Should we have a new check for each type (Class, Method, etc...) or should they all be contained into 1 check? Which properties do these new check(s) need from our existing checks? We will need to create a complete list.  Once this is done we can complete https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/4983.    ---------------------  **Migration Note**  For JavadocType, functionality for validating missing javadocs was split into a new check MissingJavadocType. `scope` and `excludeScope` properties were brought to the new check. `allowedAnnotations` was brought over but renamed to `skipAnnotations`.","closed","new module,","rnveach","2017-12-31T17:58:56Z","2019-04-30T02:53:00Z"

This Jenkins instance should be publically accessible, so anybody who posted the new PR should be able to review the build log for it in Jenkins Jenkins should build each pull request in this repository using the Jenkins pipeline job. Jenkins pipeline job code (aka Jenkinsfile) should be stored in this repository. At the very first step, Jenkins build pipeline should just run the simple 'ls' command. This will allow us to not fail any PRs until the Jenkins PR testing workflow itself is well-tested.  After we test the PR building workflow well enough, we should create the separate issue to setup real tests in the pipeline, such as running UTs with Maven and so on.  Then we should use Hyper.sh as the main Jenkins computing resources provider (i.e. any CPU or memory-aggressive Jenkins build should happen in the Hyper.sh container).  Initially, Jenkins master can run builds on it's own executors, but eventually, we should have few Jenkins slaves running under the master, so master will only act as a simple job scheduler and UI while all builds will actually happen on slaves and delegated from slaves to Hyper.sh.","closed","CI,","daniilyar","2018-06-21T22:04:13Z","2019-01-08T21:22:11Z"

Checkstyle ends with 1 errors. ``` Checkstyle do exactly what is required.  But the feature of separating static imports when they are at top/bottom seems is required from conversation of [Issue #5176](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/5176#issuecomment-340625283). So, we can add a option named `separatedStaticGroups` which means whether static imports grouped by top or bottom option are separated by local groups. Example1: ```                                           ``` Then CheckStyle's behavior is same as before checkstyle8.3, all static imports as one group.  Example2: ```                                           ``` Static imports at top should be seaparated by local groups.And static imports should be sorted in the groups alphabetically.  Example3: ```                                           ``` When you specify package groupings inside ImportOrder, that same ordering is applied to the single group of static imports.  I think it is keeping with original design of sortStaticImportsAlphabetically at [Issue #12](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/12) `To clarify, when static imports are grouped into a single block of text without any empty lines between them, I want them to be sorted alphabetically rather than in the package order.` but also satisfy requirement of sorting/separate static imports by local groups.

Checkstyle ends with 1 errors. ```  ---------------  Describe what you expect in detail.  I'm attempting to upgrade from version 6.19 to version 8.8. The above used to work fine, but now I get a couple hundred errors like this. This behavior was introduced between 8.2 and 8.3.  If I set `separated` to false, I get less errors, but they still occur when `javax.` imports are followed by `java.` imports with no white line between them. I tried changing the `groups` to something like `*,javax?` (to make `javax.` and `java.` a single group) but that didn't help either.  Note that this configuration is identical to what's written on [this documentation page](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_imports.html#ImportOrder) where it says `Note: ""separated"" option is disabled because IDEA default has blank line between ""java"" and static imports, and no blank line between ""javax"" and ""java""` which is exactly what I'm trying to achieve.  If you tell me what I need to change in my configuration, I'm willing to update the docs and submit a PR for that.  You can reproduce the issue on the EqualsVerifier repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier). Check out the branch `upgrade-checkstyle` and run on Java 9 with `mvn checkstyle:checkstyle`.

So I woulnd't see any error message for the class above.  I think there are two options required, one for prefix (in the above case `with` would be the prefix) and one for excluding a method that has exact same name as the field. Such methods should be allowed to have a hidden field. Both of those are frequently used in builders.  Another option is doing an analysis of the method and checking for a field `id`, that the method has `this.id`. If such string exists inside it, then consider ignoring HiddenField check in such method. This would be most desired but I think it would required more work.","closed","","krzyk","2017-10-23T18:50:42Z","2017-11-19T01:25:12Z"

And nothing I do seems to make the second string or number generate an error.  This inconsistency has bitten one of my students, whose actual use case was somewhat more complicated.  He was sufficiently confused that he thought the problem was the style checker can't handle nested lambdas (i.e., he had a curried function `(arg1) -> (arg2) -> (arg3) -> answer`), but it seems from this reduced case that the problem really lies with enum values with constructor arguments.","closed","indentation,","blerner","2017-11-03T15:11:06Z","2020-10-04T19:08:21Z"

The current implementation works only with single line comments.  -------------------  In my opinion, we may apply factory pattern to create the instances of Suppression class. The class constructor has some messy logic (same is for SuppressionCommentFilter). I noticed that almost all Checkstyle checks contains too many if-else logic. No abstraction, no OOP at all.   @romani, some [quotes from your blog](http://roman-ivanov.blogspot.ru/2015/10/software-quality-award-comment-for.html): > I do not share fanatic following of pure OOP designs, I am more in favor of changes to be more functional. Any re-factoring in favor of OOP is not possible without braking compatibility with plugins/extensions.  I agree with you, however as we decided to keep the whole check logic inside one class, why we cannot use some OOP practises in the scope of this particular class if they are not visible outside?  > Utility is good as it is stateless realization of algorithms.  Utilities are good if they implement small algorithms, but the logic of Checkstyle checks overcame that border. The users always require new features and changes, which will lead us to the code which is very hard to maintain as it is full of if-else-if-else logic, strange computations.   It is just my opinion, something to think about.","closed","","MEZk","2017-10-21T13:38:03Z","2017-12-29T15:16:19Z"
