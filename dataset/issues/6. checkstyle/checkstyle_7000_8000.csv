"","4999","XpathQueryGenerator should consider tabWith parameter","XpathQueryGenerator should have tabWith parameter. Default value is 4.  Use case: user specified lineNo = 1 and columnNo = 5 to generate the suppression for file Test.java. Line 1 has 1 tab character. XpathQueryGenerator should calculate the real position of the token to generate suppression xpath as ANTLR parser treats tab characters as one symbol. So if user sees the violation: ```1:5: violation message``` he should be able to pass this values to the generator. The generator should determine the real position of the token.  Algorithm:  1) tabWith = 4, lineNo = 1, columnNo = 10; realColumnNo = 1; 2) Read line 1 char by char till columnNo; 3) If tab is detected, than tabCount++; 4) Find token with lineNo = 1 and columnNo = 10 - tabWith * tabCount.","closed","miscellaneous,","MEZk","2017-08-24T19:13:14Z","2017-09-17T14:02:16Z"
"","4419","Add token type to LocalizedMessage","XPath to AST mapper which will be implemented in the scope of #4369 will help us to find AST node which corresponds the XPath expression starting from the root. When the AST node is found, we need to compare the node with the AST node which causes the violation. If they are equal, the audit event need to be denied.   For example, if we have the following XPath expression to suppress a violation logged by MethodLengthCheck  ```java //CLASS_DEF//METHOD_DEF[@Text='foo'] ```  then the mapper will return the method definition AST node. MethodLengthCheck emits the violation for method ```foo```. We need to log method definition AST node, because we should compare the node with the AST node given by mapper. If both nodes are equal, then audit event (violation) should be denied.    Thus, in order to suppress the violation by XPath expression we need to have the AST node which causes the violation. However, now the whole information about a violation (lineNo, columnNo, etc) is collected in LocalizedMessage. I propose to rename LocalizedMessage to Violation ann [log](https://github.com/MEZk/checkstyle/blob/154f120d7b71c30ec64f3ef801fb080a24a21c4a/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/AbstractViolationReporter.java#L143-L143) AST everywhere.

The configuration file is put under a special name and not under it's file name, so it will never be removed by a violation.  However, if we remove an external resource from the cachefile because of a violation, it invalidates the entire cachefile on the next run as they are required to be in the cachefile. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/6a8730f03c2114a894a583731cc89bc2ec559978/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/PropertyCacheFile.java#L249-L250  External resources are considered to be changed if they aren't in the cachefile.  ------------------- Here is how to reproduce:  Step 1: Environment ```` $ cat TestClass.java public class TestClass {     void method() {     } }  $ cat TestConfig.xml                                                             $ cat suppressions.xml       ````  Step 2: the good run ```` $ java -jar checkstyle-7.6.1-all.jar -c TestConfig.xml TestClass.java suppressions.xml Starting audit...

The field stores xpath-expression passed from SuppressionLoader to XpathFilter by invoking setXpathQuery; 2) The filter should have ```accept``` method which receives an audit event;   3) Inside ```accept``` method the filter should extract root AST node from audit event object, and AST node which caused a violation; 4) XPath-to-AST mapper should extract the node which should be suppressed starting from the root. If this node is equal to the node which caused the violation, then the filter should deny the audit event.","closed","miscellaneous,","MEZk","2017-06-05T19:40:51Z","2017-08-23T15:14:35Z"

"","4369","Mapper of XPath expressions onto AST nodes","We need  to investigate how to map XPath expressions onto AST nodes. To begin with, it is worth designing a model of mapper which will allow to map XPath expressions onto AST nodes. The main idea of the mapper is to connect XPath expressions which will be based on the values of [TokenTypes](https://github.com/MEZk/checkstyle/blob/dabe377fd60374da3c5cfaddc8126847468b65ef/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/TokenTypes.java#L34-L34) enum onto the nodes of DetailAST.   For example, if we have the following code fragment: ```java public class TestClass {     void method() {     } } ```  the following tree structure: ```xml CLASS_DEF -> CLASS_DEF [1:0] |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [1:0] |  `--LITERAL_PUBLIC -> public [1:0] |--LITERAL_CLASS -> class [1:7] |--IDENT -> TestClass [1:13] `--OBJBLOCK -> OBJBLOCK [1:23]     |--LCURLY -> { [1:23]     |--METHOD_DEF -> METHOD_DEF [2:4]     |  |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [2:4]     |  |--TYPE -> TYPE [2:4]     |  |  `--LITERAL_VOID -> void [2:4]     |  |--IDENT -> method [2:9]     |  |--LPAREN -> ( [2:15]     |  |--PARAMETERS -> PARAMETERS [2:16]     |  |--RPAREN -> ) [2:16]     |  `--SLIST -> { [2:18]     |      `--RCURLY -> } [3:4]     `--RCURLY -> } [4:0] ```  and the following XPath expression (example, format should be discussed): ```xml //ClassDef[@Text='TestClass'] ```  than the parser should connect the XPath expression elements with the AST nodes in this way:  ``` DetailAST (type: CLASS_DEF, text: ""TestClass"") <- XpathExpression(ClassDef, text: ""TestClass"") ```  The base idea can be taken from PMD. They implemented both Saxon and Jaxen mappers. From my point of view, Saxon mapper is easier to reimplement for our needs. [Saxon XPath rule mapper](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/d92688a07dc5e6edc3bfc81cced6f25c951a19f4/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/xpath/SaxonXPathRuleQuery.java#L40-L40) maps each XPath node onto AST node. Their algorithm is based on [the tree traversal algorithm](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/d92688a07dc5e6edc3bfc81cced6f25c951a19f4/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/xpath/saxon/ElementNode.java#L38-L38). They [map](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/d92688a07dc5e6edc3bfc81cced6f25c951a19f4/pmd-core/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/ast/xpath/saxon/ElementNode.java#L46-L46) each node of the AST starting with root onto XPath element.  **Thus, what should be done in the scope of this issue:** 1. Design XPath expression format for the new Checkstyle Suppression Model; 2. Investigate what library (Saxon, Jaxen, or native Java) should be used to implement mapper; 3. Provide base details of mapper model implementation (UML diagram of classes can be a good example).","closed","miscellaneous,","MEZk","2017-05-22T20:20:28Z","2017-08-10T21:18:59Z"

"","4415","Create XPath tree as clone of DetailAST tree","The problem was found in https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3095 .  Due to the fact that AST tree does not have the root node, we have 2 pseudo-root nodes: 1) PACKAGE_DEF 2) CLASS_DEF  For example,  ```java package my.pack;  public class TestClass { } ```  ``` PACKAGE_DEF -> package [1:0] |--ANNOTATIONS -> ANNOTATIONS [1:10] |--DOT -> . [1:10] |  |--IDENT -> my [1:8] |  `--IDENT -> pack [1:11] `--SEMI -> ; [1:15] CLASS_DEF -> CLASS_DEF [3:0] |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [3:0] |  `--LITERAL_PUBLIC -> public [3:0] |--LITERAL_CLASS -> class [3:7] |--IDENT -> TestClass [3:13] `--OBJBLOCK -> OBJBLOCK [3:23]     |--LCURLY -> { [3:23]     `--RCURLY -> } [4:0] ```  As it can be seen from the example, the tree does not have the root. PACKAGE_DEF and CLASS_DEF are siblings. It also can be proven by the following test:   TestAst: ```java package com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle;  public class TestAst {  }  ```  ```java @Test public void testRootAst() throws Exception{     final FileText text = new FileText(new File(""src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/TestAst.java""),         System.getProperty(""file.encoding"", ""UTF-8""));     final FileContents contents = new FileContents(text);      DetailAST rootAST = TreeWalker.parse(contents);          assertEquals(null, rootAST.getParent());     assertEquals(null, rootAST.getNextSibling().getParent()); }  ```  The test shows that two nodes do not have a parent.  JLS says that > CompilationUnit is the goal symbol (§2.1) for the syntactic grammar (§2.3) of Java programs.  and  > Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the goal symbol, a given context-free grammar specifies a language, namely, the set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.  and finally   > A syntactic grammar for the Java programming language is given in Chapters 4, 6-10, 14, and 15. This grammar has tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol CompilationUnit (§7.3), that describe how sequences of tokens can form syntactically correct programs.  Thus, from my point of view, ```compilation unit``` should be the root of the tree. By the way, PMD declares ```compilation unit``` as a root. See https://github.com/pmd/pmd/blob/511c7778c5bc2e8718e7cd3c7fec85937a493315/pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/ast/ASTCompilationUnit.java#L15-L15    This issue blocks https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/4369 Saxon framework for Xpath has [NodeInfo](http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/javadoc/net/sf/saxon/om/NodeInfo.html) interface which is going to be used in XPath to AST mapper. The interface has the method which is called [getRoot](http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/javadoc/net/sf/saxon/om/NodeInfo.html#getRoot()) which should return the root node of the DOM tree. In order to implement the mapper properly we need to have one-to-one correspondence of the DOM tree which will be specified by XPath with AST tree. As AST tree does not have the root node, it will be a problem to refer to the root of the AST tree from Xpath.","closed","antlr,","MEZk","2017-06-03T21:15:40Z","2019-03-12T19:40:37Z"

Engineers hate javadoc writing, so it will force them to think about more functional test, and it is ease to catch in codereview. Meanwhile let update code that is easy to update and keep mocks in complicated cases only with explanation like ""argument is Class type, that is final , no way to easily mock it so we use powermock"".  We should document all mocks why they can't be normal tests. If the test can be converted to a non-mock easily, we should try and do this. We need to demand in new code that we limit what can be mocks.","open","approved,","rnveach","2017-08-19T13:41:53Z","2017-08-22T15:16:39Z"

"","4003","Indentation UTs should not use ROOT locale when they test violation/error message","taken from https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/3993#discussion_r105829337  The `IndentationCheckTest` is quite different from other tests. There are many `verifyWarns` in test methods. The actual assertion of `verifyWarns` is at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/indentation/IndentationCheckTest.java#L1785-L1786, that to use an `endsWith` but not `equals` to judge the correctness.  The `getExpectedMessage()` is defined here, https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/indentation/IndentationCheckTest.java#L1818-L1827 And the error message in English could be one of the followings: ``` indentation.error.multi=''{0}'' have incorrect indentation level {1}, expected level should be one of the following: {2}. indentation.child.error.multi=''{0}'' child have incorrect indentation level {1}, expected level should be one of the following: {2}. indentation.error=''{0}'' have incorrect indentation level {1}, expected level should be {2}. indentation.child.error=''{0}'' child have incorrect indentation level {1}, expected level should be {2}. ``` The `endWith` way could work when the message is in English or Chinese. But in many other languages, it will not work at all. The messages could have different postfixes due to the difference of singular-plural or even pronounce stress. i.e. in Finnish ``` indentation.error.multi=''{0}'' on virheellinen sisennystason {1}, odottaa tasolla pitäisi olla yksi seuraavista: {2}. indentation.child.error.multi=''{0}'' lapsi on väärä sisennystason {1}, odottaa tasolla pitäisi olla yksi seuraavista: {2}. indentation.error={0} sisennyssyvyydellä {1} ei ole oikealla syvyydellä {2}. indentation.child.error=''{0}'' lapsi on väärä sisennystason {1}, odottaa taso olisi {2}. ``` We can see the messages have totally different postfixes.  I have logged what information the `IndentComment` really has and found that it doesn't have the token type info at all.  It only has the actual and expected intent. So we can only know that the message is smth like `''{an unknown token type}'' have incorrect indentation level {actual intent}, expected level should be {expected intent}.` I guess it is why the original contributor didn't use `equals` but `endWith`.  To sum up, I haven't found another way to do the assertion without `endWith`. And if we are using `endWith`, it is not able to do the assertion in many non-English languages. Therefore, I use the old/ugly way to enforce the locale in English.","closed","medium,","romani","2017-03-14T18:19:44Z","2017-03-19T13:43:48Z"

When reading code using such a method, it can be difficult to decipher what the boolean stands for without looking at the source or documentation. This problem is also known as the ""boolean trap"". The boolean parameter can often be profitably replaced with an enum  Use the option below to only warn when a method contains more than one boolean parameter. ` link for ""boolean trap"" - https://ariya.io/2011/08/hall-of-api-shame-boolean-trap  It will be good to update but do this accurately to not damage CI that depends on maven plugin that uses such c-tors.

"","4714","Make SuppressionCommentFilter and SuppressWithNearbyCommentFilter children of TreeWalker","SuppressWithNearbyCommentFilter and SuppressionCommentFilter need to have information which can be extracted from AST. TreeWalker is the only one FileSetCheck which deals with AST. That is why it is reasonable to make both filters children of TreeWalker. AST must not be visible on the Checker level.  What should be done:  1. Create TreeWalkerAuditEvent. TreeWalkerAuditEvent is a wrapper class with the following set of fields: ```java private String fileName; private FileContents fileContents; private LocalizedMessage localizedMessage; ``` We should not extend AuditEvent or create AbstractAuditEvent as we cannot design the whole model of events now. Thus, the concrete implementation is OK.  2. Create AstFilter interface with the following api: ```java boolean accept(TreeWalkerAuditEvent auditEvent); ```   3. SuppressionCommentFilter and SuppressWithNearbyCommentFilter should implement AstFilter. Dependency on FileContentsHolder must be removed. All UTs should be fixed.  4. Add the set of AstFilters to TreeWalker.  5. All AstFilters should be initialized and configured in ```setupChild``` method of TreeWalker (similar to Checker).  6. Add the sorted set of localized messages to TreeWalker.  7. The set of messages should be cleared in notifyBegin method of TreeWalker.  8. The messages, received from the parents of AbstractCheck should be stored to the sorted set of messages in TreeWalker inside ```notifyEnd``` method.  9. TreeWalker has to filter the set of sorted messages in ```processFiltered```. All messages which pass the filtration should be given to the apper level to Checker (```AbstractFileSetCheck#addMessages```). TreeWalkerAuditEvent objects need to be created based on LocalizedMessage instances.   @timurt  You can use [my branch](https://github.com/MEZk/checkstyle/tree/tree-walker-filter) as a starting point.  ==========================  ATTENTION (config migration process): SuppressWithNearbyCommentFilter - just move config part under TreeWalker (from Checker). SuppressCommentFilter - Unfortunately we caused regression by this fix till 8.6 version for SuppressCommentFilter, upgrade is to use new Filter http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_filters.html#SuppressWithPlainTextCommentFilter - just rename name of module.

In 8.1 the SuppressionCommentFilter was changed to be a TreeWalker child, instead of a Checker child. With this change it seems that it is now no longer possible to suppress non-TreeWalker warnings in Java files. Specifically, I have quite some RegexpMultiline checks for our code base, for which some locations are disabled through Checkstyle suppression instructions in Java comments.  As an example, consider the following part of a Java file: ```java 	public static void safeShutdown(@CheckForNull ExecutorService executor, 			Duration gracefulTimeout, Duration interruptTimeout, String executorServiceIdentifier) { 			// ... 			// CHECKSTYLE:OFF:RegexpMultiline 			executor.shutdownNow(); 			// CHECKSTYLE:ON:RegexpMultiline 			// ... 	} ```  I'm using the following Checkstyle configuration (this is a very small excerpt, but includes the supression and multiline modules in question.  ```xml    	 	 		 			 			 			 		 	 	 		 		 		 	  ```  When running this through Checkstyle 8.1 (from Gradle) I now get: ``` [ant:checkstyle] [WARN] X:\dev\projects\toolkit\common-core\src\main\java\nl\forcare\concurrent\DelegatingExecutorService.java:84: Don't use executor.shutdownNow() without awaitTermination. ExecutorUtil.safeShutdown() is usually your best bet.

ExecutorUtil.safeShutdown() is usually your best bet. [RegexpMultiline] ```  ---------------  Is there still a way to suppress the RegexpMultiline warnings through comments in the Java files. I am aware that I could rewrite all these locations (hundreds) such that the suppressions become part of the supressions XML file filter, but I'd rather keep using the comments, as they are nice and local in the code and clearly show at that location that we explicitly disable the rule.  Note: although I do not want to prescribe the solution, it would be useful if there would be some generic form of text-file line suppression filter. I could then run Checkstyle over any type of text file (Javascript, Markdown, etc.) and use a certain form of comment in all these files to disable the generic RegexpSingleline module.","closed","approved,","Ricq","2017-08-02T12:37:30Z","2018-01-30T22:23:38Z"

"","4996","RedundantModifier flags public constructor of private inner class although used in reflective construction","Probably related to issue #2508. We recently migrated from Checkstyle 5 to 8.1, which caused RedundantModifier to start flagging public constructors of non-public and non-protected inner classes. While this is true for compiled code, it is not for code that uses reflection to create instances of such classes.  E.g. the following example will compile, but not run  ```java public class ReflectionConstructorWithoutAccessModifier {     public static void main(String[] args) throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException, NoSuchMethodException, SecurityException {         SomeClass someObject = SomeClass.class.getConstructor().newInstance();     }      private static class SomeClass {         SomeClass() {         }     } } ```  While making the SomeClass constructor public will make the code run, but will also make Checkstyle flag the constructor as having a redundant public keyword.  Although I understand that issue #2508 has been closed with the rationale that these corner cases cannot be covered by Checkstyle, this is a slightly different case not related to serialization. Still I can live with disabling checkstyle warnings for the very few situations where we have the above code.","closed","","Tohnmeister","2017-08-24T13:41:30Z","2017-08-24T23:46:04Z"

Example:  ```                              ```  > In this example we can see if we could not find suitable allow/disallow inside `subpackage name=""imports""` then we go to the parent.

"","4974","Issue #4842: make test for creating listener with location clean temp file","Issue #4842   MainTest.testCreateListenerWithLocationIllegalStateException tests method Main.createListener. This method opens output stream for specified output location and passes created output stream to appropriate audit listener constructor. When specified format of the audit listener is not appropriate  it closes the stream with CommonUtils.close and throws exception.  Test MainTest.testCreateListenerWithLocationIllegalStateException mocks CommonUtils.close and in the result the output stream is not closed after invocation of Main.createListener.  At the end of the test it tried to remove the output location for which the output stream was not closed. In Windows the file cannot be deleted where there is stream opened for file. The attempt to do this leads to the following error:  ``` java.nio.file.FileSystemException: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process ```  This exception was silenced because the deletion of the file was done with FileUtils.deleteQuietly. In Unix-like system you can remove file even when there is stream opened for this file.  The most basic test reproducing this behaviour is the following:  ```java     @Test     public void test() throws Exception {         String path = ""myfolder1234"";         FileOutputStream file = new FileOutputStream(path);         Files.delete(new File(path).toPath());     } ```  In Windows this throws java.nio.file.FileSystemException exception, in FreeBSD 11.0 the file is removed as expected.  To delete output location in Windows the output stream must be closed before file is deleted. It is done by intercepting argument passed to CommonUtils.close and closing this stream manually. In Unix-like systems this should not harm the test.","closed","","liscju","2017-08-19T23:20:40Z","2017-08-26T15:27:09Z"

I added a temporary junit method to verify version numbers from extract file matched what I wrote in the xdocs. I manually confirmed versions 3.0 and 6.7 because of limitations of the extract utility and small issues in CS at those times.

They cannot coexist, one of them fails when I try to fix another.","closed","","Nimfadora","2017-07-08T13:15:46Z","2017-07-09T04:44:47Z"

This would help user to exactly identify and process a javadoc node which is an unclosed tag in the way he/she wants to.

I wrote a custom listener and expanded what communications it receives to gather and print metrics on it's execution time and number of times areas were called to produce reports and examine slow down areas, like modules and javadoc. You have seen these reports before. FileSets and Checks cannot receive the detailed information that a listener can as it is the most global thing we have in Checkstyle.  This is my branch: https://github.com/rnveach/checkstyle/commits/more_audits  I also have a private listener which is basically an implementation of #3242 , where on auditFinished it examines the list of defined suppressions and prints violations on any that were not used. I have to use a listener as it is the only customizable area that is called at the end once all other modules, filters, and such are done.

"","4916","Try to load class from all of packages as classpath scanning doesn't work in Eclipse runtime environment","I am the maintainer of the Checkstyle Eclipse plugin (http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/). This is a followup to #4885,  indeed the error message was misleading.  After some in-depth debugging I came to the conclusion that the classpath scanning, introduced with #3607 just does not work in more complex classloading environments such as Eclipse - which is an OSGi runtime platform. Eclipse/OSGI requires all functionality to be provided as OSGi bundle/plugin. Classloading for each bundle is isolated by specialized bundle classloaders which encapsulate which classes a plugin/bundle ""sees"". This requires both Checkstyle core and potential Checkstyle extension to be provided as plugin/bundle.  The classpath scanning uses the [Classpath](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/17.0/api/docs/com/google/common/reflect/ClassPath.html) facility from Guava, where documentation clearly states that it only supports URLClassloaders. However OSGi bundle classloading is not based on URLClassloaders, thus the classpath scanning is not able to find any custom checks in Checkstyle extensions. Checkstyle core still works because of hardwired lookup tables maintained in code.  Would you be open to discuss the current approach and a potential return the the ""old brute-force"" extension classloading?","closed","new feature,","lkoe","2017-08-08T21:01:39Z","2017-12-20T15:47:47Z"

"","4364","Design a new format of suppression dtd schema to support XPath queries","From my and @timurt point of view, XPath for queering AST nodes will be a good idea for the new suppression model, because: 1. XPath can be used for queering AST tree nodes in a simple and transparent way; 2. There are two ready to use open-source libraries which allow to work with XPath to query AST nodes easily (Jaxen and Saxon). Both libraries are used by PMD, so we can adopt their experience. No need to reinvent the wheel; 3. XPath is a good solution for xml-format as other tools such as PMD and Sonarqube already support it, and it will be easy for the programmer to write suppression rules for the Checkstyle’s violations if the format of the suppressions will be similar. 4. User who is already familiar with AST tokens we use in the checks, can have the base understanding of tree structure which will help him to write XPath expression.   Based on the arguments, mentioned above, we decided that we need to use XPath in the new model.  **What should be done in the scope of this issue:** 1. The decision on whether to extend [the existing dtd schema](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/suppressions_1_1.dtd) or create a new one specially for the new suppression model should be made; 2. In case we decide that we need to extend the existing schema, the new format of the suppression element need to be proposed, otherwise the new format of dtd schema should be introduced.  My proposal: 1. We need to extend the existing dtd schema to avoid breaking of backward compatibility. When we introduce the new suppression model nobody should notice the problem. The projects which use the old line-based approach should have an ability to continue suppressing Checkstyle violations by lines. 2. In his [GSoC 2017 proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwQmXRY7FQoXB4icdnstnOOc8aloJSiLKDXfEWBGHbk/edit#heading=h.8hhjmh38bbo2) @timurt suggested adding a new attribute for the existing suppression element:  ```xml  ```  I think that this is a good idea, but from my point of view, "" xpath""="""" would="""" be="""" a="""" better="""" name="""" for="""" the="""" attribute.="""" such="""" approach="""" will="""" allow="""" us="""" to="""" support="""" two="""" models="""" in="""" same="""" file.="""" user="""" not="""" need="""" rewrite="""" whole="""" suppression="""" file="""" from="""" scratch.="""" other="""" solution="""" is="""" add="""" new="""" attribute="""" existing="""" ""suppress""="""" element:="""" ```xml=""""  ```  In the second approach the influence on dtd schema will be minimal.  **Warning** In this issue we do not discuss all details of the implementation. We just discuss the new format of the dtd schema which will be a user-friendly and will not break backward compatibility.                  closedmiscellaneous,                 MEZk                2017-05-20T07:49:04Z               2017-06-18T15:44:21Z                                             4363               add vavr library to our regression testing               repo: https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr It use very functional style of java.

Adding '\n' is a better and more realistic option than modifying the predicate for `PACKAGE` token because in a java file `@see` tag can never be followed by EOF. See also: [4671#discussion](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/4671#discussion_r126317734)_  **UPDATE:** The javadoc parser is separately fed the content that resides between `/**` and `*/` and hence EOF is possible inside javadoc. This detail was somehow overlooked by me. `_input.LA(1) == EOF` has been added to the predicate for `PACKAGE` token.               closed                voidfist                2017-07-18T04:35:28Z               2017-08-01T16:58:56Z                                             4752               Parsing @see tag with no double quotes to mark string               $ cat YOUR_FILE.java  ``` * @see https://www.something.com ```  $ java -jar checkstyle-8.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -j  test.java  ``` JAVADOC -> JAVADOC [0:0] |--LEADING_ASTERISK -> * [0:0] |--WS ->   [0:1] |--JAVADOC_TAG -> JAVADOC_TAG [0:2] |   |--SEE_LITERAL -> @see [0:2] |   |--WS ->   [0:6] |   |--REFERENCE -> REFERENCE [0:7] |   |   `--PACKAGE -> https [0:7] |   `--DESCRIPTION -> DESCRIPTION [0:13] |       `--TEXT -> ://www.something.com [0:13] `--EOF ->  [0:33] ```  As can be seen the javadoc tree is wrong and url should be recognized as string. This happens becuase `WS` is not enforced before description in `@see` tag and because `PACKAGE` token is being [produced by lexer without any context](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L123). Such input would also lead javadoc tool to produce errors since the quotes are missing. But still the javadoc tool would render the site with a string placed for the url.  Changing [JavadocParser.g4#L881](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocParser.g4#L881) from:  ```  | SEE_LITERAL (WS | NEWLINE)* reference? (STRING | htmlElement)* (WS | NEWLINE)* description? ```  to:  ``` | SEE_LITERAL (WS | NEWLINE)* reference? ((WS | NEWLINE)+ STRING | htmlElement)* (WS | NEWLINE)* ((WS | NEWLINE)+ description)? ```  results in the following output for the same input file:  ``` Exception in thread "" main""="""" java.lang.illegalargumentexception:="""" [error:0]="""" javadoc="""" comment="""" at="""" column="""" -3="""" has="""" parse="""" error.="""" unrecognized="""" error="""" from="""" antlr="""" parser:="""" null="""" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.detailnodetreestringprinter.parsejavadocasdetailnode(detailnodetreestringprinter.java:71)="""" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.detailnodetreestringprinter.parsejavadocasdetailnode(detailnodetreestringprinter.java:83)="""" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.detailnodetreestringprinter.parsefile(detailnodetreestringprinter.java:173)="""" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.detailnodetreestringprinter.printfileast(detailnodetreestringprinter.java:59)="""" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.main.runcli(main.java:400)="""" com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.main.main(main.java:209)="""" ```="""" which="""" happens="""" since="""" parser="""" no="""" place="""" to="""" fit="""" `:`="""" in="""" [reference="""" rule](https:="""" github.com="""" checkstyle="""" blob="""" master="""" src="""" main="""" resources="""" com="""" puppycrawl="""" tools="""" grammars="""" javadocparser.g4#l864),="""" **already**="""" recognized="""" as="""" `char`="""" by="""" lexer,="""" follows="""" `https`="""" been="""" `package`="""" lexer="""" and="""" hence="""" token="""" should="""" be="""" identified="""" with="""" proper="""" discretion.="""" _(reference="""" rule="""" is="""" called="""" spotted="""" the="""" parser)_="""" see="""" also:="""" [4550#issuecomment](https:="""" pull="""" 4550#issuecomment-312521474)="""" ,="""" 4550#issuecomment-312529807)","closed","","voidfist","2017-07-18T03:15:37Z","2017-08-21T14:57:18Z"

Order of filter elements don't matter anywhere else, which would only be FilterSet which also has an equals/hashcode.  SuppressionFilter should be updated to not have equals in hashCode. SuppressFilterElement should be updated to reference that it is immutable and keep both methods.

New configuration will maintain small number of checks on checkstyle's resources. Right now it is being configured with `NewlineAtEndOfFileCheck`.  I would like to propose we add the following checks to the resource: `OuterTypeFilenameCheck` - main class in input should be named after file `PackageDeclarationCheck` - package name should be same as folder location  Other ideas for checks against resources as they can cause some confusion with new contributors as we disallow them in main configuration: remove trailing spaces. remove tabs.","closed","easy,","rnveach","2017-03-25T19:20:36Z","2018-06-16T23:10:46Z"

The log method of AbstractCheck has a special hack to avoid confusion in the Checkstyle output:  ```java final int col = 1 + CommonUtils.lengthExpandedTabs(             getLines()[lineNo - 1], colNo, tabWidth); ```  We always increment column number at list by 1. Tab expansion is another story, and it is OK. That is why we need to consider that the first character starts on the 1st position too.  The fix will lead too the big regression.   1) We need to remove ```-1``` from DetailAST 2) We need to remove ```+1``` from AbstractCheck#log 3) We should fix all UTs. Special attention to each failing UT, some checks violations may become confusing. 4) The regression report for all failing checks has to be generated to prove that at least the number of violations will not be decreased.

If someone very definitely wanted a certain EOL type, then surely they need a (new?) check which confirms all EOLs throughout all files are using that EOL type, not merely the EOLs at EOF as done by `NewlineAtEndOfFile`.

Based on the [documentation](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/annotation/AnnotationUseStyleCheck.java#L110), I'd expect:     * `EXPANDED` to also complain about line 20.     * `COMPACT_NO_ARRAY` to also complain about lines 20 and 26.      The false negative of `EXPANDED` can perhaps be fixed by simply updating the documentation, but the false negatives for `COMPACT_NO_ARRAY` seem to require genuine code changes.  2. But at the same time I think the `elementStyle` property seems to be concerned with two orthogonal aspects that should be split up:     * A property `compact = {ALWAYS, NEVER, IGNORE}` using which to control whether `value` must (not) be omitted when possible.     * A property `singleArrayCurlies = {ALWAYS, NEVER, IGNORE}` using which to control whether single-value array values must (not) be surrounded by curly braces. (I guess `ALWAYS` requires introspection of the annotation definition and is therefore out-of-scope for Checkstyle?)      This way the styling of the `attr2` attribute in the example above can be controlled as well; right now `AnnotationUseStyleCheck` doesn't enforce the use of curlies for this attribute at all.

We should take into account that the guide says that the rule is applicable only to static **nested** classes.   **Should be taken into account during the implementation** To determine that there is an import of static nested class we can analyze import statement to find out whether it includes supposed nested class name.  For example, say we have the class MyClass which contains static nested class MyStaticNestedClass:  ```java package nested;  public class MyClass {     public static class MyStaticNestedClass {         public static void foo() {         }     } ```  Lets assume, that class MyTestClass imports static nested class MyStaticNestedClass:  ```java package main;  import static nested.MyClass.MyStaticNestedClass; // violation  public class Main {     public static void main(String[] args) {         MyStaticNestedClass.foo();     } } ```  We can check the import statement and extract the information about nested class. However, not only static nested classes can be imported this way, but also interfaces and enums. It means that we cannot say for sure that there is an import of static nested class.   **Option name and configuration** Option name: checkOnlyNestedClasses. Default value: false (to avoid breaking of backward compatibility).","closed","easy,","MEZk","2017-03-14T19:54:51Z","2017-03-19T00:19:54Z"

"","4543","Cannot test Checkstyle on Windows (Cygwin or WSL)","As discussed in https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/4463#issuecomment-310078623 I'm not able to get Checkstyle's tests to pass on Windows. I've tried in both Cygwin and [WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl) but run into a number of failures. I imagine they're issues with my system, given that the Windows CI is passing, but filing a separate issue seemed like a better option than having this discussion on the original pull request.  The full logs of `mvn -X test` are here: https://gist.github.com/dimo414/fbb7569970e9a2192d266e956d1f0a55  On Cygwin I see several failures related to AST parsing, such as:  ``` [ERROR] testParseFile(com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.AstTreeStringPrinterTest)  Time elapsed: 0.002 s  <<< FAILURE! org.junit.ComparisonFailure: Generated AST from Java file should match pre-defined AST expected:<...DEF -> package [1:0][ |--ANNOTATIONS -> ANNOTATIONS [1:28] |--DOT -> .

"","4391","Add a configurable timeout parameter to checkstyle","As a stopgap solution for #4390, and a potentially generally useful addition, would it be possible to add some kind of timeout controls to checkstyle, so that users could specify how long they were willing to wait for results? I don't much care whether it's done via command line flag(s) or configuration file properties; whichever is preferable to the checkstyle maintainers & developers is fine.  I see four potential granularities of control: total time for all the tests on all the code, total time for all the tests on a single file, total time for a particular test on all files, and total time for an individual test on an individual file.  This definitely interacts with the other issues I've seen planning on multithreaded support, and indeed might not even be easily doable without that infrastructure.","closed","","blerner","2017-05-30T23:03:23Z","2017-06-01T02:43:54Z"

[ERROR] TestClass.java:9:27: '}' at column 27 should have line break before. [RightCurly] Audit done. Checkstyle ends with 1 errors. ````  As example shows, there is no consistency in how brace should be validated. Should it require `\n}`, `}\n`, or allowed to be all single line? As it stands now, our own checkstyle config will allow in bad examples if we don't see them first. IMO, `RightCurlyCheck` should control every aspect of the curlies placement.  I propose we split `option` into 2 properties to control the placement before and after the `}`. I propose the names `beforeOption` and `afterOption`. `beforeOption` will have the values `alone` and `singleline`. `afterOption` will have the values `alone` and `same`. I don't think `beforeOption` needs `same` as I can't imagine anyone writing like that. All my examples use `if` and `if-else` to show single block, multiple-blocks, and demonstrate behavior of conditional-multiblocks. Examples can apply to any other token like `try`/`catch`, etc.  `alone` means `\n` should come before or after curly. 'after' is only considered if it has a multi-block statement after it as documented further down. `if (condition) { }` violation for alone before `if (condition) { \n}` ok for alone before `if (condition) { \n test(); }` violation for alone before `if (condition) { } else {` violation for alone after `if (condition) { } \n else {` ok for alone after  `same` means `\n` should not come after curly. 'after' is only considered if it has a multi-block statement after it as documented further down. `if (condition) { }` ok for same after `if (condition) { } else {` ok for same after `if (condition) { } \n else {` violation for same after  `singleline` means `\n` should not come before the right curly unless it is not on the same line as the left curly. If it is not on the same line, it will behave as `alone`. `if (condition) { }` ok for singleline `if (condition) { \n}` ok for singleline `if (condition) { \n test(); }` violation for singleline  For `afterOption`, it is connected to the next multi-block statement (Ex: `else` of `if`, `catch` of `try`). If there is no next multi-block statement (`if` with no `else`) and no continuation of the current statement, it will specifically default to `alone` and allow nothing after it. `beforeOption` has no connection to what comes before it except for `singleline` option as described above. Examples: `if (condition) { } int i = 5;` 1 violation using any value of `afterOption`. `if (condition) { }\n` ok with any value of `afterOption`. `if (condition) { } else {` 1 violations with `alone` on `afterOption`. ok with `same`. `if (condition) { }\n else {` 1 violations with `same` on `afterOption`. ok with `alone`. ````     Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {     }); // violation on 'alone' on 'afterOption', ok on 'same'. This is considered ""continuation of the current statement"". ````  I finally propose that any changes we make to `RightCurlyCheck` should be mirrored in `LeftCurlyCheck`. This part could be done in a separate issue. I am just mentioning it so we don't forget.","open","","rnveach","2017-03-23T02:05:15Z","2018-06-26T01:10:11Z"

As the [documentation says](http://www.antlr.org/api/Java/org/antlr/v4/runtime/ANTLRInputStream.html#seek(int)):  > consume() ahead until p==index; can't just set p=index as we must update line and charPositionInLine. If we seek backwards, just set [p](http://www.antlr.org/api/Java/org/antlr/v4/runtime/ANTLRInputStream.html#p)  And you can see here what documentation means by it as `seek` just sets `p` which can be seen here in [ANTLRInputStream.java#L192-#L202](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/runtime/Java/src/org/antlr/v4/runtime/ANTLRInputStream.java#L192-#L202)  The following javadoc trees help exhibit this bug  $ cat test.javadoc ``` *@see A://www.something.com ```  $ java -jar checkstyle-8.1-SNAPSHOT-all-master.jar -j test.javadoc  ``` JAVADOC -> JAVADOC [0:0] |--LEADING_ASTERISK -> * [0:0] |--JAVADOC_TAG -> JAVADOC_TAG [0:1] |   |--SEE_LITERAL -> @see [0:1] |   |--WS ->   [0:5] |   |--REFERENCE -> REFERENCE **[0:6]** |   |   `--CLASS -> A **[0:6]** |   `--DESCRIPTION -> DESCRIPTION **[0:8]** |       `--TEXT -> ://www.something.com **[0:8]** `--EOF ->  [0:28] ```  $ cat test2.javadoc ``` *@see a://www.something.com ```  $ java -jar checkstyle-8.1-SNAPSHOT-all-master.jar -j test2.javadoc ``` JAVADOC -> JAVADOC [0:0] |--LEADING_ASTERISK -> * [0:0] |--JAVADOC_TAG -> JAVADOC_TAG [0:1] |   |--SEE_LITERAL -> @see [0:1] |   |--WS ->   [0:5] |   `--DESCRIPTION -> DESCRIPTION **[0:7]** |       `--TEXT -> a://www.something.com **[0:7]** `--EOF ->  [0:28] ```  In `JavadocLexer`'s  `seeLink` mode when `CHAR` is encountered, a call to `skipCurrentTokenConsuming` is made at [JavadocLexer.g4#L138](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L138). This results in `charPositionInLine` to increase by 1 which is not corrected for either by method `seek` or by method `skipCurrentTokenConsuming`.   This behaviour can be seen when `a` in `a://www.something.com` is treated as `CHAR` and in the resultant javadoc tree the Column Number for `DESCRIPTION` is `7` even though it is at the same position as `A`, which is recognized as `CLASS` and is at `column 6`, in `A://www.something.com`.  This behavior can also be observed in just tree 1 in which `DESCRIPTION` should start at `column 7` but starts at `column 8` rather.  Either we should specify this bug in doc or try to extend `ANTLRInputStream` and override the call to `seek` and correct it somehow.","open","antlr-javadoc,","voidfist","2017-07-25T14:47:36Z","2021-08-12T15:57:47Z"

"","4390","Javadoc comments containing unescaped Java code with generic types leads to enormous parsing times","(Split off from #3332 as requested)  The following code leads to enormous parsing times.  It is derived from an actual student-written homework, where the student had commented out a `@Test` method because it wasn't working...but used `/** ... **/` instead of `/* ... */`.  Since we use checkstyle as a component of our auto-grading setup, we need the checks to run automatically and quickly (and not DDoS other students by tying up the server resources). ```java class DontCare { /**   @Test   public void someTestMethod() {     List x = makeAList();     List x = makeAList();     ...add more copies of this line to make the runtime worse...     feefiefoefum     feefiefoefum     ...and add more copies of this line, too.   } **/ } ``` The problem stems from the Javadoc parser seeing `` and thinking it's an HTML tag, rather than Java code (because it's not marked off by `{@code ... }`), and therefore looking for the matching close tag.  My hunch is there's something in the parser that's forcing a backtracking search, rather than a more efficient table-driven search, and triggering pathological ANTLR behavior.  As far as I can tell: * You need at least two `List` lines before the parser performance chokes. * With ~20 lines of ""feefiefoefum"", each additional `List` line adds ~2 seconds to the parse time. * With more lines of ""feefiefoefum"", the runtime grows accordingly. * With more `List` lines, the runtime seems to grow superlinearly, though I couldn't tell exactly how badly. * If I replace every `List` with `List?Foo?`, so that the text is identical in length but contains nothing that looks like unclosed HTML tags, the runtime is ~ 1sec (including the startup time of my surrounding application, so, basically instantly). * Interleaving `List` lines with `List?Foo?` lines doesn't much seem to matter: it seems like runtime is growing as a function of the number of `List` lines and the total length of the comment, not the position of the what-appear-to-be-unclosed-tags within the comment.  Per https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3332#issuecomment-302589230, this might be related to #3727 -- but unlike that issue, which tried running Javadoc checkstyle rules on a purely .java file and so could be plausibly ruled out as user error, this one is asking to run Javadoc checkstyle rules on a Java file that happens to have a Javadoc comment with egregiously weird contents.  (I'm happy to call this one student error, too...but it's student error that means I can't use checkstyle any more.)","closed","antlr,","blerner","2017-05-30T16:03:34Z","2017-08-21T13:16:19Z"

This behaviour repeats with `*7.6.2-SNAPSHOT-all.jar` too. So it's not something due to any recent changes.  This issue should relate to #4824  and the fact that there is no recognition for `NEWLINE` in the corresponding Lexer modes.  All the lexer modes with no `NEWLINE` should display the same behaviour. One easy fix would be to introduce `NEWLINE` in those lexer modes.","open","antlr-javadoc,","voidfist","2017-08-21T22:12:21Z","2020-01-21T01:39:29Z"

This happens becuase once [`referenceCatched`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L123) is set true, it is set false only after a certain kind of token is encountered in certain modes. But when [`XmlTagOpen1`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L121) token is encountered while parsing, ANTLR pushes into [`mode xmlTagDefinition`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L273) and after that when [`CLOSE` or `SQUASH_CLOSE`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L275-#L276) is encountered ANTLR pushes into `DEFAULT_MODE` from where it keeps switching back and forth between modes `xmlTagDefinition` and `DEFAULT_MODE` until another javadoc tag is encountered. Nowhere the variable `referenceCatched` gets set back to `false`.  So, in the above example when second `@see` is encountered and ANTLR pushes into [`mode seeLink`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L103), `referenceCatched` is already true and ANTLR pushes the lexer back into DEFAULT_MODE as soon as [`WS`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L104) is encountered which results in `Up.Lo#member` being recognized as plain text.   Adding `refrenceCatched = false` in overridden [`emit`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammars/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L22) method solves this.","closed","","voidfist","2017-07-02T20:25:53Z","2017-07-02T23:42:09Z"

I guess the reason is we have some classes that have the same simple name in both checkstyle project and sevntu.checkstyle project.  We could see `HideUtilityClassConstructorCheck` in the log,  and there are https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/blob/master/sevntu-checks/src/main/java/com/github/sevntu/checkstyle/checks/design/HideUtilityClassConstructorCheck.java and https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/design/HideUtilityClassConstructorCheck.java.  I am not sure which class should I use here. More specifically, to use checkstyle's HideUtilityClassConstructorCheck or sevntu.checkstyle's HideUtilityClassConstructorCheck? (same question with other classes with same name) Currently I just choose the new one in the stream.  I don't know how to reproduce the bug in IDE currently. So I was not able to use a debug mode to check the `packages` field when the bug occurs.","closed","","Luolc","2017-05-29T12:20:48Z","2017-06-28T14:16:39Z"

The main idea is to check whether there is an import of a class or there is an import of other static member. Now we check both.  Google Java Style Guide coverage page was updated. I added a link to the issue. @romani, a link to 3.3.4 section should be updated to reference updated cached Google Java Style Guide.  3) > 14 Section 4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be concise requires new examples in IT area.  Added. Examples were taken from Google Java Style Guide.  4) > 15 This change will require the implementation of the logic which will process lambdas for NoLineWrapCheck or OperatorWrap. Now they do not treat lambdas.  Google Java Style Guide coverage page was updated. I added a link to the issue.  5) > 16 This says that any line break may (but not must) be preceded by arbitrary whitespace followed by an implementation comment. So it is not mandatory.  google_checks.xml does not include a config for TrailingComments. EmptyBlock and EmptyCatch will treat the blocks of code which have a trailing comments as non-empty. Thus, there is no need in updating the config.  Updated Google Java Style Guide coverage page: http://mezk.github.io/i3755-google-style-guide/site/google_style.html  @romani  All links which now reference Google Java Style Guide (2016-07-12) should be changed after you cache the updated guide.","closed","","MEZk","2017-03-18T21:47:26Z","2017-03-26T17:57:23Z"
