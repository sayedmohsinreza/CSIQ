Formerly, there was a ""pseudo cause"" exception in the `SAXException`:  http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/jdk/internal/org/xml/sax/SAXException.java#l95 ```     public SAXException (Exception e)     {         super();         this.exception = e;     } ```  Now it is a regular exception as it should be: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.xml/share/classes/org/xml/sax/SAXException.java#l99 ```     public SAXException (Exception e)     {         super(e);     } ``` As the result, the exception message is slightly different: before jdk11: `Property ${nonexistent} has not been set` after jdk11: `com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.CheckstyleException: Property ${nonexistent} has not been set`  The exception itself is not changed. It still a `CheckstyleException` wrapped in `SAXException`wrapped in another `CheckstyleException`.  So, the idea is to check the message of the original exception. We don't have to test the jdk. It has already been tested. Instead, we need to make sure that the correct exception is nested inside and check it.","closed","","pbludov","2018-12-23T08:48:49Z","2018-12-23T15:48:54Z"

"","6308","Indentation: indentation level is being corrupted in class fields","While running regression for pitest, I have gotten differences that I couldn't reproduce locally on a single file run. I believe one reason is because the [`IndentLevel`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/641b6b2c0689fc35d6a3d77a7215fd1d9ce2a2b8/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/indentation/AbstractExpressionHandler.java#L49) is being corrupted as we use the same class instance among multiple fields.  [I tried to remove the cache of this field](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/641b6b2c0689fc35d6a3d77a7215fd1d9ce2a2b8/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/indentation/AbstractExpressionHandler.java#L83), but it caused regression to stall for 10 hours on apache ant's `BlockSort.java`.  I rework IndentLevel class to be immutable, and I am seeing regression differences.  From the changes I made, [I believe `ObjectBlockHandler` is the one doing the corruption](https://github.com/rnveach/checkstyle/blob/6893affeac7285afd16f8a389c7d65023d0c327a/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/indentation/ObjectBlockHandler.java#L67-L69).

"","6858","Remove TreeWalker#validateDefaultTokens","While checking source code, I found following method in TreeWalker class -  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/6bab0788365ba9afb713e14d9f6263f1f60b7aa2/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/TreeWalker.java#L277-L293  Looks like this was added as a part of #655  The thing is that this method validates that check's required tokens are subset of default tokens. But this validation is performed on startup of checkstyle and not related with user configuration, since both `getDefaultTokens` and `getRequiredTokens` are hardcoded in the check.  So, if some check, for some reason, violates this requirement, there is no way to launch this check because checkstyle will always fail on startup. Moreover, user can do nothing about it (except removing this check from their config) and this check is useless.  I don't see a reason for such validation on startup, this can be performed by unit tests to forbid such check. As a nice bonus, startup will be a bit faster.","closed","miscellaneous,","strkkk","2019-06-27T13:19:52Z","2019-07-09T04:25:53Z"

The proposal is to add a property `violateImpliedFinalOnMethodWhenClassFinal` to `ClassMemberImpliedModifier`. The property would ensure that methods are declared `final` on `final` classes.  The reason for descoping is that it requires design consideration to determine what should or should not be checked, particularly with regard to: - methods on enums - static methods (final will prevent the method from being hidden by subclasses) - instance methods.

Annotation `@lombok.Generated` has `IDENT` with `Generated` value, but method was not suppressed as others.  We assumed that node can have only one `IDENT` child node (see [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/xpath/ElementNode.java#L261)), but below you can see example where `DOT` token has two `IDENT` direct child nodes. Current implementation takes first child node with token type `IDENT` for `@text` attribute. For example here `DOT` node will have `lombok` as `@text` attribute value.  ```     |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [2:1]     |   |   |--ANNOTATION -> ANNOTATION [2:1]     |   |   |   |--AT -> @ [2:1]     |   |   |   `--DOT -> .

We can add new attribute to the `IDENT` tokens, for example `@value`. `//ANNOTATION/DOT[@text = 'lombok']/IDENT[0]` -> `//ANNOTATION/DOT/IDENT[@value='lombok']` `//ANNOTATION/DOT[@text = 'lombok']/IDENT[1]` -> `//ANNOTATION/DOT/IDENT[@value='Generated']`  > Joining strings to produce a more reliable @text attribute (that could even allow matching ANNOTATION[@text = '@lombok.Generated'] directly), though I'm not sure if it's truely possible to achieve this approach.  We can concat all `IDENT` child nodes texts into single text. `//ANNOTATION/DOT[@text = 'lombok']` -> `//ANNOTATION/DOT[@text = 'lombok.Generated']`  What do you think?","closed","approved,","timurt","2018-09-13T17:58:36Z","2019-01-08T09:47:26Z"

The PR closely follows the pattern of #5899 so hopefully will be reasonably accurate. Thanks for your consideration.","closed","","jodastephen","2018-08-09T19:28:26Z","2018-12-09T19:45:43Z"

"","6472","Unclear rational in ExplicitInitialization","The rational says  > Rationale: Each instance variable gets initialized twice, to the same value. Java initializes each instance variable to its default value (0 or null) before performing any initialization specified in the code. So in this case, x gets initialized to 0 twice, and bar gets initialized to null twice. So there is a minor inefficiency. This style of coding is a holdover from C/C++ style coding, and it shows that the developer isn't really confident that Java initializes instance variables to default values.  Issues: - `x` is referenced but the example that is referenced is not present - `bar` is referenced but the example that is referenced is not present - `This style of coding is a holdover from C/C++ style coding, and it shows that the developer isn't really confident that Java initializes instance variables to default values.` is very negative and also wrong. I agree that explicit initialization should be left out if default is fine, but there are style guides that say that initialization should always be done explicitly. This is not necessarily a leftover from C/C++ style coding or inconfidence of the developer. The rational to have it is, that it is clear from looking at it to what it is initialized without the need to think about it. This is the same as for example `int x = arr[y++] = y;`. This construct could either be seen as ""wow, this developer knows exactly what the JVM is doing and in which order it evaluates expression parts"", or it can be seen as ""what the fuck, this is unreadable, I need to think 30 minutes about what happens in this statement each time I stumble upon it"". For this example I would prefer not using such a wonky construct that 90% of the developers will not instantly understand correctly even if it would show my excellence in understanding JVM internals.","closed","miscellaneous,","Vampire","2019-02-24T13:24:23Z","2019-03-08T02:32:37Z"

Proposed solution is to push/pop a new `ScopeData` when entering/exiting a `LITERAL_FOR` token, and to mark `FinalVariableCandidate`'s for enhanced for-loop variables as `assigned` upon creation.  Regression report: http://esilkensen.github.io/checkstyle-tester/6377  Elasticsearch example from the Issue description: [#A119](http://esilkensen.github.io/checkstyle-tester/6377/elasticsearch/index.html#A119)  **Example of the exception:** (with my understanding of how it happens)  ``` public void method() {   for (Object o : collection) {     // do nothing   }    Object o;   if (condition) {     o = new String(""foo"");   } else {     o = new String(""bar"");   } } ```  With the existing code, the `o` introduced by the `for` loop is added to the top `method` level `ScopeData` and it does not leave that scope after the `for` loop. Then a second `o` is added to the `ScopeData` at line 6.  When the check exits the closing `}` for the `if`, the current scope has one assigned `o` variable (the `o = new String(""foo"");` and the previous scope has two unassigned `o` variables (`for (Object o` and `Object o;`).  It checks `isSameVariables` between the assigned `o` and each unassigned `o`, which returns `true` in both cases (it only checks that they are contained in the same `method`) and so two calls to `iterator.remove()` are made, throwing an exception.  **Solution:**  With the code in this PR, a `ScopeData` is pushed when the check enters a `for` loop to capture variables introduced by `FOR_INIT`/`FOR_EACH_CLAUSE` -- e.g. the `o` bound by the loop. When the check exits a `for` loop it pops that `ScopeData` because those variables are no longer in scope and can be used again. In the example above, it sees that the `o` bound by the loop was never assigned and logs it as a `final` candidate.  This avoids the IllegalStateException in the example because the `o` bound by the loop is no longer part of the scope when the check is processing the if/else, so there is only a single unassigned `o` to consider.  The other change in this PR is to set `assigned` to `true` when creating a `FinalLocalVariableCandidate` for any variable bound in an enhanced for-loop, because these loops implicitly assign the variable when starting iteration.","closed","","esilkensen","2019-02-11T22:31:12Z","2019-02-15T06:07:57Z"

Here is an example of good and bad javadocs the check should examine: ```` package /** violation */ com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.javadoc.invalidjavadocposition;  /** violation */ import java.lang.String;  /** violation **/ /** valid **/ class InputInvalidJavadocPosition {     /** violation **/     } /* ignore */ class InputInvalidJavadocPosition2 {     /** violation */     /** valid */     int field1;     /** valid */     int[] field2;     /** valid */     public int[] field3;     /** valid */     @Deprecated int field4;      int /** violation */ field20;     int field21 /** violation */;     @Deprecated /** violation */ int field22;      void method1() {}     /** valid */     void method2() {}     /** valid */      T method3() { return null; }     /** valid */     String[] method4() { return null; }      void /** violation */ method20() {}     void method21 /** violation */ () {}     void method22(/** violation */) {}     void method23() /** violation */ {}     void method24() { /** violation */ }     void method25() { /** violation */ int variable; } } @Deprecated /** violation */ class InputInvalidJavadocPosition3 {} class /** violation */ InputInvalidJavadocPosition4 {} class InputInvalidJavadocPosition5 /** violation */ {} /** violation */ ````  If a bad Javadoc is found, it should either be moved to the correct position, removed, or turned into a normal block comment.","closed","new module,","rnveach","2019-04-08T02:07:36Z","2019-06-27T04:14:00Z"

"","6942","CLI: support sequential execution of multiple configs","Originally was reported and discussed at #991 .  Example: `java com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Main -c /google_checks.xml -c /custom_checks.xml my-source-folder/`  It is useful if we want to add our own custom checks to be run alonside a standard one, like google's. The current way around this would be to copy the google xml and append new checks to the end of it, but then we would be required to do this for every project. The configurations in jar are there so we don't have to keep reproducing it. If the original google xml should be updated, this would require users to update the custom xml, along with the jar.  There are also other times where I can't put all my checks in the same file because of the ""RegexpSingleline"" module where I want to run different regular expressions on different file types. Having them all in the same configuration on all file types will produce incorrect errors because some checks are only made for one type, and it is allowed in another. I could run checker twice with the different configurations, but that is extra work and time going through the directory tree multiple times.  Chaining of configs is reasonable also but probably it is better to implement it in application/plugins(cli, ant, maven, eclipse). As in Checkstyle we have all under Checker module, so all parsed/loaded files are under its instance. Second config will mean separate Checker instance, so nothing will be shared. CLI will be responsible reuse files-scanning is used defined target as folder. Nothing else should be shared, between executions.

"","6772","Add ParameterNumber.ignoreAnnotations property","My company uses [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for JSON serialization/deserialization of value classes.  We normally use `@JsonCreator` on constructors to support automatic deserialization.  ```java @Immutable class Thing {     private final int id;     private final String name;       @JsonCreator     public Thing(@JsonProperty(""id"") int id,                   @JsonProperty(""name"") String name) {         this.id = id;         this.name = name;     } } ```  Sometimes beans get large (lots of properties), so we have ParameterNumber configured to ignore constructors using:  ```xml  ```  However, sometimes we need to do more validation when deserializing JSON than we do when constructing directly. In these cases, we put @JsonCreator on a factory method that calls the simpler constructor.  ```java     public Thing(int id, String name) {         this.id = id;         this.name = Preconditions.checkNotNull(name, ""'name' is required"");     }      @JsonCreator     private static Thing fromJson(@JsonProperty(""id"") int id,                                    @JsonProperty(""name"") String name) {         Preconditions.checkArgument(id > 0, ""'id' must be positive"");         Preconditions.checkArgument(!name.isEmpty(), ""'name' cannot be empty"");         Preconditions.checkArgument(isValidName(name),                                     ""'name' must consist of only letters and digits"");         // ...         return new Thing(id, name);     } ```  Note that the @JsonCreator factory method has the same argument list as the constructor, so we can’t just define another constructor (unless we play with argument order, which could be confusing).  If the number of properties is too large, we have a checkstyle violation. We’d like to be able to configure checkstyle to ignore methods (and constructors) annotated with `@JsonCreator`, much like how `ignoreOverrides` ignores methods annotated with `@Override` (#66).  I’d suggest generalizing by accepting an annotation list (a String Set like `IllegalImport`’s `illegalClasses` property). Maybe it could be called `ignoreAnnotations` or `excludeAnnotations`.

"","6480","New check: AvoidDoubleBraceInitialization","Many people consider double-brace initialization as an anti-pattern, for example as it unnecessarily creates subclasses and also might break `equals` checks that most often consider instances to be non-equal if the class is not the same to ensure symmetric behavior of the `equals` method as required by its contract.  I'd like to propose a check that prevents double-brace initialization.  Logic I suggest is, that a finding is added if an `INSTANCE_INIT` token has no siblings besides `LCURLY`, other `INSTANCE_INIT`s, `RCURLY`, `SINGLE_LINE_COMMENT` or `BLOCK_COMMENT_BEGIN` which means, as soon as also some field or method is added, it is not considered double-brace initialization and thus is fine.  **_Check config:_** ```xml  ```  **_Here some code example use-cases:_** ```java // will fail List list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     } }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     }     {         add(null);     } }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     // foo     {         add(null);     } }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     } // foo }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     }     // foo }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     /* foo */     {         add(null);     } }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     }     /* foo */ }; // will fail list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     } /* foo */ }; // will not fail list = new ArrayList() {     {         add(null);     }      public void foo() {     } }; // will not fail list = new ArrayList() {     private Object o;     {         add(null);     } }; ```  ---  To reach this with 8.18, one could do ```xml                              ```","closed","new module,","Vampire","2019-02-25T13:36:14Z","2020-02-05T05:05:55Z"

Currently, when deciding if an audit event should be suppressed, this filter first matches the event source against the `checkFormat`. If that fails, it matches the event module ID against the `checkFormat`. With this PR, the filter instead matches the event module ID against the new `idFormat` property (additional details in issue description).

The reason not to cover the mutations where they were located previously is that it requires two ast nodes with the exact same location, which in an ast build from a source file will only be the case if the compared nodes are the same node. And since the checks enforces that one of the nodes are a method invocation or field access and the other is a declaration it will never  happen that it is the same node that is being compared to it self.

"","6467","New check UncalledPrivateConstructor","If you have a private constructor that is not called by any code in the class, not by any other constructor, not by any factory method, not by any static field initializer, ..., there can basically only two reasons for this.  One reason is, the constructor was used previously but is superfluous now, or should have been used but is not yet.  The other reason is, to prevent instantiation, for example of a static utility class (being it an anti-pattern or not). For those, it is good practice to also throw `UnsupportedOperationException` or similar, to also prevent instantiation via reflection which would still work after making the constructor accessible, but not without bytcode manipulation if an exception is thrown.  So I'd like to suggest a new check that - reacts on all private constructors - searches calls to them - if any found   - check is done successfully - if none found   - if there is at least one other accessible constructor     - log ""uncalled private constructor""   - if all constructors are private     - check whether there is only one statement in the constructor which is an unconditional exception throw       - if not log ""should only throw exception""       - if no statement at all log ""should throw exception""","closed","","Vampire","2019-02-24T00:13:01Z","2019-12-13T00:07:44Z"

"","6558","Tests do not work properly on Windows with LF line endings","If Git is used without modifying line endings on checkout (e. g. `autocrlf=input`), you have Linux line endings on Windows too. The CS tests assume that on Windows the files have Windows line endings.  I personally hate it when a VCS mangles files automagically. I have globally set `autocrlf` to `input` just to remind me to change line ending to LF if I have it at CRLF accidentally on some file, but I don't like to have Git automatically change line endings on checkout, besides that it wastes space on my local disk.  In #6511 @rnveach mentioned that the website of CS requires to use `autocrlf` with `true`. With this the problem of course does not happen. But I'd suggest to instead fix these incompatibilities in the tests and then maybe require instead not to have `autocrlf` at `false` for CS instead? For the result in the repository this would mean the same whether it is set to `true` or `input`, which is line endings in the repository are LF. And for most users this should be the case anyway.  With the changes I propose, the tests work properly on Windows, whether someone has linux line endings or windows line endings doesn't matter anymore. You could (should?) actually also add another build job that runs with `autocrlf` set to `input` or `false` on the Windows build machines to make sure it stays like that in the future.

"","6396","Improve documentation of ""cacheFile"" property","I just stumbled over the ""cacheFile"" property by accident. The documentation at http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html#Properties is very short, it basically just describes how to set the file name.  What is really missing in the documentation, however, is an answer to the question, when is caching safe to be used and when not? Do I as a user have to watch for some corner cases, or can I always enable this locally and on my CI server? Is it okay to re-use a cachefile from another branch, when running multi-branch-builds on Jenkins?  Side note: Depending on the outcome, we may also want to check if that property should be set by the eclipse plugin by default.","closed","","Bananeweizen","2019-01-28T12:50:31Z","2019-01-31T10:35:57Z"

In the same way your development environment will do. If you do merges and continuous builds, than you would like to check this automatically.  ``` cat OrderedPropertiesCheckConfig.xml          ```   # Here some examples  ## Only the order of keys is important. Here the value are in correct order, but it is not relevant.  ``` cat src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/orderedproperties/InputOrderedProperties1OrderKey.properties #only order of keys are important key2=value1 key1=value2 - violation ```  Now correctly sorted:  ``` cat src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/orderedproperties/ExpectedOrderedProperties1OrderKey.properties key1=value2 #only order of keys are important key2=value1 ```  ## Test the order of an empty value.   An empty value is not relevant. key11 was only added because I no not know how to ""verify"" without errors.  ``` cat src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/orderedproperties/InputOrderedProperties2EmptyValue.properties key1= key2=value2 key11=value1 - violation ```  ## Here we would like to use an Locale independent order mechanism, an binary order.   This is available with String.compareTo() method. As reference you can use the ascii table.   * The @ sign is on position 64 and comes first  * The capital A is on 65 and the lowercase a is on position 97 on the ascii table  * On line 4 you have an a umlaut. This belongs to the extended ascii table and comes at last position. This is the violation here.  * Key and subkey are in correct order here, because only keys are relevant.   Therefore on line 5 you have only ""key"" an nothing behind.  On line 6 you have ""key."" The dot is on position 46 which is higher than nothing.   ``` cat -b  src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/orderedproperties/InputOrderedProperties3BinaryOrder.properties      1	@=64      2	A=65      3	a=97      4	ä=132 - violation      5	key=107 than nothing      6	key.sub=k is 107 and dot is 46 ```  ## Number before text  ``` cat src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/orderedproperties/InputOrderedProperties4Numbers.properties hello=Hello # key cancel should be before hello cancel=Cancel - violation 3=3 - violation 22=22 - violation 111=111 - violation 01=01 - violation  ```  Now correctly sorted:  ``` cat src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/orderedproperties/ExpectedOrderedProperties4Numbers.properties 01=01 111=111 22=22 3=3 # key cancel should be before hello cancel=Cancel hello=Hello  ```   # Implementation  The implementation can be found here:  https://github.com/thomassenger/checkstyle/tree/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/OrderedPropertiesCheck.java","closed","new module,","thomassenger","2018-12-23T15:32:56Z","2019-06-21T15:36:40Z"

This alone is already confusing enough, especially as there is also a `NoWhitespaceBefore` check that actually cannot check these tokens. - The output for violations isn't any better, especially if you didn't read the documentation closely, it mentions the token that is present before the violating token, with the coordinates of the actual violating token (the `[`), which both is confusing as the coordinates do not match the mentioned token position and the mentioned token does not reflect what was configured as tokens to check.  I'd suggest removing these two tokens from this check and instead moving them to the `NoWhitespaceBefore` check which seems to be a much better, clearer and more intuitive place for me.  --------------","open","approved,","Vampire","2019-04-30T16:30:39Z","2021-04-26T15:18:43Z"

Having the forced name should not suppress the finding alone though. Whether an empty catch block is ok or not should still be configurable separately.

The main problem with this is, that XPath 2.0 is not backwards compatible to XPath 1.0, for example `""4"" > ""4.0""` will be a numerical comparison in 1.0 but a string comparison in 2.0 and thus get different results, besides that it is nice to know that you can use more advanced constructs in your queries.","open","xpath,","Vampire","2019-02-22T19:09:39Z","2020-03-14T23:18:25Z"

Thank you for the tool - we have been using if for years!  ### Problem  I'm trying to cleanly integrate Checkstyle with Gradle and for this I need to programmatically invoke Checkstyle from Java (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/7867). com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Main#main() does not work because it calls System.exit().  ### Suggested solution  Options:  a) provide Java API b) avoid System.exit() in main() c) offer a CLI flag / system property to prevent System.exit() in main() d) as a user I can use security manager to catch ""exitVM"" attempts  a) From what I gathered there isn't a Java API today. Adding it is an extra work, test, future maintenance. As a user I actually prefer to call main() because it is more stable (minimum API footprint) for the long game. It reuses CLI code so I feel safer as user that it won't break. b) An incompatible change. c) Good, pragmatic option. d) I am experimenting with this workaround now. I'm not entirely happy with it because in the past I did not find SecurityManager as a reliable solution to this use case (preventing 3rd party code from exiting vm).  I suggest we go for c). I can put together a PR but first I would like know if you would accept it.","closed","","mockitoguy","2018-11-30T21:55:18Z","2018-12-08T06:36:39Z"

"","6961","New Check PreferExpressionLambda","Extracted from comment in #120, a new check would be nice that advices to use expression lambdas if a full-fledged lambda contains only one expression the result of which is returned.  For example `Stream.of(""1"", ""2"", ""3"").map(string -> { return Integer.valueOf(string, 10); });` should be advised to `Stream.of(""1"", ""2"", ""3"").map(string -> Integer.valueOf(string, 10));` or `Stream.of(""1"", ""2"", ""3"").map(string -> { return string.indexOf('a'); });` to `Stream.of(""1"", ""2"", ""3"").map(string -> string.indexOf('a'));`  Why I thought it might make sense to have this combined with the PreferMethodReferenceCheck is, because if this is a separate check it will either partly report the same lambdas as PreferMethodReferenceCheck. An option would be to optionally also check whether it could even be a method reference and do not report a violation in that case. This would make the check more complex than necessary though, as without the check should be pretty straight-forward. And even if this check is done, it should be controllable by a property, as one might dislike method references but still want to have expression lambdas suggested.  For example `Stream.of(1, 2, 3).map(integer -> { return integer.doubleValue(); });` will be reported (I hope) by PreferMethodReferenceCheck to be changed to `Stream.of(1, 2, 3).map(Integer::doubleValue);` while it will also be reported by this check to be changed to `Stream.of(1, 2, 3).map(integer -> integer.doubleValue());`","closed","","Vampire","2019-08-09T15:53:23Z","2019-08-09T16:38:21Z"

Following violations appear:  Inheritance issues   Abstract class without abstract methods  File:    AbstractXpathTestSupport  Message: Class 'AbstractXpathTestSupport' is declared 'abstract', and has no 'abstract' methods   TODO: this should not be abstract, need to be fixed.  Nuance (probably is reason why it become Abstract): If we fix we run into checkstyle violation -  `[checkstyle] [ERROR] src/it/java/org/checkstyle/suppressionxpathfilter/XpathTestSupport.java:0: File not match folder pattern '[\\/]src[\\/]it[\\/]java[\\/]' and file pattern '^((\w+Test)|(Abstract\w+))\.java$'. [RegexpOnFilename] `   ===============   J2ME issues - Abstract class which has only one direct inheritor Abstract class 'XXXXXXX' has only one direct inheritor  Files: AbstractIndentationTestSupport AbstractPathTestSupport  IDEA description: This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments. Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design. Reports abstract classes which have precisely one direct inheritor. While such classes may offer admirable clarity of design, in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments, they needlessly increase the total footprint of the application. Consider merging the abstract class with its inheritor.    TODO: we need to suppress this inspection with note: ""we are not limited in resources and we a library so there are more usages outside of our code""   =========================  Javadoc - Declaration has problems in Javadoc references  file: AbstractModuleTestSupport  Messages: Cannot resolve symbol 'getConfiguration()' Cannot resolve symbol 'getConfiguration()' Cannot resolve symbol 'getConfiguration()'  TODO: just fix such problems  =========================  Performance - 'Collection.toArray()' call style  Message: Call to 'toArray()' with pre-sized array argument 'new Integer[result.size()]'  Files: AbstractIndentationTestSupport AbstractModuleTestSupport  Description:  There are two styles to convert a collection to an array: either using a pre-sized array (like c.toArray(new String[c.size()])) or using an empty array (like c.toArray(new String[0]). In older Java versions using pre-sized array was recommended, as the reflection call which is necessary to create an array of proper size was quite slow. However since late updates of OpenJDK 6 this call was intrinsified, making the performance of the empty array version the same and sometimes even better, compared to the pre-sized version. Also passing pre-sized array is dangerous for a concurrent or synchronized collection as a data race is possible between the size and toArray call which may result in extra nulls at the end of the array, if the collection was concurrently shrunk during the operation. This inspection allows to follow the uniform style: either using an empty array (which is recommended in modern Java) or using a pre-sized array (which might be faster in older Java versions or non-HotSpot based JVMs).   After a fix there is violation from another inspection  ""Memory - Zero-length array allocation""  Decription: Reports on allocations of arrays with known lengths of zero. Since array lengths in Java are non-modifiable, it is almost always possible to share zero-length arrays, rather than repeatedly allocating new zero-length arrays. Such sharing may provide useful optimizations in program runtime or footprint. Note that this inspection does not report zero-length arrays allocated as static final fields, as it is assumed that those arrays are being used to implement array sharing.    Lets suppress ""Zero-length array allocation"" completely with note: ""conficting with ""    ========================","closed","miscellaneous,","romani","2018-07-14T03:17:24Z","2018-07-28T07:01:25Z"

I looked at the IT folder some and we don't have good input file names or their folder names too. It would require renaming all our files and folders there.  I believe this was missed because of the google folders and we just skipped them. Though they should be named `Input` even in google, I am not sure we forced the folder to match the name of the test like we did in `test` folder.  Test should be fixed to validate the IT folder some. Our regression area in IT should be fixed to match our pattern in Test folder. Google and Sun area should atleast start with Input, but their folder structure follows a different pattern.","open","approved,","rnveach","2019-08-15T09:42:49Z","2020-05-07T06:30:33Z"

"","6563","Site files are not schema-valid","Currently the `validate` property of the `maven-site-plugin` is disabled because of a bug in `xml-maven-plugin` that was fixed in `1.0.2`. Since checkstyle in the meantime uses that version, the `validate` could be enabled again. Unfortunately in the long time it was off, some invalid markup made it into the site files.  I'd like to suggest to reenable the validation and fix the invalid parts. In detail this would be: - text directly within `` needs to be wrapped in paragraphs - block tags like `` or `` must not occur within paragraphs, but besides - `` tag does not allow `class` attribute but instead you have to wrap a `` around it and adapt the CSS accordingly to have the wanted effect - Within `` only `` is allowed, not `` like in the release notes, but via CSS placement it can still look the same in the end even with the release date within the section which is semantically cleaner anyway as it belongs to the respective version (this also needs to be changed in the release notes generator template) - Not exactly due to schema-validity, but because the `wrap-content` style needs to be changed anyway I also suggest to change it a tad bit, so that not `white-space: pre-wrap` but `white-space: pre-line` is used.  With the former all whitespace is preserved, but if space gets narrow (too long text, too much zoom) the text is automatically wrapped. With the latter line-breaks are preserved, but leading spaces are stripped from each line. This means, that you can then properly indent the code in the sources or you can have them at column 0 or anywhere in between and it will look the same on the final page so it doesn't matter if someone indents it accidentally for example unlike currently. This also means if you want to have visual indentation on the page, you have to use a non-breaking space as ` `. Another big plus you get which is why I looked into it actually is, that also trailing spaces get removed which looks nicer in the result. ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325196/54167991-c4c65600-446c-11e9-9e1a-636ad8174c56.png) vs. ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325196/54167932-947eb780-446c-11e9-8f14-7b92d49a54a4.png) And in the code ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325196/54168106-41593480-446d-11e9-9662-74e3c1a7a56c.png) vs. ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325196/54168071-1ec71b80-446d-11e9-90f3-0a36568d214e.png)","closed","miscellaneous,","Vampire","2019-03-12T01:21:01Z","2019-03-16T13:32:24Z"

"","6988","Xpath results are not sorted in document order","Current xpath implementation works well (I hope:) ), but I faced one problem,  When you want to access xpath results by index `[index]` and you care about ordering of the results, but results are sorted in alphabetic order. Logically results should ordered as they appear in document  **XML Path Language (XPath)** [link](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/#dt-document-order)  > There is an ordering, document order, defined on all the nodes in the document corresponding to the order in which the first character of the XML representation of each node occurs in the XML representation of the document after expansion of general entities. Thus, the root node will be the first node. Element nodes occur before their children. Thus, document order orders element nodes in order of the occurrence of their start-tag in the XML (after expansion of entities). The attribute nodes and namespace nodes of an element occur before the children of the element. The namespace nodes are defined to occur before the attribute nodes. The relative order of namespace nodes is implementation-dependent. The relative order of attribute nodes is implementation-dependent. Reverse document order is the reverse of document order.  **XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 Programmer's Reference by Michael Kay, page 492**  > The nodes in a sequence can always be sorted into document order. For elements from the same document, document order is the same as the order of the start tags in the original source. In terms of the tree structure, a node is ordered after its preceding siblings, and these are ordered after their parent node.  The following test demonstrates such situation with sorting and indexing  Example ``` /var/tmp $ cat InputXpathMapperAst.java package com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.xpath.xpathmapper;  public class InputXpathMapperAst {      /**      * Returns if current node has children.      * @return if current node has children      */     public void callSomeMethod() {         int variable = 123;         String another = ""HelloWorld"";         String[] array = new String[3];         for (String cycle : array) {          }     }      /**      * Returns if current node has children.      * @return if current node has children      */     public String getSomeMethod() {         return ""HelloWorld"";     } } ``` ``` /var/tmp $ java -jar checkstyle-8.24-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -J InputXpathMapperAst.java ...     |   `--SLIST -> { [9:33]     |       |--VARIABLE_DEF -> VARIABLE_DEF [10:8]     |       |   |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [10:8]     |       |   |--TYPE -> TYPE [10:8]     |       |   |   `--LITERAL_INT -> int [10:8]     |       |   |--IDENT -> variable [10:12]     |       |   `--ASSIGN -> = [10:21]     |       |       `--EXPR -> EXPR [10:23]     |       |           `--NUM_INT -> 123 [10:23]     |       |--SEMI -> ; [10:26]     |       |--VARIABLE_DEF -> VARIABLE_DEF [11:8]     |       |   |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [11:8]     |       |   |--TYPE -> TYPE [11:8]     |       |   |   `--IDENT -> String [11:8]     |       |   |--IDENT -> another [11:15]     |       |   `--ASSIGN -> = [11:23]     |       |       `--EXPR -> EXPR [11:25]     |       |           `--STRING_LITERAL -> ""HelloWorld"" [11:25]     |       |--SEMI -> ; [11:37]     |       |--VARIABLE_DEF -> VARIABLE_DEF [12:14]     |       |   |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [12:14]     |       |   |--TYPE -> TYPE [12:14]     |       |   |   `--ARRAY_DECLARATOR -> [ [12:14]     |       |   |       |--IDENT -> String [12:8]     |       |   |       `--RBRACK -> ] [12:15]     |       |   |--IDENT -> array [12:17]     |       |   `--ASSIGN -> = [12:23]     |       |       `--EXPR -> EXPR [12:25]     |       |           `--LITERAL_NEW -> new [12:25]     |       |               |--IDENT -> String [12:29]     |       |               `--ARRAY_DECLARATOR -> [ [12:35]     |       |                   |--EXPR -> EXPR [12:36]     |       |                   |   `--NUM_INT -> 3 [12:36]     |       |                   `--RBRACK -> ] [12:37]     |       |--SEMI -> ; [12:38]     |       |--LITERAL_FOR -> for [13:8]     |       |   |--LPAREN -> ( [13:12]     |       |   |--FOR_EACH_CLAUSE -> FOR_EACH_CLAUSE [13:13]     |       |   |   |--VARIABLE_DEF -> VARIABLE_DEF [13:13]     |       |   |   |   |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS [13:13]     |       |   |   |   |--TYPE -> TYPE [13:13]     |       |   |   |   |   `--IDENT -> String [13:13]     |       |   |   |   `--IDENT -> cycle [13:20]     |       |   |   |--COLON -> : [13:26]     |       |   |   `--EXPR -> EXPR [13:28]     |       |   |       `--IDENT -> array [13:28]     |       |   |--RPAREN -> ) [13:33]     |       |   `--SLIST -> { [13:35]     |       |       `--RCURLY -> } [15:8]     |       `--RCURLY -> } [16:4] ...  ```  XpathMapperTest ``` @Test public void testOrdering() throws Exception {     final String xpath =         ""(//METHOD_DEF[./IDENT[@text='callSomeMethod']]/SLIST/*)[1]"";     final RootNode rootNode = getRootNode(""InputXpathMapperAst.java"");     final DetailAST[] actual = convertToArray(getXpathItems(xpath, rootNode));     final DetailAST expectedVariableDefNode = getSiblingByType(            rootNode.getUnderlyingNode(), TokenTypes.CLASS_DEF)             .findFirstToken(TokenTypes.OBJBLOCK)             .findFirstToken(TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF)             .findFirstToken(TokenTypes.SLIST)             .getFirstChild();     final DetailAST[] expected = {expectedVariableDefNode};     assertArrayEquals(""Result nodes differ from expected"", expected, actual); } ```  As you can see first result must be `VARIABLE_DEF [10:8]`, because it appears earlier in document But our xpath returns `for [13:8]`, simply because of lexicographic order  I think problem is in [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/xpath/AbstractNode.java#L147), maybe this method should be rewritten based on line/column and tree level ```  @Override     public int compareOrder(NodeInfo nodeInfo) {         return getLocalPart().compareTo(nodeInfo.getLocalPart());     } ```  @rnveach @romani","closed","xpath,","timurt","2019-08-17T06:10:59Z","2020-04-18T13:11:00Z"

It suppose to be named `@firstIdentText` and it will never be a problem to understand how to use it. It it will be clear that such attributes are taking value from the same property of AST - getText, but `@firstIdentText` is convenience shortcut over new meaning of  `@text`. Now we have problem even in code with terminology .... the same will be users.  We need to:  rename `@text` to `@firstIdentText` in one issue/pr. It is kind of breaking changes, but it better to make it now, before xpath become primary way of suppression. as second step(#6115), make new `@text` that will work only for current tree node. Ones we do this, all will be clear even without that much of documentation. But we still need to explain why not all nodes have `@text`(in new meaning), but it is ok.  **Migration notes:**  simply rename attribute from `@text` to `@firstIdentText`. If #6115 released in the same release, than there will be exception during filter execution on null value of `@text` on non IDENT nodes, you need just rename `@text` to `@firstIdentText`.","open","breaking compatibility,","romani","2018-12-02T14:50:41Z","2018-12-05T05:20:43Z"

"","6232","Loading config.xml from classpath doesn't work properly","According to [the Command Line Usage documentation](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/cmdline.html), it should be possible to load `config.xml` from classpath using the same `-c` option as when loading it from file directly. This is a nice feature, and I'd like to exploit it for all my projects, except that it doesn't work properly.  ### Steps to reproduce:  1. Assume a standard Maven project structure with sources, resources, and test sources. 2. Define a Checkstyle config file `src/main/java/resources/my_checks.xml`: ```    ``` 3. Define a unit test `src/test/java/CheckstyleTest.java`: ``` import java.io.File; import java.io.FileOutputStream;  import org.junit.Test;  public class CheckstyleTest {  	@Test 	public void loadConfigFromClasspath() throws Throwable { 		String configurationResource = ""my_checks.xml""; 		String javaSource = ""class MyClass {}""; 		File javaSourceFile = File.createTempFile(""MyClass"", "".java""); 		try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(javaSourceFile)) { 			out.write(javaSource.getBytes(""UTF-8"")); 		} 		com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Main.main(""-c"", configurationResource, javaSourceFile.getCanonicalPath()); 	} } ``` 4. Run the test.   * *Expected:* test is green.   * *Actual:* test fails with ""Could not find config XML file 'my_checks.xml'."", ""Process finished with exit code 255"".  ### Root cause  The root cause is a bug in the method `com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.utils.CommonUtil.getUriByFilename`, line 286 in version 8.14:  ``` URL configUrl = CommonUtil.class.getResource(filename); ```  That call loads `filename` relative to the package of `CommonUtil`, which is `com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/utils`. I can hardly imagine this is the intent, it would make much more sense to load it relative to the ""root"" of the classpath. The fix is very easy (and I hope will be included in the one of the next versions of Checkstyle soon):  ``` URL configUrl = CommonUtil.class.getClassLoader().getResource(filename); ```  ### Workaround  Now that we know the root cause, it's easy to come up with a workaround.  The first workaround is to use an absolute (resource) path to load the resource in my test: ``` 		String configurationResource = ""/my_checks.xml""; ``` This forces the class loader to look in the root of the classpath. It's not so elegant, but I can live with it.  The second workaround is to move `src/main/resources/my_checks.xml` to `src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/utils/my_checks.xml`, which is not so elegant either.","closed","approved,","peterdemaeyer","2018-11-25T13:31:15Z","2019-06-07T01:08:58Z"

UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS: Users still can activate not very secure behavior by system property `checkstyle.enableExternalDtdLoad`, so simply make your CLI execution like `java -Dcheckstyle.enableExternalDtdLoad=true -jar ......`. Or activate system property by any other way in your checkstyle execution.  ATTENTION: user on old versions of checkstyle that reference to DTD files `http` (not secure) hosting on sourceforge.net will be forced to upgrade to at least to `https` versions of DTD files. Removal of DTDs on `http` hosting will be done in scope of -  #6478.","closed","breaking compatibility,","romani","2019-02-24T15:42:58Z","2019-04-24T00:25:29Z"

"","6127","EqualsHashCode is overly strict","`EqualsHashCode` is overly strict. It fails not only when there is an `equals` without `hashCode`, but also when there is a `hashCode` without `equals`. The former is a bug, the latter not necessarily. This behavior has changed somewhere in between Checkstyle 6.18 and 8.12.  Expected: a way to configure Checkstyle to fail on `equals` without `hashCode`, but _not_ on `hashCode` without `equals`. A potential solution could be to extend `EqualsHashCode` with an additional property.  Workaround: add `equals` methods on all affected classes and delegate the call to `super.equals`. That makes Checkstyle happy again, but introduces useless code.  Template for bug reporting:  ```bash peter@pangolin:~/IdeaProjects/Checkstyle#6127$ javac src/HashCodeNoEquals.java  peter@pangolin:~/IdeaProjects/Checkstyle#6127$ cat config.xml                         peter@pangolin:~/IdeaProjects/Checkstyle#6127$ cat src/HashCodeNoEquals.java  public class HashCodeNoEquals {      @Override     public int hashCode() {         return super.hashCode();     } }  $ java $RUN_LOCALE -jar checkstyle-8.13-all.jar -c config.xml src/HashCodeNoEquals.java  Starting audit... [ERROR] /home/.../HashCodeNoEquals.java:6:5: Definition of 'hashCode()' without corresponding definition of 'equals()'. [EqualsHashCode] Audit done. Checkstyle ends with 1 errors. ```  Expected: an option to configure the check to report a violation for `hashCode` without equals but not for equals without `hashCode`.  Actual: no such option, the workaround is to use suppressions as suggested by @rnveach (I didn't test it) or just implement `hashCode` everywhere with a silly `super.hashCode`.","closed","","peterdemaeyer","2018-09-21T12:28:37Z","2018-11-18T00:26:32Z"

I've looked at `pax` and `cpio` and `tar`, and none of them seem to support pipe-to-pipe extraction (which is really disappointing).  This approach seems to work ""well enough"" for this one rpm, and I suspect it's fairly close to correct based on https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man4/cpio.4.asp namely, each row has a `0707` magic field at the start, and there's a `\0` delimiter.

[TypeName] ```  ---------------  In a pure form, Checkstyle ""Google Checks"" rule should agree with and not fail the output of the very Google Java Format tool.   Granted, there are cases that could (and should) be formatted better than the Google Java Format tool can or does but present disagreement is nevertheless a problem. Specifically:  1. If one is running Google Java Format always (i.e. ""on save"" or similarly), Checkstyle isn't helpful in any sort of way to begin with as the format cannot be influenced - Google formatter will modify even the code that does (in principle) conform to the described Google style guide. 2. If the Google Java Format is only used as an occasional helper, it may produce code that Checkstyle won't like, thus it isn't a helper. Yet it is considered to be the authority in terms of Google style. 3. Those with legacy code who want to reformat once and just maintain (using Checkstyle) thereafter it may face huge challenges as GJF will produce or leave out many things that Checkstyle won't like - in my case thousands of them, something that cannot be easily overcome.  I do not ""believe"" in formatters as we have available today. Code style is not for machines, it is for humans. There are many different ways to *properly* style the same code - i.e. to wrap a long line or indent that long expression, comment or a SQL statement concatenated in multiple lines - each may hugely improve readability yet are beyond automated formatter's ""comprehension"".  This is why we are trying to let humans style their code for humans, and only apply reasonable style restrictions via Checkstyle. That is hard, though, when the tools don't cooperate with each other or when the tools (Checkstyle in this case) don't accept clearly accepted code styles.  I realize that this is (probably) many issues, but I did not want to break them into bits myself. Some are easily addressable, such as the identifier patterns but the indentation and brace positions issues are both related and rigid - i.e. I have not found workarounds.    --------------  Still not clear ??? see example - https://checkstyle.org/report_issue.html#How_to_report_a_bug","closed","","GwtarPlayer","2019-03-07T21:55:49Z","2019-03-09T05:10:31Z"

When it was ""AssertTrue"" .... you simply read message and move further to condition and expresson like `!sectionName.endsWith(""Check"")` is easy to read as `not sectionName endsWith(""Check"")` You do not need to remember what was in the beginning of AssertTrue or AssertFalse.  Your reading is simple, last expression should be TRUE, `!` is located very close to expression so it is easy to interpretate it.  BUT  after a fix, you have to pay attention to type of assertion, as it might be negative `AssertFalse`, so last expression should be interpretated with caution, and negative sign is located too far from expression. This become more the issue as we use messages in each assert, so  `AssertFalse(sectionName.endsWith(""Check""))` is not same as ``` AssertFalse(fileName + "" section '"" + sectionName                         + ""' shouldn't end with 'Check'"", sectionName.endsWith(""Check"")) ``` ======  I am in favor to disable this condition, in our case it make code hard to read.

"","6133","Disable XML External Entity load in XmlUtil.java in tests","# The Issue  An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.  # Where the Issue Occurred  The following code snippets display the usage of `XMLReader` without securely disabling entities:  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/27512b0acc3ad3cb4e28306d4f8936b9108c5bca/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/internal/utils/XmlUtil.java#L56","closed","miscellaneous,","prodigysml","2018-09-29T13:15:23Z","2019-03-16T12:27:01Z"
