If the default  bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file  using the --cacert option. If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in  the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a  problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might  not match the domain name in the URL).

Mostly because Mockito framework does not support mocking of a static methods prior to version 3.4.0. For today, the Powermock is not compatible with JDK17 and abandoned. This is a blocker for the future development. We can not set up a JDK17 build (#10905), so we can not test JDK17-specific features.  But we can replace `PowerMock.mockStatic` with `Mockito.mockStatic` if we switch to new [mockito-inline](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-inline) framework.  Unfortunately, both frameworks (mockito-inline and powermock) cannot coexist. So we need to drop the Powermocks library first. Some work will be done in #7368.

Pitest artifacts are preserved BUT as zips - https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/actions/runs/1044325180 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812984/127785463-2493d131-cb89-4bca-ad98-5e7413f78e5a.png)   Current issues:  1. If Pitest fails, artifacts are not created for that specific pitest.

With two differences: these methods make accessible only the requested field/method, not all of them including methods from `Object` class and do not ""unwrap"" `InvocationTargetException` cause.  The import config now forbids usage of `Whitebox` and low-level reflection API (with some exceptions).","closed","","pbludov","2021-10-24T13:07:30Z","2022-04-16T09:31:42Z"

Comment was originally designed to warn users to not just update the count for no reason to pass the test. The new tokens need to be added as well as updating the count. The comment should stick to the count and the wording was made a bit clearer to help that.  Javadoc had no similar counting system for things to be added when new changes are made. This was added.

Though these are valid packages, they contain no checkstyle meta files when searching. When `filters` and `filefilters` are removed from `checkstyle_packages.xml`, the exception goes away, everything passes with no issues.  This is not an issue in eclipse-cs *currently* because eclipse-cs still has its own metadata resource files for these packages which I assume is preventing the library issue. Removing the files causes the exception to show up. This issue looks like it is preventing the completion of https://github.com/checkstyle/eclipse-cs/issues/256 and removing all eclipse-cs meta files.  This issue can occur outside eclipse-cs' files if a 3rd party check provides their own `checkstyle_packages.xml` with checks but provide no resource files in the package. As an example, they can put their checks in 1 folder and their meta files in another.  This issue was also confirmed in the library at https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections/issues/273 .

This message gives no guidance on the issue and how to resolve.  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/config/checkstyle_input_checks.xml#L20-L28 I understand we have a checkstyle item to print out the requirement of the BDD text, but that checkstyle item is only run after the tests and not before. Again, this doesn't help new users as they expect things to be clear when validated by the default order (which is currently compile, junits, IT, checks. external checks, etc...). Even outside the order, the users can build and debug their tests before even touching the checkstyle run.  We should change the parser to validate the necessity of the BDD text and it be in the correct location and remove the checkstyle item.

Maybe this was a bug that was fixed or is a new bug.  Here is my old definition (8.20): ```                                                                                                 ```  Here is my new definition (8.39): ```                                                               ```  The change is related to missing parameters:  My Javadoc looks as follows: ```     /**      * Create a component using this model.      *      * @param inModel      */  public Component(Model inModel) {         _model = inModel;     } ```  In 8.20 this would fail with Expected @param tag for 'inModel' [JavadocMethod]  In 8.39 is does not fail  If I add anything after the @param inModel in 8.20 then it passes.  This forced me to add (meaningful?) docs as in:      * @param inModel The model that will be used to save the world.       I thought this was a useful feature.  The thing is the check was satisfied even if I just add a single space after the parameter name.  So I don't know if this was a feature that went away or a bug that was fixed.  I preferred the old behavior.  Thanks, Michael","closed","","vendmr23","2021-07-14T22:30:11Z","2021-09-04T19:14:39Z"

I've created a test case to reproduce this as well. I think the root cause of this issue is that ANTLR generates a different offset for the SEMI or COMMA token. Using the test file https://github.com/dijkstraj/checkstyle/blob/emoji-8/src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/InputAstRegressionEmojiString.java the generated AST (https://github.com/dijkstraj/checkstyle/blob/emoji-8/src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/InputAstRegressionEmojiString.txt) has columns 33 and 34 for the semicolons in version 8.45.1, but columns 31 and 34 in master (https://github.com/dijkstraj/checkstyle/blob/emoji-9/src/test/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/InputAstRegressionEmojiString.txt). So it looks like a difference between character and byte offset.

"","10858","Add Checkstyle from PR to Github's Diff Report","I have noticed this for a while and couldn't find an issue so I am creating this now.  When Github runs regression on a project, it only runs it on checkstyle master( this is what defined in property file). While this ideal we run it on checkstyle, when fixing a bug, if the bug doesn't have files that reproduce problem in master we get a clean report showing no differences. See https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/10857 as the latest example.  This ""clean"" report requires extra precautions as the users currently supply the config. If the config is wrong in any way, this clean report can be a false positive and may be easy to miss.  Users are required to create tests and input files for their fixes to show the error the user reported is fixed and won't come back again. While we look at these, it is not always straightforward if the issue is recreated correctly. Slight deviations could fail to duplicate the issue and we are looking at the wrong thing.  If we ran regression on this PR version of checkstyle ( specific fork and branch name from PR), it should not be clean and come back with either an error removed (fixing a bug) or a new violation (fixing a false negative). So this run, would also give us the extra confidence that running the new PR on the future master would be a good result and less likely to cause an issue after merge. It would be just regular execution, but in config we will put property for fork name and branch name to get checkstyle sources from PR. So it will be update to support PRs fork name and branch name in file with list of projects .

Please describe.** The problem is that checkstyle crashes when there is a switch that uses pattern-matching  **Describe the solution you'd like**  Checkstyle should update Java-language grammer definition according to the grammar changes described in [JEP 406](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406)  Relevant Java Language changes are [drafted by Gavin Bierman](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~gbierman/jep406/jep406-20210608/specs/patterns-switch-jls.html#jls-14.11.1) to be amended to Java Language Specification in the future.  Here are some excerpts from the JEP:  > We enhance switch statements and expressions in two ways: > >  1. Extend case labels to include patterns in addition to constants, and >  2. Introduce two new kinds of patterns: guarded patterns and parenthesized patterns. >  ...  > First, we introduce a new `null` label for a case, which clearly matches when the value of the selector expression is `null`.  ...  > Consequently, the previous example suggests that we should support a `case null, String s ->` label.  ...  > (The reverse form, case String s, null should also be allowed and behave identically.)  ...  > To do so we introduce a new default case label: > `case null, default ->`  ...  > More precisely, we change the grammar of patterns. > Assuming that the record patterns and array patterns of JEP 405 are added, the grammar for patterns will become: > > ```` >     Pattern: >       PrimaryPattern >       GuardedPattern > >     GuardedPattern: >       PrimaryPattern && ConditionalAndExpression > >     PrimaryPattern: >       TypePattern >       ( Pattern )","closed","new feature,","sviperll","2021-10-06T21:09:38Z","2022-01-23T19:05:19Z"

So this may be a CheckStyle issue rather than a Gradle one.  ``` Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke ""java.util.Map.entrySet()"" because ""this.fTableOfNOTATIONAttributeNames"" is null         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.dtd.XMLDTDProcessor.endDTD(XMLDTDProcessor.java:1301)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDTDScannerImpl.endEntity(XMLDTDScannerImpl.java:658)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLEntityManager.endEntity(XMLEntityManager.java:1507)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLEntityScanner.load(XMLEntityScanner.java:1925)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLEntityScanner.skipSpaces(XMLEntityScanner.java:1664)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDTDScannerImpl.skipSeparator(XMLDTDScannerImpl.java:2088)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDTDScannerImpl.scanDecls(XMLDTDScannerImpl.java:2064)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDTDScannerImpl.scanDTDExternalSubset(XMLDTDScannerImpl.java:299)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentScannerImpl$DTDDriver.dispatch(XMLDocumentScannerImpl.java:1165)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentScannerImpl$DTDDriver.next(XMLDocumentScannerImpl.java:1040)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentScannerImpl$PrologDriver.next(XMLDocumentScannerImpl.java:917)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentScannerImpl.next(XMLDocumentScannerImpl.java:605)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl.scanDocument(XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl.java:541)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(XML11Configuration.java:888)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(XML11Configuration.java:824)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.XMLParser.parse(XMLParser.java:141)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.AbstractSAXParser.parse(AbstractSAXParser.java:1224)         at java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser.parse(SAXParserImpl.java:635)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.XmlLoader.parseInputSource(XmlLoader.java:86)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.filters.SuppressionsLoader.getSuppressionLoader(SuppressionsLoader.java:283)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.filters.SuppressionsLoader.loadSuppressions(SuppressionsLoader.java:238)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.filters.SuppressionsLoader.loadSuppressions(SuppressionsLoader.java:224)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.filters.SuppressionFilter.finishLocalSetup(SuppressionFilter.java:274)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.AutomaticBean.configure(AutomaticBean.java:197)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Checker.setupChild(Checker.java:468)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.AutomaticBean.configure(AutomaticBean.java:201)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.ant.CheckstyleAntTask.createRootModule(CheckstyleAntTask.java:424)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.ant.CheckstyleAntTask.realExecute(CheckstyleAntTask.java:320)         at com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.ant.CheckstyleAntTask.execute(CheckstyleAntTask.java:302)         at org.apache.tools.ant.UnknownElement.execute(UnknownElement.java:292)         at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)         at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:78)         at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)         at org.apache.tools.ant.dispatch.DispatchUtils.execute(DispatchUtils.java:99)         ... 142 more ```","closed","","ddidier","2021-09-08T12:21:54Z","2021-09-09T18:14:40Z"
"","10939","Activating a research fault localization bot on your project?","Hi!   We are software engineering researchers and are currently looking for active open-source projects where we could test a new cool software bot: flacocobot!  When a new pull request is open, if it has test failures/errors, flacocobot analyzes the failure and posts a diagnosis as comments to the pull request, highlighting the most suspicious lines that likely need to be analyzed to fix the bug.  flacocobot works as follows:  - When a new PR is open, if the test suite fails, flacocobot starts its analysis. - The top k suspicious (potentially buggy) lines of code are then highlighted as comments to the PR.  We would love to have your feedback in order to understand what you like or you do not like, what we can improve, and if you find it useful!  If you are interested in trying it, we will run flacocobot on your project for a period of two weeks and then give you a 1-minute questionnaire to collect your feedback.  What do you think? Can we activate flacocobot for [checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle)?  Thanks,  Davide (@dginelli), André (@andre15silva), Matias (@martinezmatias), Benjamin (@danglotb), Martin (@monperrus)  You can find out more in our tools repos: - https://github.com/SpoonLabs/flacoco - https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator","closed","","dginelli","2021-11-10T10:12:02Z","2021-12-07T15:29:36Z"

I've discovered this on Checkstyle 9.0, but the same problem is still unresolved on the `master` branch.

The expected errors for the above class can be something like  ``` 12:5: Annotation 'Bar' should be adjacent to its sibling at line '14'. 17:5: Annotation 'Bar' should be adjacent to its sibling at line '20'. 22:5: Annotation 'Foo' should be adjacent to its sibling at line '24'. 24:5: Annotation 'Bar' should be adjacent to its sibling at line '26'. 36:14: Annotation 'Foo' should be adjacent to its sibling at line '38' ```  The error messages obviously highlight where the 'lonely' annotation is, along with the line number of its sibling.   Configuration-wise, it's the same as the `AnnotationOnSameLineCheck`, so you can configure which tokens to check against.  ```                              ```  Draft PR with implementation https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/10789/files that can be reused to continue","open","","Impakt","2021-06-25T07:48:47Z","2022-03-17T16:05:59Z"

"","10627","minor: rename CheckstyleJavaParser.g4 and JavaLexer.g4 to JavaLanguageParser.g4 and JavaLanguageLexer.g4","From discussion in GSOC discord with @rnveach , we have decided that it is a good idea to make the naming of the parser and lexer grammar consistent, i.e. `Checkstyle...`.   The parser grammar was renamed from `JavaParser` to `CheckstyleJavaParser` to avoid fully qualifying an instance of the `JavaParser` generated ANTLR class when we create it in the existing `JavaParser` class. The `JavaLexer` lexer grammar and generated class should also follow this naming convention.    From chat: > If we use JavaParser , then we are using an instance of a class called JavaParser in a class called JavaParser, and I have to fully qualify the name. Also, it kept opening the wrong file when I use the keystroke/open file dialog in intellij.  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/b154154b6f935086d8a3609c17534188c0d720ae/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/JavaParser.java#L82-L92  ![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812984/129726358-a133bb51-fb4c-4272-ab4f-27b8203b170e.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812984/129727044-53144d66-5f2f-4839-b37e-ba0dcf754b27.png)","closed","","nick-mancuso","2021-08-14T02:22:08Z","2021-08-19T15:16:00Z"

As `JavadocMetadataScraper` is not a part of checkstyle_checks and we need metadata beforehand we execute it with the help of `MetadataGeneraotrUtilTest`. In this PR support was added to show the violations we logged in `JavadocMetadataScraper`.  A separate logger has been created to get rid of `Audit starting...` messages which are printed by the `DefaultLogger`. Inside the test, we capture the output silently and then compare it with the expected violations.","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2021-10-25T07:40:08Z","2022-03-01T16:43:23Z"

Report from investigation of issue here: https://github.com/nmancus1/checkstyle-antlr4-memory-report  Further investigation has led me to the current implementation, and has disproven some results of my previous investigation. In order to keep memory usage down, clearing the lexer DFA is not as important as my original research concluded. Also, I have found that it is not critical to instantiate a new `PredictionContextCache` as some suggested in the ANTLR issues that I read through.  The root of the problem is that ANTLR DFA states are basically stored in an unbounded cache; as long as we keep finding syntax that is different than what has been previously parsed, the number of DFA states (and heap size) continues to grow without bound as we parse more files. The suggested approach of clearing the DFA states upon every parsing operation (every file) had much too high of a time performance cost.  The current implementation (clearing the DFA states every 500 files) gets us to a very good state performance wise; memory consumption is reasonable (stays within all specified JVM heap sizes), and parsing speed is nearly back to ANTLR2 times.  ----------------------  You can see the history of all `no-exception-openjdk16` task execution here (most relevant real life metric of performance of changes in this PR):  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/actions/workflows/no-exception-workflow.yml?query=branch%3Aissue-10934-3  Note that file counter dfa clearing was added 12/29; you can see that most subsequent runs are equal to, or less than 30 minutes.  ---------------------- Some metrics from CI:  | CI task                                       | average of 5 runs on master | PR   | |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------| | no-exception-test.sh guava-with-google-checks | 5:44                        | 3:38 | | no-exception-test.sh guava-with-sun-checks    | 4:33                        | 3:41 | | no-error-pmd                                  | 10:23                       | 9:23 | | java11-verify                                 | 4:37                        | 5:18 | | no-error-xwiki                                | 4:28                        | 3:56 | | no-exception-only-javadoc                     | 6:12                        | 5:41 | | no-exception-lucene-and-others-javadoc        | 7:50                        | 6:15 |  CI tasks always have some variance on run times, but averaging out the master run times of these tasks gives us a good idea of how long certain executions should take.  ---------------------  Diff Regression projects: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nmancus1/179fb374eb149c629322508baadc6ce1/raw/8f926d3450ba23172df94f39fd6901a355550d7a/projects.properties  New module config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nmancus1/ead52600003f218fb17823bc59ea596f/raw/a6cd0780e9f6e13296380c8328f7c064baa6c95e/config.xml","closed","","nick-mancuso","2021-12-03T16:47:18Z","2022-01-15T15:21:14Z"

I ran `pitest.sh pitest-java-ast-visitor` in master branch five times on my local, and all failed as described in #10755. After reviewing the master branch's commit history, I cannot find any reason that this would start failing now after passing many times on my local and on github previously.  I have tested the increased number of concatenations in this PR 20 times on my local, and all have passed.  Link to successful `pitest.sh pitest-java-ast-visitor` run in this PR: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/10761/checks?check_run_id=3461559365  --------------------------------------------  From https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html:  ```java Thread public Thread(ThreadGroup group,               Runnable target,               String name,               long stackSize) ``` Allocates a new Thread object so that it has target as its run object, has the specified name as its name, and belongs to the thread group referred to by group, and has the specified stack size. This constructor is identical to `Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)` with the exception of the fact that it allows the thread stack size to be specified. The stack size is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual machine is to allocate for this thread's stack. *The effect of the stackSize parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.*  On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the stackSize parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater recursion depth before throwing a StackOverflowError. Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of threads to exist concurrently without throwing an OutOfMemoryError (or other internal error). The details of the relationship between the value of the stackSize parameter and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are platform-dependent. On some platforms, the value of the stackSize parameter may have no effect whatsoever.  The virtual machine is free to treat the stackSize parameter as a suggestion. If the specified value is unreasonably low for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific maximum. Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).  Specifying a value of zero for the stackSize parameter will cause this constructor to behave exactly like the Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String) constructor.  Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use. The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will likely vary from one JRE implementation to another. In light of this variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required, and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on which an application is to run.  Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to document their implementation's behavior with respect to the stackSize parameter.  TLDR; **The virtual machine is free to treat the stackSize parameter as a suggestion.**  -----------------------  In light of the above information, I think that if `pitest.sh pitest-java-ast-visitor` continues to be flaky after this PR, we should allow suppression of failing lines in `pitest.sh` until https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/9267","closed","","nick-mancuso","2021-08-30T12:14:29Z","2021-09-01T18:27:39Z"

All differences (in Check regression reports and AST regression reports) fall into the following categories:  1. Diffs are in file that could not be parsed previously, but now we can (usually due to unicode characters). 2. Diffs are in a file that we cannot parse any longer, that is not compilable. 3. Diffs are from correct type parameter placement. This usually happens when one of the types is an array type. Example: Changes at https://nmancus1.github.io/issue-10272_check_diff_reports_2021_08_09/diff_part4/spoon/index.html 4. Diffs are from change in exception message. 5.

Picocli 4.6.2  Picocli 4.6.2 The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.6.2. This release includes bugfixes and enhancements. Many improvements in the documentation. Thanks to the many people in the picocli community for raising issues and contributing pull requests to fix issues! From this release, picocli uses system properties sun.stdout.encoding and sun.stderr.encoding when creating the PrintWriters returned by  CommandLine::getOut and CommandLine::getErr. When these system properties do not exist, picocli falls back to the default charset (determined by file.encoding). This addresses an issue on Windows, where the default charset is not the same as the encoding for its console (often the older cp437 codepage on English-language versions of Windows). Note that these system properties seem to have been introduced in Java 8 (although I cannot find it in the JDK 8 release notes) and may not exist on earlier JVMs or on JVMs other than the Oracle and OpenJDK implementations. This is the seventy-seventh public release. Picocli follows semantic versioning.

If you have one whitespace after the asterisk (*) on the preceding line of a BlockTagGroup, checkstyle gives an error stating the line is not empty. It will resolve itself if I remove the one trailing whitespace, but in the editor I use (VSC), when writing javadoc, it will automatically give a single whitespace after the asterisk when entering a new line. It is a bit annoying having to delete this one trailing whitespace everytime.  Hope you can take a look at this!  ---","closed","duplicate,","erlendps","2021-10-12T16:11:44Z","2022-03-01T12:52:09Z"

And the result of the second call is just discarded (silently!). This may be not what the user expected. Today I spend some time to figure out a DB entity leak. It turns out that method `getOrCreate` was implemented as `Optional.ofNullable(getExisting()).orElse(creteNew())`. And it was creating a new entity on every call. Anyway, making some work and then just discard the result is a bad practice.  The solution is simple: replace `orElse(bar())` with `orElseGet(() -> bar())`. If the `orElse` part is required, then it should be extracted to a variable, like this:  ``` var first = foo();  // it is clear that both methods should be invoked var second = bar();  var value = Optional.ofNullable(first)                 .orElse(second); ```  The idea of new check is to verify that only constant values or variables are passed to `orElse(...)`.  All complicated stuff should be done in `orElseGet(() -> ...)`   A good article for this issue: https://www.baeldung.com/java-optional-or-else-vs-or-else-get","closed","","pbludov","2021-10-26T10:46:47Z","2021-10-30T16:22:25Z"

This is a good idea. Developers should be aware of this. We have a [check](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/38df63e992c1270eac87d5e98d5d8cb281c4a20b/config/checkstyle_sevntu_checks.xml#L215) to forbid some method by its name and number of parameters.   Unfortunately, the ""old"" `log` method is still used by Javadoc checks and filters. See #4830 for the details. This means we should add an entry for `ForbidCertainMethodCheck` and suppress this violation for `*Flter` and `Javadoc*Check`.  _Originally posted by @pbludov in https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/10930#issuecomment-962656895_  -----------------  Confusion between `AbstractCheck#log` methods, as noticed in https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/10930#issuecomment-962656895, can be difficult for contributors to troubleshoot when `XPathRegression...` tests are failing due to suppressions not functioning as expected. It might be a good idea to add some sort of warning about this to the documentation for `AbstractViolationReporter#log` as well. Perhaps we could extend the current summary (`Log a message that has no column information.`) to something like `Log a message that has no column information.

Hopefully, at some point we can use pitest and such on this class to verify it's code.  ### changes InlineConfigParser to respect fully qualified name   This is a simple change to so that when it gets the fully qualified name, it takes as the fully qualified name and doesn't make any other changes. This is all because `JavadocMetadataScrapper` doesn't end with `Check` so BDD can't recognize it. No idea why the class was named this, but BDD should still be changed as I expect the FQN to be the FQN.","closed","miscellaneous,","rnveach","2021-09-26T22:01:41Z","2021-10-02T19:54:52Z"
"","10811","A lot of translations should be reviewed.","### Bug description  There is a lot of translations that are messed up, some of them to the point that some supposedly translated message becomes a meaningless gibberish or just plainly wrong and misleading. For example, the Portuguese message ""_As tags de bloco devem aparecer no pedido ''{0}''._"" made my eyes hurt, because ""pedido"" is as a translation for ""order"" only in the sense of ordering a pizza or a hamburguer somewhere instead of defining the order of javadoc tags.  Also, there is mojibake like ""_KlasÃ¶r deseni ''{0}'' ve dosya deseni ` eÅŸleÅŸmiyor Dosya ''{1}''._""  Even sometimes, the English messages could be improved. For example, ""_Control variable ''{0}'' is modified._"" can be improved to ""_The control variable ''{0}'' should not be modified._"".  Further, some messages ends with periods, some others don't. They all should be standardized by ending with a period (or ""。"" for Japanese and Chinese). The exceptions to this rule should have a good and strong reason for not doing that.  ### Remarks  I am opening several bug reports with the intention of referencing them into a pull request very soon.  Personally, I speak Portuguese natively and also speak English [and contributed with some translations four years ago](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/5082). I also can speak some Spanish and French nowadays, but not very fluently. So, I reviewed everything in those languages. Further, although I don't speak Turkish, German, Finnish, Japanese or Chinese, I also tried to fix a few cases on those languages that I suspected were broken or could be mecanically fixed.","open","approved,","victorwss","2021-09-22T19:36:10Z","2021-11-14T22:26:30Z"
"","10812","Fix up and refactor localization limitations.","## Bug description  There are a few internal problems about localization. I will enumerate them here:  1. There are two bundle caches. One in the `Violation` class and another one in the inner class `LocalizedMessage` inside the `DefaultLogger` class. They should be unified. 2. There is a lot of code duplication between the `AbstractCheck` and `AbstractFileSetCheck` that could be moved up to their common superclass `AbstractViolationReporter` with minimal risk of compatibility breakage. The class `OuterTypeFilenameCheck` might also be involved. 3. There is some tests that verify if the given message is exact. So, any change to the `message.properties` file makes those test break spuriously. This is not desirable. 4. Although the `Locale` should be setwith `-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US` when running the tests in order to ""officially"" validate the build, it is highly desirable that the tests runs, works and passes anyway regardless of the user language, even if ""unofficially"". 5. The `Violation` class features a bunch of constructors and don't impose strong nullability contract about its fields. Usage of static builder methods instead of multiple overload constructors are preferable and the public constructors should be deprecated. Stronger nullability contracts should be imposed when possible. 6. The `Violation` class is intended to be immutable. But its `equals(Object)` method depends on `getViolation()` which depends on the current encoding. Also, `getViolation()` is not used as part of `hashCode()` or `compareTo(Violation)`. This is a fragile behaviour. 7. The `Violation.getViolation()` method repeatedly consults the `ResourceBundle` to build its message and the output might change if the `Locale` changes. Although this seems to be interesting, in practice, it has essentially no value since outside of unit tests, the `Locale` very rarely changes if ever. It would be better to set the message in the construction time and a change to the `Locale` should not retroactively change messages already produced because it is not worth the trouble. 8. Sometimes, changing the `Locale`, specially in unit tests, will produce incorrect results. This happens because the `Locale` is read and stored in different places at different moments. So, changing the `Locale` late, after everything was already initialized don't reliably works. There should be a single one centralized place for the `Locale`. 9. The `AbstractModuleTestSupport` class assumes that each line in the output maps to exactly a single violation. This doesn't hold if some error message contains a line break, which is specially true if the message features a Stack Trace, which is sometimes the case of `""general.exception""`.  ## Remarks  I am opening several bug reports with the intention of referencing them into a pull request very soon.  I could also open separate bugs for all of the above, but I think that it would be an overkill and only one bug report suffices.","open","","victorwss","2021-09-22T20:40:03Z","2021-11-14T22:51:22Z"
