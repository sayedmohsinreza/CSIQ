The only way it can change is if you access the internal fields, for eg - `packages` using reflections and add an element to the set. But in the current code those fields are not modified.   2. ```                                                                              PackageObjectFactory.java                                                    com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.PackageObjectFactory                     createModule                                                           org.pitest.mutationtest.engine.gregor.mutators.RemoveConditionalMutator_EQUAL_IF   removed conditional - replaced equality check with true                    if (!name.contains(PACKAGE_SEPARATOR)) {                                                                                                                            ```  Complete relevant code https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/678c547af6de156c604595fe42ffdd0cb05c0023/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/PackageObjectFactory.java#L186-L196  The mutation is replacing the condition with true, if there is some name with `PACKAGE_SEPARATOR` that enters this branch, then it is guaranteed that it will still remain null. `createFromStandardCheckSet(..)` the standard check set does not contain any module which has `PACKAGE_SEPARATOR` in its short name. `generateThirdPartyNameToFullModuleName(..)` implementation guarantees it that there are no short names which contain `PACKAGE_SEPARATOR` as it uses `Class#getSimpleName()` to get the short name. This condition is only present to reduce the time complexity.","open","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-16T17:50:28Z","2022-07-27T12:46:13Z"

Disable all CI first as separate commit(See example at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/11721). This will help to not waste credits. 2. Pick one single surviving mutation from pitest.sh. 3. Send PR with a single hardcoded mutation only. 4. Generate diff report with hardcoded mutation. 5. Share link to initial commit with hardcoded mutation and initial diff report in PR description. This is in lieu of separate branch/ etc. in previous issue at #7797.   HARDCODED MUTATION WILL NOT BE IN FINAL PR.  We will have one of three outcomes for each mutation (in order of preference): 1. Find a case that kills the mutation via diff report, add new test in existing PR 2. Safely (no regressions) modify code to be covered, in existing PR 3. Safely (no regressions) remove code to be covered, in existing PR  Case (2) and (3) required a detailed analysis and discussion in issue before making any changes.  -----------------------------------  **We will not be pursuing surviving mutations in IndentationCheck or gui package .**","open","miscellaneous,","nick-mancuso","2022-06-11T13:00:16Z","2022-08-01T00:58:17Z"

It does **not** affect the build result, because checkstyle will not find any violations.

"","11606","Suppressions to XPath Suppressions","Subset of https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/11604 ,  Clarification is needed here and in the code on what is the relationship between xpath suppressions and normal suppressions. There are a few conflicts in the code base and there is no simple answer on what this would mean if possibly another walker is added.  Resolving this can help clear up the code and possibly make the design simpler and more expandable in the future. Maybe we create a whole new interface to show the parent/child relationship, or maybe we split code apart to show no connection. It could also mean breaking the existing design for something that makes more sense.  For simplicity, lets say Checker is another form of Walker, it does no parsing but loads the files.  ###  Are xpath suppressions a sub-filter of suppressions?  Currently suppressions and xpath suppressions code is in the same file, https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/filters/SuppressionsLoader.java#L140 .  DTD also says the suppression file supports both xpath and non-xpath, https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/suppressions_1_2_xpath_experimental.dtd#L8 .  This makes it seem like there is a parent-child relationship between the 2.  ### Are xpath suppressions a completely different type of suppressions and there is no similarity between them in hierarchy?  We store the filters in completely separate areas, https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/filters/SuppressionsLoader.java#L116-L121 .  Even if we load them all from a single file, only the specific filter for each will activate each type of suppression. Meaning if we only add `SuppressionXpathFilter` to a config, it will not suppress anything from the non-xpath suppressions. It requires the `SuppressionFilter` to be added for those.  The DTD also shows that not everything from non-xpath is pulled into xpath. We dropped lines and columns in xpath, and xpath has the unique field query.   This makes it seem more like there is no real parent-child relationship besides them both being a form of suppression. I would more closely say that xpath is tree's filter, while non-xpath is checker's filter.  ### 3rd option  Since there is always another option, is there a certain part that of suppressions that should be declared as parent/child and the other parts are actually customization of their respective walkers.

Such lines can only be taken from the HTML file.  An example of such lines is present over [here](https://vyom-yadav.github.io/DiffReport/pit-blocks-mod-1/index.html) (modified a bit for demonstrating).  Though uncovered lines will result in low line coverage, it is rounded up in certain cases ([example](https://vyom-yadav.github.io/DiffReport/pit-blocks-mod-single-line/index.html)) and the line coverage becomes 100% :( https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/issues/375   Mutations on lines that have no coverage are of type `NO_COVERAGE`, such mutations are **supported** by the XML report checker.  But it shouldn't be a problem as we have jacoco for line coverage and if there are multiple uncovered lines, then pitest line coverage will also drop and it will fail.  ---  The issue for XML report not containing information about uncovered lines is created at https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/issues/1059  ---  In some cases when the number of mutators is limited, some uncovered lines are also mutated and mutants are present in the XML report.

The `false` branches are no longer covered.   ## The problem The problem is that you need those ASTs staying on those first lines(`1`,`2` and `3`) to cover the `false` branches but in order to utilize inline configs, the configs need to be placed in the beginning of the file and therefore push the code down away from those first lines.","closed","","stoyanK7","2022-07-05T18:12:12Z","2022-07-05T18:33:21Z"

Making sure we have an issue.  It has become common that we have to rotate CIs when one becomes over bloated, one starts to have reliable issues, etc. all of which we have run into before.  We should group all our shell scripts by their activity instead of strictly putting it in the CI. For example, we should have script for regression, another for pitest (which we already do), etc...  Travis as one example still requires us to put commonds in shell. For the split we want, we should use a pattern similar to the below: ```` no-error-spring-cloud-gcp)   mvn -e --no-transfer-progress clean install -Pno-validations   ./.validation.sh no-error-spring-cloud-gcp ````  This way CI config and CI specific shell remove all CI specific commands, and under them there is group's shell script (validaiton.sh in this case) that try to be CI agnostic.","open","miscellaneous,","rnveach","2021-12-12T00:51:49Z","2021-12-12T22:09:41Z"

With one difference: JDK11 invokes `ExitHelper#exit` directly, JDK8 generates a helper method named `access$100`.  We need another way to test the `Main.main` method. One possibility is to replace `System#exit` with `Runtime#exit`.

Fast feedback form CI will be important in long run and will be super important for this summer's project.  The CDG Accelerator Plugin or the JUnit 5 Accelerator Plugin claims to improves mutation test performance by reducing the overhead in running tests that use a limited set of JUnit Jupiter features. Tests that use only these features will run more quickly, tests that use features outside this set will be executed as normal.  See https://docs.arcmutate.com/docs/accelerator.html#eligible-tests section for the eligible tests.  A license needs to be acquired in order to use the plugin, it is free for open-source projects.

A good example from this repo is google truth assertions:   **How I would like check to work:**   config:  ```xml                                                                           ```  input:   ```java import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertWithMessage; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;  public class TestClass {      @Test     void myTest() {         final String actual = ""some string"";         final String expected = ""some string"";         assertWithMessage(""some message"") // ok                 .that(actual)                 .isEqualTo(expected);          assertWithMessage(""some message"").that(actual).isEqualTo(expected); // violation, too many calls for single line chain         assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected); // ok by maxSingleLineCalls property         assertWithMessage(""some message"")                 .that(actual).isEqualTo(expected); // violation, chained method call should be wrapped }  ```  expected output:   ```bash  /var/tmp $ java $RUN_LOCALE -jar checkstyle-9.2-all.jar -c config.xml TestClass.java [ERROR] TestClass.java:14:8: Too many method calls on single line. [ChainedMethodCallWrap] [ERROR] TestClass.java:17:31: Chained method call should be wrapped. [ChainedMethodCallWrap]   ```  Note that check should have two messages.  **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** The problem is that no check/ combination of check and suppression easily allows enforcing of line wrapping chained method calls.   **Describe the solution you'd like** I would like a new check that accepts a method name pattern, so that common long chains of method calls (in assertions, builders, stream operations) can be validated for readability purposes.  ---------------------------------  I would like this check to have the following properties (ignore above example, and only consider the given code snippets):  `maxSingleLineCalls` : the maximum number of calls for a single line method call chain. Once we begin wrapping calls, this property has no effect, and number of calls per line is enforced by `callsPerLine` property.  Config:  ```xml                                          ```  Example:  ```java assertThat(thing1).equals(thing2);// ok, by maxSingleLineCalls  assertWithMessage(""message"") // ok         .that(thing1)         .equals(thing2);  assertWithMessage(""message"").that(thing1) // ok, callsPerLine default is 2         .equals(thing2);  assertWithMessage(""message"").that(thing1).equals(thing2); // 2 violations, too many calls for single line chain  ```  `callsPerLine`: this property sets the maximum number of method calls allowed on any given line of chained method calls once we begin line wrapping calls.   Config:   ```xml                                                     ```  Example:   ```java assertWithMessage(""message"") // ok         .that(thing1)         .equals(thing2);  assertWithMessage(""message"").that(thing1) // violation, chained method call should be wrapped         .equals(thing2);  assertWithMessage(""message"").that(thing1).equals(thing2); // 2 violations, too many calls for single line chain  ```  `identifierPattern` : this property would be used to specify regex by user of methods to check. User can specify any form of method invocation identifier, such as:  ```  . . ```  Check logic would work like this:  Generate complete method invocation identifier. This should be checked against given regex.  ```java public class Test {     void m() {         ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments) // yields ""ClassUtil.get""                 .setDate(date)                 .setTitle(title);          get(requiredArguments) // yields ""get""                 .setDate(date)                 .setTitle(title);     } }  ```  In either case, we generate identifier from first child of initial method call:  ``` ... METHOD_CALL -> ( [4:21]  |--DOT -> . [4:17]  |   |--IDENT -> ClassUtil [4:8]  |   `--IDENT -> get [4:18]  |--ELIST -> ELIST [4:22]  |   `--EXPR -> EXPR [4:22]  |       `--IDENT -> requiredArguments [4:22]  `--RPAREN -> ) [4:39] ... METHOD_CALL -> ( [8:11]  |--IDENT -> get [8:8]  |--ELIST -> ELIST [8:12]  |   `--EXPR -> EXPR [8:12]  |       `--IDENT -> requiredArguments [8:12]  `--RPAREN -> ) [8:29] ... ```   Config:  ```xml                      // covers any method from ClassUtil.java                                ```  Example:  ```java ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments) // ok         .setDate(date)         .setTitle(title);  ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments).setDate(date) // ok, by callsPerLine = 2         .setTitle(title);   ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments).setDate(date)         .setTitle(title).setTime(time) // ok, by callsPerLine = 2         .setOtherParameter(other);  ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments).setDate(date)         .setTitle(title).setTime(time).setOtherParameter(other) // violation, chained method call should be wrapped         .setSomeOtherParameter(someOther);  ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments).setDate(date)         .setTitle(title).setTime(time).setParameter(thing).setOtherParameter(other) // 2 violations, chained method call should be wrapped         .setSomeOtherParameter(someOther);  ClassUtil.get(requiredArguments).setDate(date).setTitle(title); // violation, too many calls for single line chain  get(requiredArguments) // ok         .setDate(date)         .setTitle(title)  ```    This initial implementation would not check imports in any way.","open","new module,","nick-mancuso","2021-12-21T18:19:12Z","2022-02-22T12:09:42Z"

It accepts only an array. What Java does for the developers to make coding easier is it sees and makes this simple conversion for you. >  > To make this conversion it actually instantiates an Object array for you and puts the arguments you are passing into the array and passes that to the method. In this case we are passing **2** strings to the `args`. So basically your simple `   javadocToken, getClass().getName()` in the source actually becomes `new Object[] {javadocToken, getClass().getName()}` or basically: > ```` > final Object[] temp = new Object[2]; > temp[0] = javadocToken; > temp[1] = getClass().getName(); > ```` >  > You all can start to see where the 2 comes into play here. It is the number of arguments being passed specifically to the `Object...`. >  > 3 is just the new value pitest is replacing 2 with to look and find some failure. IE: `new Object[2]` ==> `new Object[3]`. >  > If you actually embed the bytecode representation in the source and place it on an isolated line and run pitest, you will see the surviving mutant is only on this line and the rest of the code passes.","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-15T05:02:17Z","2022-07-15T05:16:16Z"

METHOD_DEF and LITERAL_SUPER.  The area in question in this code relies directly on the tokens brought forward to the visit check. So we can't show super is needed, regression showed nothing anyways. METHOD_DEF is not an issue and cannot be contributed to show such because we already have a specific section in the visit for METHOD_DEF and any that get to this section, we enough checks in `isSameNameMethod` that it basically has to be the super literal because we are looking for specific tokens with specific text that prevents us from matching something random.  I tried re-writting the code in addition to removing the existing code so it made more sense and satisfy pitest, Ex: ````         if (ast.getType() == TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF) {             if (isOverridingMethod(ast)) {                 methodStack.add(new MethodNode(ast));             }         }         else if (isSuperCall(ast)) { ```` but this increased the number of surviving mutations beyond the original report.

We need an input file with no package definition, and we need the class we are forbidding to match the current package plus the dot and the name of the class to forbid. Since the package doesn't exist, it is an empty string. This makes the class we need to forbid be `.` hence this test case. I went with `BadExample` to specially denote it. With the mutation in place, this causes an NPE to kill it.

"","11644","Issue #11604: allows 3rd parties to expand module identification","Issue #11604  Our current module identification process is very strict. This PR is to allow that to be loosened so 3rd parties can create their own sub-modules that our current one doesn't support.  To be sure to note, this is not changing `isValidCheckstyleClass`, which ensures classes we look at are `AutomaticBean`, not abstract, and a default constructor. That rule still must pass for all classes and cannot be overridden.  `DEFAULT_IDENTIFICATION_PREDICATE` shows our current identification process. This identification will allow 3rd party modules, but it will not support 3rd party children modules, IE: new Walker children.  Suppose I had created a new walker `XmlWalker` which extends `AbstractFileSetCheck` and I wanted it to allow children modules like `AbstractXmlCheck`. Checkstyle will recognize `XmlWalker` because of `AbstractFileSetCheck` but it will not identify anything extending `AbstractXmlCheck` even if follows the absolute same makeup as `AbstractCheck`. This is because we only recognize `AbstractCheck` and nothing else that could be a child module. There is no common class for module children. Our packages.xml file will not help here, because again, we still only pull in things that follow our defined class hierarchy.  With this new recognition, `PackageObjectFactory` will now be able to pick up these new children, once the new identification is added and treat them like they are any other module we have for Checkstyle.

Using `if (null == user) ` will be better, if you type `if (user = null) `, comiler will tell.  In Java7, Objects.isNull() or Objects.nonNull() is useful.  In this situation, I think we should use  Objects.isNull(user) in stead of `if (user == null)`.   In my team, we use linux shell script to check code to avoid xxx == null  / xxx != null / null == xxx / null != xxx.

"","11693","AnnotationsSortedAlphabetically: New Check to have all annotations sorted alphabetically","In Java it's considered a good practice to sort all imports alphabetically. IDEs have been doing that for a long time.   In our team we have some Coding Standards and one of them is also keeping the annotations in classes/fields/methods,... sorted alphabetically. There is no way we can do that automatically so in every merge request we need to manually check it and, as humans, sometimes we missed some of them. We would like to have a CheckStyle rule to enforce that the annotations are sorted alphabetically so the build can fail if not.  The name of the new Check could be *AnnotationsSortedAlphabetically*.  Given the following configuration:  ```xml  ```  With a class like:  ```java @SuppressWarnings(""foo"")  // invalid @Deprecated class Foo {    @Deprecated  // valid   @SuppressWarnings(""bar"")   public static void main(String[] args) {        } } ```  I envision the output like:  ``` ...

Using `getProperty` as a test will throw an exception if it is not found, so this requires try/catching the method for every call. This also has its own performance issues, especially when you have multiple configurations to scan.  There should either be a `containsProperty` method or `getProperty` should be less exception happy.","open","","rnveach","2022-05-14T13:24:13Z","2022-05-14T17:50:00Z"

Since _se.pkg1.pkgnotx_ is defined as THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE I think it should be in THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE group even though SPECIAL_IMPORTS is defined as _se.pkg1_ since matching against THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE is more specific than SPECIAL_IMPORTS.  Also SAME_PACKAGE(3) should not be relevant if they are in se.pkg1.pkgx.* only if they are in se.pkg1.*.   _A side note._ The example codebase is a bit weird where I have _se.pkg1.pkgx_ and _se.pkg1.pkgnotx_ in the same folder structure where _se.pkg1.pkgnotx_ is a dependency from maven, created from another part of my organization so for my team/application's point of view it's considered third party but I get the same behavior in this example codebase as in my regular codebase. ---","closed","","blindahl","2022-05-15T16:54:29Z","2022-06-07T04:35:31Z"

Please describe.** Since Java 8, Javadocs may *unofficially* contain `@implNote`, `@implSpec` and `@apiNote` tags, as explained in [this article](https://nipafx.dev/javadoc-tags-apiNote-implSpec-implNote/). Even though I wrote *unofficially*, the JDK documentation itself uses such tags, e.g. see the ""Implementation notes"" [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html#getOrDefault-java.lang.Object-V-). They were added in [JDK-8068562](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8068562). Android Studio, Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, Netbeans, Sublime Text (& possibly more) **support and suggest them**. Even though they are not officially standard, it is as if they were, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55150289/9481500). Checkstyle rejects them as `Unknown tag 'implNote'. [JavadocType]`. Note that this error only occurs for class javadocs, while for method javadocs even random unknown tags are accepted (see output above).  Some references: -   **Describe the solution you'd like** Since those tags are officially part of the Javadoc standard since Java 8, I think checkstyle should consider them as valid tags. The files that should probably be edited are: - Adding `IMPL_NOTE_LITERAL`, `IMPL_SPEC_LITERAL` and `API_NOTE_LITERAL` to the list at [JavadocLexer.g4:126](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/ec446e4c835dbfd1d86de08ead9bd92021a01487/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/javadoc/JavadocLexer.g4#L126) - Adding the same tags to the `isJavadocTag` method at [JavadocParser.g4:32](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/javadoc/JavadocParser.g4#L32)  ``` Starting audit...

"","11604","Remove some hardcoding of specifics so Checkstyle can be more Extensible","I am tired of Checkstyle limiting itself to mainly Java files. I am looking for checkstyle to support more different type of unique files (XML, Properties, etc..) by extending it at https://github.com/rnveach/checkstyle-extras .  In the process of setting this process up and starting it, it started to become apparent how limited Checkstyle was making itself. Configuration isn't really the issue, as it already supports 3rd party classes. It doesn't mind if a new walker or such is being added. But there are specific other, more newer additions, that is hindering the process and causing conflicts or extra code duplication.  The following (so far) is a list I have identified and looking to have loosen up so Checkstyle can support more. * Checkstyle's copyright on Java only support. ( https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/11596 ) * Tests only know `Checker` or `TreeWalker` and need some minor re-working to be able to override for newer ""walkers ( https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/11603 ) * Sub-modules of a module are not really supported, even though some areas are coded to provide this support ( https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/11644 ) * ASTs have no generic interface and implmentation that we have to duplicate utility code between our different types of nodes   * Creating a interface between all ASTs to start a synchronization process of common methods ( https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/11617 )   * Add methods like getting type, line and column number, iterating through children, etc.   * Create a commonality for `AstTreeStringPrinter` and possibly out Walker modules . * Suppressions is oddly coded for `Checker` or `TreeWalker` and has no idea of flexibility like configurations do.   * This lead to https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/11597 . * XPath is very `TreeWalker` specific and not flexible for other nodes   * Utility class is very strict when it doesn't need to be ( https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/11598 )   * XPath will be split between AST specific and generic classes ( https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/11617 ) * After all this, common functionality should be `abstract`ed out, to separate core functionality and walker specific functionality. This includes walkers, checks, xpath nodes, events, etc....  I am looking for these areas to change, not functionally, but in a way that makes way for extensibility by either Checkstyle itself or 3rd parties.","open","miscellaneous,","rnveach","2022-05-04T01:30:21Z","2022-06-06T00:49:56Z"

The task of this PR is to calculate the execution time of pitest alone (without setting up the environment in Github actions) and give that report to the maintainers of the plugin.  To calculate the time, create a `pitest-all` profile in local (with all classes present in all the different profiles). Run mutation coverage without the CDG accelerator plugin, and save the log (basically, the time elapsed).  Now run the same profile with the plugin, compare the diff, and report. If the mutation coverage does not take a lot of time (last time we tried the `pitest-all` profile, it took 12 hrs) make a PR, with that profile in a Github action.","open","approved,","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-09T20:05:06Z","2022-07-16T18:21:28Z"

You can find documentation for most old versions using a URL format like         https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/version/X.X where ""X.X"" is the version number.

We may merge both of these classes and extract it somewhere, there are some overlapping properties.  When #10968 will be merged, extract these methods to util and try to remove the suppression for `ExcessiveClassLength` in UnusedLocalVariableCheck.","closed","miscellaneous,","Vyom-Yadav","2022-01-16T07:30:42Z","2022-03-20T15:45:16Z"

The only difference is that it should be able to filter different file types(i.e. have `Checker` as parent module instead of `TreeWalker`) - `java`, `xml`, `js`, `properties`, `sql`, etc. It shoud have the following properties:  | Name      | Description | Default value | | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | | `commentFormat` | Specify comment pattern to trigger filter to begin suppression. | ""SUPPRESS CHECKSTYLE (\w+)"" | | `checkFormat` | Specify check pattern to suppress. | "".*"" | | `messageFormat` | Define message pattern to suppress. | null | | `idFormat` | Specify check ID pattern to suppress. | null | | `influenceFormat` | Specify negative/zero/positive value that defines the number of lines preceding/at/following the suppression comment. | ""0"" |  ## How it should work This is just an example config with 3 files to show what is expected. Configuration of properties should be the same as the above mentioned filter. Their behaviour is well-documented there. ### Config ```xml          	      	                                           ``` ### XML ```xml   // ok  // violation ``` #### Expected output ```bash $ java -jar checkstyle-all.jar -c config.xml file.xml [ERROR] file.xml:3:0: Line is longer than 2 characters (found 16).

The only test to execute a static initializer will be the first test to run that causes that class to load code in static initializer blocks is not re-run so the mutants have no effect. Pitest tries to avoid mutating static initializer code It will not create mutants in static initializers private methods called only from static initializers can also result in small differences between runs.

Line number 2. Type of mutation operator 3. Exact mutation applied  As it stands now, our surviving mutation suppression model for Pitest has some limitations:  1. It forces maintainer to go to report to find details 2. Allows suppression of multiple mutators in a single line  -------------------------------  I would like output more like this:  ``` ➜  checkstyle git:(master) ✗ kotlinc ./.ci/pitest.kt pitest-sizes  Surviving mutation found. Source File: ""ExecutableStatementCountCheck.java"" Class: ""com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.sizes.ExecutableStatementCountCheck"" Method: ""isContainerNode"" Line Number: 232 Line Contents: ""return TokenUtil.isOfType(node, TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF"" Mutator: org.pitest.mutationtest.engine.gregor.mutators.ReturnValsMutator Description: ""replaced return of integer sized value with (x == 0 ? 1 : 0)""  ```  This will make it easier for maintainers working on pitest issues to find exact mutation to hardcode and run diff report against. There would be no need to view the pitest report.  ------------------------------ I propose that we use kotlin or groovy (executed as a script) to create this suppression system, using the following high-level implementation:  1. Parse pitest XML report generated by pitest execution. We can pass exact maven pitest execution in as command line args to script. 2. Generate a POJO from each `mutation` node. This POJO should have an optional `source` field that will contain the line of source code that is being mutated (similar to existing solution). 3. Create a collection of all generated POJOs. 4. Remove killed mutations from collection. 5. Compare surviving mutations to existing collection of survivors, these can also be parsed from a set of existing custom XML reports from the initial run (these are checked into Github). We will need to create some form of ""fuzzy equals"" to determine if we have a match between collections. 6. Print diff to command line, in format proposed above.  This tool should have a way to print out mutation POJOs to a file as XML as our ""suppression"" list (see item 5 above) .  To achieve feature parity with current implementation, we should also have a ""flaky survivor"" collection.  Example of XML report:  ```  ExecutableStatementCountCheck.java com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.sizes.ExecutableStatementCountCheck isContainerNode (Lcom/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/DetailAST;)Z 232 org.pitest.mutationtest.engine.gregor.mutators.ReturnValsMutator 31 1 com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.sizes.ExecutableStatementCountCheckTest.[engine:junit-jupiter]/[class:com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.sizes.ExecutableStatementCountCheckTest]/[method:testVisitTokenWithWrongTokenType()] replaced return of integer sized value with (x == 0 ? 1 : 0)    ```  This system has the advantage of not requiring maintainers to look at the reports at all; all relevant information is shown on the command line or in CI. This will speed up the mutation killing process since we will have many to deal with soon.   ---------------------- Comparison between surviving mutations is based on how we define `equals()` in our `Mutation` POJO. We cannot use line/ column number for equals, as this may shift around.  I propose we define `equals()` as the following properties being the same:  1. Source file 2. Mutated class 3. Mutated Method 4. Mutator 5. Block (this is block of instructions, roughly each `{}`) 6. Description 8. Line Contents  This may not be enough information to differentiate between mutations, however. We may need to do use the HTML report to generate POJOs and get the exact line of code from the source file OR get file contents/ exact line in script.","closed","miscellaneous,","nick-mancuso","2022-05-22T14:50:39Z","2022-06-25T13:25:00Z"

Because of this, both test areas should change their test make up based on their respective testing pattern.  This is planned to be test/it only changes, nothing in `main` will change. It also will be a multi-PR work (4 PRs are planned).  =============  Examples:  Google and Sun does regression on an existing configuration. They do not create modules from memory or scan existing modules.

"","11193","Performance Issue with Javadoc Grammar","Consider a simple javadoc (no tags, inline tags, HTML elements, etc.) like the following, which is taken from https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/b26361760cefb540ac625702ea8639b0c5767107/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/JavaAstVisitorTest.java:  ```java     /**      * If a visit method is not overridden, we should explain why we do not 'visit' the      * parse tree at this node and construct an AST. Reasons could include that we have      * no terminal symbols (tokens) in the corresponding production rule, or that      * we handle the construction of this particular AST in it's parent node. If we      * have a production rule where we have terminal symbols (tokens), but we do not build      * an AST from tokens in the rule context, the rule is extraneous.      */  ```  Here are some statistics from using our ANTLR Javadoc grammar to parse this javadoc:  ``` Input size: 518 char, 8 lines Number of tokens: 476 Parse time (ms): 281.922 Prediction time (ms): 256.538 = 91.00% Lookahead burden: 15439/476 = 32.43 Deepest lookahead: k = 87  ```  With Checkstyle's javadoc grammar, this one javadoc contains 400 ambiguities and 423 predicates (all are invocations of `isNextJavadocTag()`). We can also see that the lookahead burden is significant. This statistic is found by dividing the total number of lookahead symbols examined while parsing the entire input by the total number of tokens parsed. The large number of tokens parsed is due to manner in which text is handled; individual characters are sent from the lexer to the parser, via TokenStream. The characters are then essentially ""lexed"" again, in the `text` production rule:  ```antlr  text : ((CHAR | WS)  {   _la = _input.LA(1);   if ((_la != WS) && (_la != CHAR)) return _localctx;   else if (_alt == 1) continue;  }        )+;  ```  This results in a very large parse tree of individual characters, and very poor performance. Example of generated parse tree:  ``` ... [@7,15:15='I',,2:7] [@8,16:16='f',,2:8] [@9,17:17=' ',,2:9] [@10,18:18='a',,2:10] [@11,19:19=' ',,2:11] [@12,20:20='v',,2:12] [@13,21:21='i',,2:13] [@14,22:22='s',,2:14] [@15,23:23='i',,2:15] [@16,24:24='t',,2:16] ... ```  Here is a visual example of how our grammar tokenizes this input:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31252532/149449032-77637b2f-9e15-44b1-8b5a-8c99578ff99e.png)  Ideally, some sort of `TEXT` token should be emitted from the lexer, so that we do not have to deal with giant parse trees and re-lexing characters in the parser. In this case, the example javadoc's token stream would consist of about 20-30 tokens.   Another issue that could be affecting performance is the large number of semantic predicates (such as `{!isNextJavadocTag()}?`) on the left hand side of parser rules. When a semantic predicate appears on the LHS of a rule, this particular rule or alternative is not cached.  --------------------------  For comparison, here is the stats for the same javadoc, parsed by the ANTLR javadoc grammar:  ``` Input size: 518 char, 8 lines Number of tokens: 190 Parse time (ms): 36.79 Prediction time (ms): 34.672 = 94.24% Lookahead burden: 5704/190 = 30.02 Deepest lookahead: k = 187  ```  The ANTLR4 grammar parses this javadoc almost 8 times faster than Checkstyle's javadoc grammar. It contains 169 ambiguities and 0 predicates (all of ANTLR's parser grammars are action free).  ---------------------------  Also for comparison, here is the statistics from our java grammar for parsing the entire input (including comments) at https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/b26361760cefb540ac625702ea8639b0c5767107/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/JavaAstVisitorTest.java:  ``` Input size: 8664 char, 193 lines Number of tokens: 806 Parse time (ms): 222.904 Prediction time (ms): 204.465 = 91.73% Lookahead burden: 4558/806 = 5.66 Deepest lookahead: k = 173  ```  -------------------------  To see an example of slowed parsing in practice, please read http://roman-ivanov.blogspot.com/2016/02/performance-problem-while-using-checks.html. Here is some of the important stats from this blog post:  >Execution test that show performance degradation in 15 times (19sec vs 5m8sec):  ``` $ grep -E ""JavadocTagContinuationIndentation|NonEmptyAtclauseDescription|SingleLineJavadoc|JavadocParagraph|SummaryJavadoc|AtclauseOrder|AbstractJavadoc"" google_checks.xml                                                        $ grep -E ""JavadocTagContinuationIndentation|NonEmptyAtclauseDescription|SingleLineJavadoc|JavadocParagraph|SummaryJavadoc|AtclauseOrder|AbstractJavadoc"" google_checks_only-one-javadoc-check.xml           $ grep -E ""JavadocTagContinuationIndentation|NonEmptyAtclauseDescription|SingleLineJavadoc|JavadocParagraph|SummaryJavadoc|AtclauseOrder"" google_checks_no-javadoc-checks.xml $  $ time java -jar checkstyle-6.15-all.jar -c google_checks_no-javadoc-checks.xml guava/ Starting audit...

That would obviously trigger the `CommentsIndentation` rule, so I have to suppress it in those code portions.  `SuppressionCommentFilter` seems quite fitting for the purpose, as it maps just a couple of comment patterns as filter bounds; the PROBLEM here is that, whilst rule suppression _includes_ the opening comment (so-called offComment), it _excludes_ the closing comment (so-called onComment). Considering that _the Eclipse formatter honors BOTH tag comments (it doesn't format either)_, it would seem legit to expect a corresponding behavior from checkstyle (that is, the closing comment should be included in the suppression too).","open","","stechio","2022-04-03T12:19:41Z","2022-04-03T13:18:49Z"

The PROBLEM, as shown in the error output above, is that, ***if a property is overridden*** (in my example, [`TypeName.format`](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_naming.html#TypeName)), ***its unspecified attributes (such as `default`) are undefined***, contrary to their documented initial state. The documentation declares that the default value of `TypeName.format` is `""^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$""`, yet it seems lost... The [property expansion documentation](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config.html#Properties) suggests to define the `default` attribute ""when a property in the value cannot be resolved"":  ```xml       . . .  ```  This way, the processor is finally happy, but I'm NOT, since to me, as a fan of the DRY principle, it feels like an awkward redundancy (why repeating the SAME default value, when it should be, implicitly, already there?).  ---  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR  Probably I'm missing some design principle/convention informing this project, nonetheless IMO inheriting the predefined behavior is a common expectation in modern systems: if the default value of `TypeName.format` is `""^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$""`, ***when I override that property I expect its default value to be still there, until I explicitly redefine it***.","open","","stechio","2022-04-11T12:15:48Z","2022-04-12T08:35:30Z"

Using the current implementation, I've found cases where around 30% of the time is spent inside of the stream logic (see screenshot). I have tested that a simple naive implementation reduces this to almost 0%.   Note; this is not a full-benchmark from start-to-end as I stopped it after +/- 120 seconds. So the time spent inside of `isOfType` took 30% of the first 120 seconds of running Checkstyle (quite a lot...), which using the naive implementation dropped to near 0. If it is desired, I could look into doing further benchmarks to give more precise and definitive answers regarding the exact effect, but I hope this issue at least shows a naive implementation is more advantageous in general.

Updates `antlr4-runtime` from 4.9.3 to 4.10  Release notes Sourced from antlr4-runtime's releases.  4.10 Major feature, code clean up, and bug fix release ANTLR version 4.10 This is a very major release with a number of important changes. There have been many valuable contributions, but I welcome @​KvanTTT and @​jcking as recent ""official"" major ANTLR contributors. :) WARNING:  Generated 4.10 lexers and parsers are incompatible with code generated by previous versions of ANTLR. You must regenerate all of your code from grammars to use the new runtime. This is true of all targets (except probably javascript). Repo branching structure We have changed the branching structure of the repository. The default branch for this repo remains master and it is the latest stable release with tags for the various releases; e.g., see release tag 4.9.3.  We now do development work in branch dev between releases and all pull requests should be derived from that branch. The dev branch is merged back into master to cut a release and the release state is tagged (e.g., with 4.10-rc.1 or 4.10.) Visually our process looks roughly like this:  Targets such as Go that pull directly from the repository can use the default master branch but can also pull from the active dev branch: $ go get github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr@dev  Developers certificate of origin In order to bring ANTLR more in line with current standard standards for contribution processes, as of 4.10, ANTLR uses the Linux Foundation's Developer Certificate of Origin, DCO, version 1.1. See file https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/raw/master/developer-cert-of-origin.txt . It is simpler than the original contributors license agreement, which required programmers to sign the contributors.txt file, which has now moved to file historical-contributors-agreement.txt . Each commit in pull requests must have a ""signature"", which is simple as using -s (not -S) on the git commit command: $ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'  Github's pull request process enforces the sig and gives instructions on how to fix any commits that lack the sig. See https://github.com/apps/dco for more info. 4.10-generated parsers incompatible with previous runtimes ANTLR not only generates recursive-descent parsers; it generates a state machine called an augmented transition network (ATN) in serialized form as a bunch of integers stored in the generated parser and lexer files. This serialization format was changed for 4.10 to remove a size limit on the supported ATNs. See antlr/antlr4#3591. The key point here is that we changed the version number stored inside the serialization format and so, in order to use this new version of ANTLR, you must regenerate all of your lexers and parsers using the 4.10 tool and then use the new runtime. Parsers generated with 4.10 or not compatible with previous versions of the runtime. Increasing minimum java version Going forward, we are using Java 11 for the source code and the compiled .class files for the ANTLR tool. The Java runtime target, however, and the associated runtime tests use Java 8 (bumping up from Java 7). JavaScript target The JS target has been substantially reworked. Miscellaneous improvements  Lexer rules can use the caseInsensitive option now. Improved error messages We rebuilt the runtime testing rig and made continuous integration improvements; part of this was done to support more recent versions of Java    ...

Spotbugs-maven-plugin 4.4.2.1 Release  Reworked version string to account for any patches we need to make to plugin that would otherwise case a diverge from spotbugs or require us to wait.  This is similar to how other plugins approach this such as lombok.  The first 3 positions are reserved for the alignment with spotbugs.  The last position is for our patch revision level.  Normally this would be '0' but given we released 4.4.2 already, it made sense to denote '1' so that it was clear there was a difference. This patch release addresses issues with resolution of the maven dependencies that resulted in a few regression libraries that had vulnerabilities. This patch further changed lowest maven from 3.2.5 to 3.3.9 but reality is that even 3.3.9 likely doesn't work.  Since all maven before 3.8.1 are vulnerable, most should be there.  If not, let us know.  Future releases will raise that revision number up.

Release notes Sourced from pitest-maven's releases.  1.9.3  #1052 - Support maven argLine property and single string argLines #1054 - Provide control over auto addition of -Djava.awt.headless=true #1055 - Option to autoset number of threads #1056 - Set timeout for socket communication #1058 - Set defaults for input and output encoding for programmatic api  1054 Moves support of auto adding headless=true (to prevent keyboard focus being stolen on Macs) into a feature. It is enabled by default, but can be disabled by adding -MACOS_FOCUS to the features string. 1055 adds the option to guess the appropriate number of threads for the current machine by adding +auto_threads the features string. This option is disabled by default and designed for local use. It is not recommended for use on a CI server.

Release notes Sourced from archunit-junit5's releases.  ArchUnit 0.23.0 Breaking Changes  As mentioned in Enhancements/Core ArchRules will now by default reject evaluating if the set passed to the should-clause is empty. This will break existing rules that don't check any elements in their should-clause. You can restore the old behavior by setting the ArchUnit property archRule.failOnEmptyShould=false  Bug Fixes  Fix wrong origins of JavaCall in case of bridge methods. If a class had two methods with the exact same name and parameter types the origin of a JavaCall was picked randomly from them. It now always picks the non-synthetic method (see #513) Fix non-deterministic return value of JavaCodeUnit.getMethod(). In case of bridge methods there might be more than one method matching the exact same name and parameters. In these cases the result of getMethod() was random. It now always picks the non-synthetic method (see #256) layeredArchitecture() will now allow to combine mayOnlyBeAccessedBy... and mayOnlyAccess.... Previously mayOnlyAccess... would forbid all incoming dependencies (see #739; thanks a lot to @​hankem)  Enhancements Core  Members targeted by AccessTarget are now resolved like the Java Reflection API would do it. Previously AccessTarget.resolve() would return a set of matching members, the new replacement AccessTarget.resolveMember() returns an optional member making it a lot easier to handle (see #722) JavaClass now knows its methodReferencesFromSelf (e.g. Object::toString) and constructorReferencesFromSelf (e.g. Object::new) (see #215; thanks a lot to @​KorSin) ArchRules will now by default reject evaluating if the set passed to the should-clause is empty. This prevents implementation errors like picking a package in that()... that doesn't even exist and thus composing a rule that doesn't check anything (compare the user guide; see #774; thanks a lot @​oberprah) The automatic import dependency resolution now resolves classes missing from the import that are only referenced  as class object (e.g. Foo.class) in a throws clause (e.g. someMethod() throws FooException) in an instanceof check (e.g. obj instanceof Foo) as an array component type (e.g. Foo[] array;) as an annotation parameter (e.g. @SomeAnnotation(type = Foo.class)) as part of a generic type signature (e.g. List<? extends Foo>) Furthermore, the resolution behavior can now be tweaked to resolve deeper or not resolve at all. Thus, users can decide between resolving additional types and performance (compare the user guide; see #728)   New predefined ImportOption to exclude package-info.class files (see #793; thanks a lot to @​TomerFi)  Lang  Analogously to classes(), there now exists a method members()...should().containNumberOfElements(predicate) (see #179; thanks a lot to @​oberprah)  Library  PlantUmlArchCondition now rejects files that don't specify any components at all or are of an invalid format (see #735; thanks a lot to @​pfichtner)  JUnit  Tests can now be run if their classes are loaded by the context ClassLoader instead of the ArchUnit ClassLoader (see #781; thanks a lot to @​stuartwdouglas) New method Class<?> FieldSource.getJavaClass() to retrieve the declaring class of the respective field (see #800; thanks a lot to @​famod)  Further Acknowledgement  thanks a lot to @​marknp for improving the Javadoc on ArchConditions (see #725) thanks a lot to @​timtebeek for making the ArchUnit build work with JDK 17 (see #779)     Commits  1e579c3 prepare release 0.23.0 8f56568 allow releasing to Maven Central in release.sh 1961f27 adjust expected POM files 93a2f8a add news articles about past events f7903d7 adjust expected JUnit Platform POM 1a55203 adjust Asciidoctor plugin to new Gradle version 5323977 Add javaClass to FieldSource #800 d9d1aec Add javaClass to FieldSource df3a034 Add predefined ImportOption to exclude package-info.class files #794 432589d add predefined ImportOption to exclude package-info.class files Additional commits viewable in compare view      [![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit5&package-manager=maven&previous-version=0.22.0&new-version=0.23.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)  Dependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Please format it by running mvn tidy:pom.` We ended up skipping the process and continuing on with the releases. However, that would be a mistake as after releasing 10.3.1, it was determined backport users couldn't use checkstyle as they were getting a bad POM with no dependencies.  **Problem:** After some digging, @nick-mancuso found the problem to be maven-shade. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-321 . `createDependencyReducedPom` wasn't being respected in maven-shade. Unbeknownst to us when they fixed it, maven-shade was actually putting the reduced pom as our deployed pom. The bug was fixed in 3.3.0 of maven-shade, and checkstyle upgraded maven-shade to 3.3.0 in 10.2 . Tidy was complaining as it was going against the reduced POM instead of the actual POM. So fixing maven-shade also fixed the tidy issue.  **Final:** This is currently not a known issue in checkstyle's release. When doing `package -Passembly` in checkstyle, it is creating a `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` in the root folder of checkstyle. This change will atleast stop that random file being created during that goal, but this change is also being done to make to ensure it doesn't become an issue like in backport. We don't want the reduced POM now anyways so it is nothing we are missing.  Fix found by @nick-mancuso","closed","miscellaneous,","rnveach","2022-07-01T14:12:39Z","2022-07-03T12:23:44Z"

A variable will always be declared in a block (`{ }`), a variable declaration is not allowed in `if` blocks or other statements without `{ }` , something like ```java if(someCondition)     int a = 12; ``` will give a compilation error.  Also for variables declared in loops, the variable `int i` above, `currentAst` can not be `RCURLY` ever and the loop will stop when `currentAst` is null.  So it is safe to remove this condition.  ---  ### Generating reports again:  Diff Regression config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/98dceb63a79f4833e85fff9b2e1464a6/raw/1538ad39a090a627ff99ef5436bda5ca090835b9/my_checks.xml Report label: validateBetweenScopesFalse","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-22T15:56:19Z","2022-07-27T08:47:33Z"

This condition is redundant as the upcoming conditions make sure that it can be only `PARAMETER_DEF` that can change the result of the method.  The upcoming conditions- ```java if (method.getType() == TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF) {     final DetailAST mods = method.findFirstToken(TokenTypes.MODIFIERS);     result = mods.findFirstToken(TokenTypes.ABSTRACT) != null; } ``` Now out of 4, only `PARAMETER_DEF` and `VARIABLE_DEF` can have `METHOD_DEF` as grand-parent. But as `abstract` methods cannot have a body, there is no way to define a variable. So the condition `result = mods.findFirstToken(TokenTypes.ABSTRACT) != null;` will always be false for it.  ---  ### Generating reports again:  Diff Regression config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/98dceb63a79f4833e85fff9b2e1464a6/raw/83a590e5527986641be5c31f0313eb2d2678b268/my_checks.xml Report label: ignoreAbstractMethodsTrue","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-07T13:42:52Z","2022-07-09T18:28:22Z"

A variable declared in static block scope, will always have an enclosing `CLASS_FRAME`.  In the current logic, we skip all frames of type `BLOCK_FRAME`, and `FOR_FRAME` to reach the `CLASS_FRAME`, if we can't reach `CLASS_FRAME` (maybe `METHOD_FRAME` is in between), then we can be assured that there is no static block present.  So if there is a static block, we will surely go into the branch `if (variableDeclarationFrame.getType() == FrameType.CLASS_FRAME)` in which we check for the condition- ```java staticContext = codeBlockDefinition.getType() == TokenTypes.STATIC_INIT     || modifiers.findFirstToken(TokenTypes.LITERAL_STATIC) != null; ``` Hence the line can be safely removed, in theory, we would take a hit in TC, as we would make another traversal in `getCodeBlockDefinitionToken(..)` but in reality, there will be no difference, in real case use scenario, 2-3 more iterations.  --- ### Generating reports again: Diff Regression config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/98dceb63a79f4833e85fff9b2e1464a6/raw/5dc88b466a50335d5759f60c1d041a239f11a5a1/my_checks.xml Diff Regression projects: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/91807e6244cff60698d9e33e32ba2d51/raw/ccf3b6b9e053f27b371eb6d1e848d7199dd1f567/projects-to-test-on.properties Report label: validateOnlyOverlappingFalseWithoutOpenJDK","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-06-29T06:46:51Z","2022-07-01T10:59:22Z"

If this was true i.e. `prevSibling` and `currentStatement` aren't on same line, we would do the above mentioned change.  Now this change occurs even if `prevSibling` and `currentStatement` are on the same line, in that case, this change doesn't make a difference because we only use `currentStatement`'s line number. So it is the same for it and its `prevSibling`. Hence this statement was redundant.    ---  ### Generating reports again: Diff Regression config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/98dceb63a79f4833e85fff9b2e1464a6/raw/67cdc192dee1963f831843ceed5c9e200d21987f/my_checks.xml  Diff Regression projects: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/contribution/master/checkstyle-tester/latest-projects-to-test-on.properties  Report label: treatTryResourcesAsStatementTrueDefaultProjects","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-03T20:30:24Z","2022-07-12T02:43:08Z"

This condition is redundant as the upcoming conditions make sure that it can be only `PARAMETER_DEF` that can change the result of the method.  The upcoming conditions- ```java final DetailAST parametersAST = ast.getParent(); final DetailAST methodAST = parametersAST.getParent(); if (parametersAST.getChildCount() == 1     && methodAST.getType() == TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF     && isSetterMethod(methodAST, name)) {         isIgnoredSetterParam = true; } ``` Now out of 4 only, `PARAMETER_DEF` and `VARIABLE_DEF` can have `METHOD_DEF` as grand-parent. `VARIABLE_DEF` will also fail to satisfy the condition `parametersAST.getChildCount() == 1`. AST will help to understand this. ``` METHOD_DEF -> METHOD_DEF   |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS   |   `--LITERAL_PUBLIC -> public   |--TYPE -> TYPE   |   `--LITERAL_VOID -> void   |--IDENT -> method   |--LPAREN -> (   |--PARAMETERS -> PARAMETERS   |--RPAREN -> )   `--SLIST -> {        |--VARIABLE_DEF -> VARIABLE_DEF       |   |--MODIFIERS -> MODIFIERS       |   |--TYPE -> TYPE        |   |   `--LITERAL_INT -> int       |   |--IDENT -> ab       |   `--ASSIGN -> =       |       `--EXPR -> EXPR       |           `--NUM_INT -> 12       |--SEMI -> ;       `--RCURLY -> } ```  As soon as we introduce `VARIABLE_DEF`, the number of children of its parent increases to `3`, which fails the condition.  ---  ### Generating reports again: Diff Regression config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/98dceb63a79f4833e85fff9b2e1464a6/raw/e0470443cc49f5f6f9b4849340a2c8c241693ffb/my_checks.xml Report label: setterCanReturnItsClassAndIgnoreSetter","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-07T12:40:13Z","2022-07-11T13:01:56Z"

Now there can be a case when `loop1 == null` and `loop2 == null` which will make this method return `true` as `loop1 == loop2` when it earlier returned `false`.   The method `isInTheSameLoop(..)` will return `true` in that condition when earlier it returned `false`. The reason why this won't make any difference depends on its usage. https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/7bc872ed83b4de5779cfb496ed0d0878ae303914/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/coding/FinalLocalVariableCheck.java#L676-L679 Earlier when `isInTheSameLoop(..)` returned `false`, `!isUseOfExternalVariableInsideLoop(..)` (note the **!**)  returned `true`(due to `loop2 == null`) so overall the if statement resulted `true`. Now when `isInTheSameLoop(..)` returns `true` for the same case, it won't make a difference.  Both the methods had overlapping conditions, it was extracted to a single condition, which is what it is in the current PR.   ---  ### Generating reports again:  Diff Regression config: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/98dceb63a79f4833e85fff9b2e1464a6/raw/b6cf9595bf1c29d308be0677128ed9f1e760d07b/my_checks.xml Diff Regression projects: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Vyom-Yadav/91807e6244cff60698d9e33e32ba2d51/raw/c7d0fc6900b7c10681be2f69147ea60429860c79/projects-to-test-on.properties Report label: validateEnhancedForLoopVariableTrueWithParameterDefWithoutOpenJDK","closed","","Vyom-Yadav","2022-07-09T10:53:21Z","2022-07-13T03:47:11Z"

"","11603","Some reworking for test structures","#11604  First commit is a simple synchronize between Test and IT where similar code is.  Second commit is the bigger change. I reworked how we build the Checker tree so it is more streamlined and not passing around the enumeration. `createChecker` will now handle the current given module and identify if it needs a TreeWalker or other similar intermediary between it and the module. It also removed random config names and more closely used the ones they represent.  I could not make similar changes to the IT side as the IT side has some weird complexities that need to be dealt with. We pass the name of the check and not the full class. We have to pull things from an existing config, and we only do partial pulls, still rebuild the missing pieces. There are also some tests that pull in more information from the config to not duplicate it making it all very complicated and needing its own rewrite.  I at least removed and centralized the code for `getModuleConfig` and `getModuleConfigs` for IT.","closed","","rnveach","2022-05-03T23:30:29Z","2022-05-15T13:55:42Z"

"","11916","Add paragraph to show configuration for real time scanning with CheckStyle-IDEA plugin","### Description Currently, the website has this [Inspections](https://checkstyle.org/idea.html#Inspections) paragraph on how to set up Intellij IDEA inspections for Checkstyle development, which works okay in my opinion. However, at the end of the day I find myself running `mvn clean verify` before submitting a pull request and it is really disappointing having to wait 15 minutes just to get an error from `ant-phase-verify` about line length violation or some small indentation error that the current `config/intellij-idea-inspections.xml` cannot pick up but the maven task picks up using `checkstyle_checks.xml`.  ### My proposal You know about [CheckStyle-IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea) and it would be nice showing it can be configured to use `checkstyle_checks.xml` for real time code scanning. I believe it should be suggested more instead of the current configuration on the website.","closed","","stoyanK7","2022-07-18T16:49:02Z","2022-07-20T14:52:18Z"
"","11475","Unit tests for Checkstyle GUI components","## Issue Checkstyle has minimalist graphical interface, used by developers for troubleshooting and research purpose. This feature is not important, and has no much support. There is no tests for GUI in Checkstyle (except for the model). And there is a reason for this. GUI tests require a physical display and exclusive access to input interfaces. As a result, it is possible to break the GUI after some refactoring. See #9004 for example.  ## Idea However, this can be done with [caciocavallo](https://github.com/CaciocavalloSilano/caciocavallo), a pure virtual AWT driver. With Cacio, all GUI windows are invisible and untouchable. This means that we can use it in CI and on the developer's PC without distracting the user with unexpected pop-ups.  ## Restrictions - The behavior of AWT components depends on the toolkit. On Mac, Linux and Windows, anything may be different. And, of course, it will be something different for the virtual toolkit. So it is **impossible** to gain 100% coverage for GUI: we need, for example, some lines of Windows-specific code and such code can be tested only on Windows. - Another restriction is *modal dialogs*: all of them should be *mocked* to prevent hanging of tests.  ## Result The goal of this issue is to set up initial configuration for GUI tests and write tests for some components to validate this approach. The improvement of GUI coverage should be done in other issues.","closed","CI,","pbludov","2022-03-27T15:14:23Z","2022-04-05T18:26:27Z"
