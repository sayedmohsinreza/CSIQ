"","8186","[Enhancement] Bump grpc and protobuff version to allow building on Mac M1","Upgrade to the latest grpc-java 1.42.1 which is only compatible and [tested against](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/8551#discussion_r714182190) 3.17.2, but we can assume that 3.17.3 (which has osx-aarch_64 compatible maven artifacts) is save to use.  We could have also upgrade to the latest grpc-java 1.42.1 and latest protoc 3.19.1, but it can not be directly done, it needs to tweak the grpcs-java internal dependencies. So we choose the safest option and discarded this option because of the following reasons:  - Protoc 3.19.1 generates code that relies on methods not available in protobuf-java 3.17.2 ([“issue”](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9236#issue-1059594027)) (which java-grpc relies on). So we need to tell grpc-java via dependency management to use 3.19.1 instead of 3.17.2.  ` are meant to be replaced by you, e.g. , .

"","8193","Introduce the Customized ALS Protocol for Satellite","I am working on improving the performance of transparent message transmission for the [skywalking-satellite](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-satellite) project.  Then I realize the  ALS protocol needed to operate the stream on each identity stream message. The satellite needs more resources and time. This is especially true when envoys are high in number.   Here is a performance test, using `2300` envoy instances are used to transparently transmit ALS messages to OAP through satellite, at a rate of `2.3K+` QPS. Then the satellite memory is full and not stable.  satellite so11y: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3417650/143766374-75714a27-cfd1-4fb7-983a-b17e02e51e37.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3417650/143766386-9c6cc432-7256-41e3-9ffe-5c51ea88d196.png)  OAP so11y(cluster): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3417650/143766407-854561ed-3ca8-41c8-a5df-460a10ecec5c.png)  I have tried to cache the stream on the satellite side, but more resources are wasted due to resource preemption. So I think we could dependency on the gRPC streaming messages are order feature, using the same stream to send cross identity messages.   After that, I did a test in this way, and the efficiency of sending ALS messages to OAP was improved, and the memory queue of the satellite was more stable.  This new protocol is copied from ALS and will only be called by the satellite.  Here have some screenshots to see the effect after optimization.

"","7766","IoTDB storage plugin","Hi, I am a participant in [Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/homepage). [Here](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/prodetail/210070771) is my project homepage. Now I have finished my project under the guidance of @jixuan1989 from IoTDB and @wu-sheng from Skywalking. However, I still have much work to do. This PR will help me find more bug and deficiencies of my work.  I have written a [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44023810/article/details/120555823) to introduce the design of IoTDB storage plugin.  This is a large module for Skywalking. I wrote more than 5 thousand source code lines and comment lines. They contains the core code and unit tests. When I wrote the code, I took the other storage plugin as a reference.  IoTDB doesn't have the index concept. In order to index some fields, I store the value of the index as a node of the storage path. Those nodes in storage path will be stored in the memory, so they serve as index. Eventually the data from the same table is spread across multiple devices. But IoTDB does not support cross-device query well. When I need use aggregation query (e.g. `max`, `avg`, `sum`), sort query (e.g. `order by`) or pagination query (e.g. `limit`, `offset`), I have to use a violence method that query all data meets the condition and then sort, aggregate or paginate them.  Although I have run and tested this IoTDB storage plugin locally, I know it is not enough and it need e2e tests at least. Hope you review my work and give me some suggestions.  - [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).","closed","complexity:high,","LIU-WEI-git","2021-09-22T08:06:44Z","2021-11-27T01:04:23Z"

When I try the configuration below to set different consumer group for oap server, it doesn't work. Still the default group in the program.  ```yaml kafka-fetcher:   selector: ${SW_KAFKA_FETCHER:default}   default:     bootstrapServers: ${SW_KAFKA_FETCHER_SERVERS:192.168.101.1:9092}     ......     kafkaConsumerConfig:       enable.auto.commit: true       group.id: test-group-mysql ```  The reason is that there is an order problem when setting in the code:  ```java properties = new Properties(); properties.putAll(config.getKafkaConsumerConfig()); properties.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, config.getGroupId()); properties.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, config.getBootstrapServers()); ```  I don't know if this is by design or a mistake in itself.

Revert the following changes in 8.9.0's PR #8066 ____ Optimize metrics of minute dimensionality persistence. - The value of metrics, which has declaration of the default value and current value equals the default value logically, the whole row wouldn't be pushed into database. - Add self-observability `metrics_persistence_skipped` metric to measure the number of skipped metrics. - SLA(percent function), Apdex, AvgLong(MAL mostly) metrics are mostly optimized because of this. Such as a full-failing error(0% successful rate) and unhealthy(apdex=0) are not costing the storage. - Hour/Day dimensionalities metrics are not changed, as they cover long duration. - Fix `max` function in OAL doesn't support negative long. ____  This optimization makes a side-effect, reported by @toffentoffen, the typical use case is shown in the demo env. ![Screenshot 2022-07-12 at 11 39 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/178534028-137a9494-f9cf-4d92-9d47-35c7c45e261d.png)  This service has only 66% success rate, but when you read the endpoint success rate list(DESC order), you can only see all are 100%. This is very confusing.  **The root cause** is the above optimization, if an entity(in this case, an endpoint)'s success rate is 0%, the metric is not persistent. Then when we do topN aggregation query, there is no available data to list, even its success rate is pretty low. Meanwhile, if you query in hour/day level, it would show up, which makes ppl more confusing.  So, to keep things simpler, and as the success rate is the only metric that could be optimized through this PR, I am going to revert this optimization, and keep all aggregated metrics in the storage consistently.","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2022-07-12T15:51:41Z","2022-07-13T09:13:06Z"

Enhance OAL engine core * Fix `funcParamExpression` and `literalExpression` can't be used in the same aggregation function. * Support cast statement in the OAL core engine. * Support `(str->long)` and `(long)` for string to long cast statement. * Support `(str->int)` and `(int)` for string to int cast statement. * Support Long literal number in the OAL core engine. * Support literal `string` as parameter of aggregation function. * Add `attributeExpression` and `attributeExpressionSegment` in the OAL grammar tree to support `map` type for the   attribute expression.  Besides added UTs, I locally added this OAL script ``` mq_consume_latency = from((str->long)Service.tag[""transmission.latency""]).longAvg();  mq_consume_latency = from((long)Service.tag[""transmission.latency""]).longAvg(); ```  In OAL debug mode(`SW_OAL_ENGINE_DEBUG=Y`), I can see this method generated in the dispatcher ```java     private void doMqConsumeLatency(Service var1) {         MqConsumeLatencyMetrics var2 = new MqConsumeLatencyMetrics();         var2.setTimeBucket(var1.getTimeBucket());         var2.setEntityId(var1.getEntityId());         var2.combine(Long.parseLong(var1.getTag(""transmission.latency"")), (long)1);         MetricsStreamProcessor.getInstance().in(var2);     } ```  Another test in filter expression. ``` mq_consume_latency = from((str->long)Service.tag[""transmission.latency""]).filter((str->long)tag[""transmission.latency""] > 0L).longAvg(); ``` ```     private void doMqConsumeLatency(Service var1) {         if ((new GreaterMatch()).match(Long.parseLong(var1.getTag(""transmission.latency"")), 0L)) {             MqConsumeLatencyMetrics var2 = new MqConsumeLatencyMetrics();             var2.setTimeBucket(var1.getTimeBucket());             var2.setEntityId(var1.getEntityId());             var2.combine(Long.parseLong(var1.getTag(""transmission.latency"")), (long)1);             MetricsStreamProcessor.getInstance().in(var2);         }     } ```","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2021-10-11T15:47:45Z","2021-10-12T06:33:27Z"

I am so sorry @LIU-WEI-git @jixuan1989 I have to initialize this **revert** due to our recent performance testing result.  Here are the graphs of SkyWalking OAP server so11y(self-obsevability) result. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/143798527-5e0f38a7-379b-4d03-8f38-38b901ad57d2.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/143798529-6eb48e02-38f8-481e-a148-59c77eec26a6.png)  Before 9:45, the OAP includes the pull request of IoTDB storage implementation, you can see that, it provides much lower performance than it should be(after 9:45). The analysis capability drops from `30+k/s` to `< 10k/s`, which is hard to believe.  Both of these testing are running in new deployed environment, most importantly, IoTDB storage option is even **NEVER ACTIVATED**, which could only provide one possibility, the packages(jars) we introduced have clear conflicts and performance impact to SkyWalking server.  This is the first time I see this happened, which surprised me too. But tests verified this repeatedly. So I am submitting this pull request, and will ask @mrproliu to verify again according this branch.","closed","high priority,","wu-sheng","2021-11-29T02:21:32Z","2021-11-29T09:18:49Z"

Refactor span analysis code structures.  ___  In our showcase and Java agent scenarios, there are several cross-thread tracing cases, we were not generating endpoint dependency if ref exists in local and exit span. In this PR, I am adding this missing part back. Also, in case the downstream endpoint of the dependency is another local/exit span's operation name, which was not generating endpoint traffic before, I add traffic generation of both sides' endpoints of dependency. Another important point that drives me to fix this is, in the new Booster UI, metrics of endpoint dependency are shown in a separate dashboard, which requires the endpoints of both sides existing in meta data, otherwise, nothing shows up.  For e2e, I updated the Java agent to the latest.  @kezhenxu94 @wankai123  Please verify this would enhance the endpoint dependency on the showcase.","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2022-03-25T13:41:17Z","2022-03-26T12:00:28Z"

I did some research about my last change, and found out this bug only could occur when traffic is low. I was using `channels.getChannelSize() * channels.size()`, and I thought it is the size, and actually `channels.size()` is the size already. So with this wrong usage, the priority is always very low, and hard(maybe never?) to reach over 50. Then the queue is full with a very low priority, not consuming anymore.  The fix is easy, make the priority back to expected value.","closed","high priority,","wu-sheng","2022-04-21T12:44:59Z","2022-04-21T15:31:25Z"

Writing the benchmark itself is not hard, but getting it right is. Thankfully, the JMH suite provides helpful annotations and features to mitigate most of them. To get started, you need to make your benchmark extend the AbstractMicrobenchmark, which makes sure the test gets run through JUnit and configures some defaults: ``` @BenchmarkMode({Mode.Throughput}) public class LinkedArrayBenchmark extends AbstractMicrobenchmark { } ```  For most benchmark tests, you can write it as a normal JUnit. You can also choose Customizing Runtime Conditions.  At present, you can run all JMH Tests by running the jar directly after packaging. But running all JMH directly through mvn and showing that the overall report still has some problems, you can first see if it is reasonable.","closed","test,","CalvinKirs","2021-10-21T16:36:33Z","2022-05-11T09:27:26Z"

I just found out that the recent docs (including OAP > 8.7.0-8.9.1 & Python agent entirely etc.) were not picked up by the Algolia search engine at all.  Now searching for keywords within those docs either returns nothing or results from other repos, which is quite confusing.  The config file was hosted in the Algolia [repo](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/skywalking.json), which happened to be deprecated and now requires configuration through a [web interface](https://crawler.algolia.com/) that I don't have access to.    FYI @Jtrust, as you added the previous configs through GitHub.  ### What you expected to happen  Versioned doc pages should yield corresponding search results when using the top right search box.   ### How to reproduce  1. Search within [Java agent: v8.9.0](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/skywalking-java/v8.9.0/readme/) returns nothing. 2. Search within [Python agent: latest](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/skywalking-python/latest/readme/) only returns results from OAP docs, while v0.7.0 gives nothing  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","website,","Superskyyy","2022-03-20T05:40:22Z","2022-04-09T14:34:47Z"

I have try solution in https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5263 and https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6324 , but not work for me.  When I use uwsgi in **master workers mode** and **threads mode**, the skywalking python sdk does not report the metrics while the program is running, it reports metrics only after I close uwsgi...

The topology is strange.     There are two kafka nodes in the topology.  but the two nodes should be the same in fact.  I have debugged the `oap` codes. I found when `oap` analysised `service relation` from segment, the source layer type of the service `agent_test_3` was set `LAYER.VIRTUAL_MQ`, however, the target layer type of the service `agent_test_2` was set `LAYER.MQ`.  it result in the same kafka service id of the two spans are  different, then, it causes the topology is strange.  ### What you expected to happen  There should be one kafka node in the topology.  ### How to reproduce  one service pushes messages to kafka, another service consumes from the kafka.  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","backend,","Cool-Coding","2022-05-17T10:24:40Z","2022-05-17T12:42:52Z"

In the `agent.config`, file I mentioned the backend service address to `127.0.0.1:11800` for both the services and OAP running at 12800, both were spring boot applications one pointed at 8080 and the other at 8082 while the skywalking server was pointed at 8081.  Logs showed up that: ``` Caused by: org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AnnotatedConnectException: Connection refused: /127.0.0.1:11800 Caused by: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused 	at sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.checkConnect(Native Method) 	at sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.finishConnect(SocketChannelImpl.java:716) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannel.doFinishConnect(NioSocketChannel.java:330) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.nio.AbstractNioChannel$AbstractNioUnsafe.finishConnect(AbstractNioChannel.java:334) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.processSelectedKey(NioEventLoop.java:702) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.processSelectedKeysOptimized(NioEventLoop.java:650) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.processSelectedKeys(NioEventLoop.java:576) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.run(NioEventLoop.java:493) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$4.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:989) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74) 	at org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.netty.util.concurrent.FastThreadLocalRunnable.run(FastThreadLocalRunnable.java:30) 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748) ```  How should I configure it for both the services to show up on the same UI?  ### What you expected to happen  Both the services are trying to send the metrics at the same gRPC port so maybe this is the reason.  ### How to reproduce  Trying to configure multiple services using this documentation: https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/v8.4.0/en/setup/service-agent/java-agent/readme/  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","bug,","MenusGarg5981","2021-11-02T18:59:14Z","2021-11-03T00:53:27Z"

The CounterWindow class is a Singleton class.  it uses Map to store the window data. the Map key is combined by name and labels of a metric. but both of  first and second aggregation have the same metric name and labels. the metric name is ""metrics_aggregation"" and the labels are ""service"" and ""instance"".  this will result in that they will use the same window.  the increase method is as below  ``` java   public Tuple2 increase(String name, ImmutableMap labels, Double value, long windowSize, long now) {         ID id = new ID(name, labels);         Queue> window = windows.computeIfAbsent(id, unused -> new PriorityQueue<>());         window.offer(Tuple.of(now, value));         long waterLevel = now - windowSize;         Tuple2 peek = window.peek();         if (peek._1 > waterLevel) {             return peek;         }          Tuple2 result = peek;         while (peek._1 < waterLevel) {             result = window.poll();             peek = window.element();         }          // Choose the closed slot to the expected timestamp         if (waterLevel - result._1 <= peek._1 - waterLevel) {             return result;         }          return peek;     } ```  The right configurations i think and have proved are as below.  - self.yaml in fetcher-prom-rules  > I delete the first and second aggregation and create a new metric named ""instance_metrics_aggregation"".   ```  - name: instance_metrics_aggregation     exp: metrics_aggregation.tagEqual('dimensionality', 'minute').sum(['service', 'instance', 'level']).increase('PT5M').tag({tags -> if (tags['level'] == '1') {tags.level = 'first aggregation'} }).tag({tags -> if (tags['level'] == '2') {tags.level = 'second aggregation'} })  ```  - self-observability in ui-initialized-templates  ```       {         ""width"": ""3"",         ""title"": ""Aggregation"",         ""height"": ""200"",         ""entityType"": ""ServiceInstance"",         ""independentSelector"": false,         ""metricType"": ""LABELED_VALUE"",         ""metricName"": ""meter_oap_instance_metrics_aggregation"",         ""queryMetricType"": ""readLabeledMetricsValues"",         ""chartType"": ""ChartBar"",         ""unit"": ""Per 5 Minute""       } ```  ### How to reproduce  I have debuged in the increase method and watch the metric value in the ui page.  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","backend,","Cool-Coding","2022-03-18T13:14:55Z","2022-03-21T11:03:40Z"

When satellite wants to forward fetched prometheus metrics to meter system, there is no way to set up `-Inf` as the first bucket.  ```proto // The histogram element definition. It includes the bucket lower boundary and the count in the bucket. message MeterBucketValue {     // The value represents the min value of the bucket,     // the  upper boundary is determined by next MeterBucketValue$bucket,     // if it doesn't exist, the upper boundary is positive infinity.     // Also, could use Int32.MIN_VALUE to represent negative infinity.     double bucket = 1;     int64 count = 2; } ```  >     // Also, could use Int32.MIN_VALUE to represent negative infinity.  First of all, this is never implemented. Then this is not a good practice.  ### What you expected to happen  ```proto // The histogram element definition.

But in the process, it doesn't declare entity ID, so when it is forwarded into alarm kernel, this `Can't split service ID into 2 parts` raises up. Meanwhile, I am not sure why the timebucket could not be downsampling in OAL-generated metrics. The only thing I could guess is, somehow, it could be not-set.  The `Can't split service ID into 2 parts` is easy to fix. `@ScopeDefaultColumn.VirtualColumnDefinition(fieldName = ""entityId"", columnName = ""entity_id"", isID = true, type = String.class)` should be added into event.  @kezhenxu94 Also, we should consider seriously, whether this is a good practice to use one object being both source and manual metrics.

Error log: ``` ERROR 2022-06-21 18:05:45.958 pool-9-thread-2 InstMethodsInter : class[class org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient] before method[get] intercept failure  java.lang.NullPointerException         at org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.elasticsearch.v6.interceptor.RestHighLevelClientGetMethodsInterceptor.beforeMethod(RestHighLevelClientGetMethodsInterceptor.java:44)         at org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.interceptor.enhance.InstMethodsInter.intercept(InstMethodsInter.java:76)         at org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient.get(RestHighLevelClient.java) ``` Supported-list.md shows that the elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client only supports 6.7.1-6.8.4, while the current version is 6.3.0, but it should not have been enhanced. We found that there is a problem selecting withess classes in `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.elasticsearch.v6.define.RestHighLevelClientInstrumentation` in elasticsearch-6.x-plugin.The current selected withess class is `org.elasticsearch.transport.TaskTransportChannel`, and `org.elasticsearch.transport.TaskTransportChannel` also exists in elasticsearch:6.3.0, so it has been incorrectly enhanced. In the interceptor for `org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient` constructor, `getNodes()` will be called: ``` List nodeList = restClient.getNodes(); ``` Both `org.elasticsearch.client.Node` and `org.elasticsearch.client.RestClient#getNodes()` are introduced in the elasticsearch:6.4.0, this will cause exceptions, as a result, subsequent `objInst.setSkyWalkingDynamicField(restClientEnhanceInfo)`  is not called successfully, when other methods of `org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient` are called later, `objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField()` returns null and then causes NPE.  ### What you expected to happen  When using org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client:6.3.0, `org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient` should not be enhanced, avoid throw NPE. We may use `org.elasticsearch.client.indices.CreateIndexResponse` as the witness class. This class was introduced in elasticsearch:6.7.0, also can change the supported version to 6.7.0-6.8.4.  ### How to reproduce  Use org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client:6.3.x and mount skywalking-agent. Create an object of `org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient` and call its `get` method.  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","java,","xzyJavaX","2022-06-22T05:22:09Z","2022-06-24T01:18:03Z"

When I call the third-party service with resttemplate after I mount the Javaagent,  it returns HTTP 400. It is normal for me to use postman to call this interface. After I debugged the code, I found that there were more headers on the Request after skywalking was mounted，such as ""sw8""、""sw8-correlation""、""sw8-x"". The problem is that the header of ""sw8-correlation"" is an empty string.  Some versions of springboot applications will return bad request.  I tried to add content to ""sw8-correlation"", but failed.

This implementation actually will create a [`redis.clients.jedis.Transaction`](https://github.com/redis/jedis/blob/master/src/main/java/redis/clients/jedis/Transaction.java) object with `BinaryJedis.multi()` which returns a new `Transaction` with a low-level `redis.clients.jedis.Client`.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2568208/139041799-990ae421-8306-4405-b8d2-778cc820ebde.png)  and   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2568208/139042189-6283efdf-26c4-4b27-aa50-6316fdcf50e1.png)  This client is not enhanced by our `jedis-2.x` plugin while we've already have `PipelineSetClientMethodInterceptor` for `Pipeline` class. We still need support for `Transaction` case.  This will cause empty peer service (e.g. ""null"") in `JedisMethodInterceptor` when we are going to create an ExitSpan.  Another issue we are facing is both `MultiKeyPipelineBaseInstrumentation` and `PipelineBaseInstrumentation` will enhance the `Pipeline` and `Transaction` twice for such methods existing in the base class like `set` and `exist`. This issue is easy to be fixed by using `DeclaredInstanceMethodsInterceptPoint` instead of `InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint`.   ### What you expected to happen  We expect correct peer service and single enhancement for jedis.  ### How to reproduce  I may create an E2E test case to reproduce this issue.  ### Anything else  Not sure this bugfix should be included in the upcoming `8.8.0` since the release window will be closed soon.  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","java,","lujiajing1126","2021-10-27T10:15:08Z","2021-10-28T01:33:42Z"

I have checked the [No default constructor found. #622](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/622) .There is still a bug here, Spring supports private constructors by default, but when I use agent get a No default constructor found Exception.  The following is an analysis of the cause of the problem: `org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor#determineCandidateConstructors` use `java.lang.Class#getDeclaredConstructors` to get declared constructors(These are public, protected, default (package) access, and private constructors) . But, `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.patch.AutowiredAnnotationProcessorInterceptor` ignored the private constructors.  ### What you expected to happen  Spring supports private constructors by default, I think  skywalking agent should support this too.  ### How to reproduce  The example code is as follows:   ```java @RestController public class TestNoConstructor {      private final TestService testService;     // use private constructor with one parameter     private TestNoConstructor(TestService testService) {         this.testService = testService;     } } ```  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [x] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","java,","adaivskenan","2022-02-10T06:37:00Z","2022-02-16T10:09:20Z"

I'm expecting a fix to a newer version  ### How to reproduce  Using `log4j 2.15.0`, `apm-tookit-log4j-2.x` set log4j2 pattern layout with `%traceId` print a log  ### Anything else  Every line of log is printed as this wrong format  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","java,","lixplor","2021-12-17T07:43:25Z","2021-12-20T08:59:38Z"

"","8525","[Bug] Incorrect trace from dubbo 3.x plugin in more complex scenario due to the incorrect Side judgement(consumer or provider)","### Search before asking  - [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.   ### Apache SkyWalking Component  Java Agent (apache/skywalking-java)  ### What happened  I think I have found a bug of the dubbo 3.x plugin due to incorrect using of `RpcContext`, and the test scenario we have now is too simple to find it:  If there is an invoking chain which is A -> B -> C,  B is a Dubbo provider and also a consumer to C. Obviously B should report 2 span (a `Entry Span` from A and a `Exit Span` to C). But in fact it only reports one Span in the Segment, and it's content is chaotic.  As it used the `RpcServiceContext` to judge if now is in the consumer or provider side, if the above B service is both  a provider and consumer, the `RpcServiceContext` is not changed when it calls C. Combined with Skywalking's `createSpan` logic, the result becomes puzzling.  After replaced to my new written judge method, the problem resolved.  ### What you expected to happen  Service B should report a segment contains an `EntrySpan` and an `ExitSpan`.  ### How to reproduce  Modify the test scenario to add one more invocation from `GreetService`, here paste my test scenario key code: GreetServiceImpl.java ```java /*  * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more  * contributor license agreements.

Since the `ScheduledNodeSampler` runs on a separate thread, active span may not exist.

Since I use the `apm-trace-ignore-plugin-8.10.0.jar` plugin, the `ContextManager` will create an `IgnoredTracerContext` if the reported path matches the filter criteria. This causes the `apm-shenyu-2.4.x-plugin-8.10.0.jar` plugin to throw a null pointer exception.  ``` #org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.shenyu.v24x.GlobalPluginExecuteMethodInterceptor.java , line 77 exchange.getAttributes().put(SHENYU_AGENT_TRACE_ID, snapshot.getTraceId().getId()); ```  `snapshot.getTraceId()` is `NULL`, and `ContextManager` cannot execute the 'stopSpan' method.  ### How to reproduce  Enable both the `apm-shenyu-2.4.x-plugin-8.10.0.jar` and `apm-trace-ignore-plugin-8.10.0.jar` plugins, and set the `\` path to ignore reporting  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [ ] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","java,","always-web","2022-06-20T04:15:21Z","2022-06-20T14:02:03Z"

In fact, there is not 300 span in the segment.    ### What you expected to happen  `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.grpc.v1.server.TracingServerCallListener` ```     public void onCancel() {         final AbstractSpan span = ContextManager.createLocalSpan(operationPrefix + REQUEST_ON_CANCEL_OPERATION_NAME);         span.setComponent(ComponentsDefine.GRPC);         span.setLayer(SpanLayer.RPC_FRAMEWORK);         ContextManager.continued(contextSnapshot);         try {             super.onCancel();         } catch (Throwable t) {             ContextManager.activeSpan().log(t);             throw t;         } finally {             ContextManager.stopSpan();             asyncSpan.asyncFinish();         }     } ```  The  `contextSnapshot` and `asyncSpan` are all null at some situation. This result in the cancal span is not stoped. when skywalking calls the `getOrCreate` method to create `TracingContext`, it will use the cancel tracingContext. Because the value of  `CONTEX.get` is not null.  Further more, This caused an error that exceeded the span quantity threshold.  `org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.context.ContextManager` ```     private static AbstractTracerContext getOrCreate(String operationName, boolean forceSampling) {         AbstractTracerContext context = CONTEXT.get();         if (context == null) {             if (StringUtil.isEmpty(operationName)) {                 if (LOGGER.isDebugEnable()) {                     LOGGER.debug(""No operation name, ignore this trace."");                 }                 context = new IgnoredTracerContext();             } else {                 if (EXTEND_SERVICE == null) {                     EXTEND_SERVICE = ServiceManager.INSTANCE.findService(ContextManagerExtendService.class);                 }                 context = EXTEND_SERVICE.createTraceContext(operationName, forceSampling);              }             CONTEXT.set(context);         }         return context;     } ```   **Why the value of contextSnapshot and asyncSpan are null?**  The value of `contextSnapshot` and `asyncSpan` is set in onReady method.  `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.grpc.v1.server.TracingServerCallListener` ```     @Override     public void onReady() {         final AbstractSpan span = ContextManager.createEntrySpan(operation, contextCarrier);         span.setComponent(ComponentsDefine.GRPC);         span.setLayer(SpanLayer.RPC_FRAMEWORK);         contextSnapshot = ContextManager.capture();         asyncSpan = span.prepareForAsync();         ContextManager.stopSpan(asyncSpan);          super.onReady();     } ```  this `TracingServerCallListener.onReady` method is called by the `io.grpc.internal.ServerCallImpl.onReady` method ```     @Override     public void onReady() {       if (call.cancelled) {         return;       }       listener.onReady();     }      public void closed(Status status) {       try {         if (status.isOk()) {           listener.onComplete();         } else {           call.cancelled = true;           listener.onCancel();         }       } finally {         // Cancel context after delivering RPC closure notification to allow the application to         // clean up and update any state based on whether onComplete or onCancel was called.         context.cancel(null);       }     } ```  In debug mode, I found the value of `call.cancelled` variable was true. so the onReady was directly returned. the execution of `OnReady` and `onCancel` were asynchronized. when the close method was called, Both of the value of `contextSnapshot` and `asyncSpan` were null.   ### How to reproduce    I will explain it with a demo. Suppose there are two applications named agent_test_2 and agent_test_3.  Agent_test_2 calls a grpc method named `sayHello` of Agent_test_3. There are many grpc calls at the same time. Some calls time out.  In this case, the trace is wrong.  ## Let's see the right traces.  ### A completed trace without error ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29882506/161904888-cf70dab4-230e-4d6d-ad44-57a83b47a742.png)  ### A completed trace with timeout error ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29882506/161905476-a37f354f-f204-4682-bf86-ca4d07c64a50.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29882506/161905347-f73e3a63-e8c4-4f8a-bd60-4ee76270b4d4.png)  ## Let's see the wrong traces.  ### this trace is not completed   ### this trace is disordered   I have changed the code in my local computer and verify it.

"","8249","[Bug] Earlier versions of netty-codec or other jar packages have security breach in agent 8.8.0","### Search before asking  - [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.   ### Apache SkyWalking Component  Java Agent (apache/skywalking-java)  ### What happened    In skywalking agent 8.8.0, netty and netty-codec versions are 4.1.63.Final, and guava versions are 20.0, which are found to have security breach. The netty version should be upgraded to version 4.1.68.Final or above, while the guava version should be upgraded after 30.0.   At the same time, I found that the version of oap 8.8.0 is different, netty-codec's version is 4.1.68.Final and guava's version is 28.1-jre. Whether the version of the agent can be modified is consistent on both sides?   ### What you expected to happen  Maintain a consistent version and no security breach in the final version  ### How to reproduce  The netty version should be upgraded to version 4.1.68.Final or above, while the guava version should be upgraded after 30.0.  ### Anything else  **Some of the descriptions of security breach are listed below.** **netty-codec-http** **Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method ""File.createTempFile"" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions ""-rw-r--r--"". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's ""AbstractDiskHttpData"" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own ""java.io.tmpdir"" when you start the JVM or use ""DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)"" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.** **netty-codec** **The Bzip2 decompression decoder function doesn't allow setting size restrictions on the decompressed output data (which affects the allocation size used during decompression). All users of Bzip2Decoder are affected. The malicious input can trigger an OOME and so a DoS attack** **guava** **A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.**","closed","agent,","Linda-pan","2021-12-06T07:54:10Z","2022-01-28T07:40:24Z"

For example, the `disabled` field in the `ui_template`,  ```json {   ""metadata"": {     ""name"": ""ui_template"",     ""group"": ""default""   },   ""tag_families"": [     {       ""name"": ""data"",       ""tags"": [...]      },     {       ""name"": ""searchable"",       ""tags"": [         {           ""name"": ""name"",           ""type"": ""TAG_TYPE_STRING""         },         {           ""name"": ""disabled"",           ""type"": ""TAG_TYPE_INT"" // we have to filter with `disabled`         }       ]     }   ],   ""entity"": {     ""tag_names"": [       ""name""     ]   },   ""opts"": {     ...   },   ""updated_at_nanoseconds"": ""2021-04-15T01:30:15.01Z"" } ```  The inverted index is suitable for this case, since we only need to search with a precise status. But this does not work as expected.   Temporary, I have to switch to the tree index to make this work.  ### What you expected to happen  In this case, we need to verify the support for inverted index on the numeric types.  ### How to reproduce  Declare an inverted index for int type and query.  ### Anything else  Besides, I would like to propose `bool` type support for our BanyanDB. This would be space-efficient compared to the current compromise.  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","database,","lujiajing1126","2022-02-09T03:37:48Z","2022-04-14T13:34:18Z"

Remove https://github.com/apache/skywalking-banyandb-java-client/blob/main/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/banyandb/v1/client/metadata/Duration.java#L33-L34   2. Add Day duration support to the server-side and update API comments accordingly.  ### What you expected to happen  None  ### How to reproduce  None  ### Anything else  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","database,","hanahmily","2022-04-26T02:45:18Z","2022-04-28T00:16:58Z"

By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings. See https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt.  However, in the implementation of BanyanDB, the bound of time (epoch nanoseconds) is represented by the type of `int64`, thus the time range should adhere to this limitation.  https://github.com/apache/skywalking-banyandb/blob/b61ab295c38c672ca7aa60e308d0d64037272766/banyand/tsdb/series_seek_sort.go#L113-L116  ### What you expected to happen  The time range should be limited by the bound from `1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` to `2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775806Z`. This is also the default value in [`influxdb`](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/tldr-influxdb-tech-tips-november-10-2016/).  1. The `sw-banyandb-java-client` should impose this range check. 2. The liaison module or the query parser should validate this boundary. 3. OAP storage module should be careful with this.  ### How to reproduce  For example, use `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z` as the upper bound of the time range, we would get nothing from the database which is not expected.  ### Anything else  > Q: What’s the maximum timestamp that InfluxDB can handle? > A: The maximum timestamp is 9223372036854775806 or 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775806Z. The minimum timestamp is -9223372036854775806 or 1677-09-21T00:12:43.145224194Z. > InfluxDB returns a [parsing error](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/errors/#unable-to-parse-time-outside-range) if your point has a timestamp outside that time range.  ### Are you willing to submit PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","database,","lujiajing1126","2022-02-09T02:44:26Z","2022-04-20T08:25:26Z"

Does skywalking's javaAgent consider extracting a javaSDK for tracking like opentelemetry-SdK, allowing users to choose between javaAgent or javaSDK tracking in the same process or between different processes?  ### Use case  When we promote tracing in a distributed system, we found that some java system users are willing to accept the javaAgent mode, and some java system users are more willing to accept the javaSDK embedding mode based on risk or security considerations.  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","feature,","chenyi19851209","2021-12-08T06:34:35Z","2021-12-08T06:36:24Z"

There are 2 kinds of `License and Notice` files. ## Source codes license and notice.  These two files declare the IP and owner relative things.  - Main repo's License, https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/LICENSE - Main repo's Notice, https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/NOTICE  Source codes are allowed to be copied from 3rd party projects, only if they are licensed in ASF's catalog A list, https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a  Everything copied should be listed in the License with owners, repository, and License type, like this https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/LICENSE#L215.   ## Binary license and notice The binary license and notice are for runtime dependencies. All runtime dependencies, including the hierarchy dependencies,  are all should be listed in the License file. Such as the main repo's License, https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/dist-material/release-docs/LICENSE#L204  ## How to write License and Notice - If it is not licensed by APLv2 standard version, we should copy the license files, and host them in the `licenses` folder. Like [this license](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-nginx-lua/blob/e831a9d3147518775cac92f508e0af756a5fab37/LICENSE#L211-L219) and [this folder](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-nginx-lua/tree/master/licenses) - If it is licensed by APLv2, and the Notice file includes more information, we should copy the contents of their NOTICE file into our NOTICE file.   @Shikugawa One more question, do we only recommend users to use the library through cargo?  ASF only requires source codes(for every release) should be hosted on svn, https://downloads.apache.org/skywalking/. Some projects like the main repo host the binary as it could run directly.

Not every user is aware of this, which generally causes confusion. Fortunately, this can be automatically done starting Python 3.7 thanks to [this functionality](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.register_at_fork).   For newcomers, this is a good first issue to start with. This is a simple yet very critical user experience enhancement feature.  ### Use case  Python agent should startup normally and automatically under prefork servers.   ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","open","python,","Superskyyy","2022-05-17T02:59:02Z","2022-07-06T07:27:21Z"

These settings can be customized through system properties at runtime.  Its name may be like this: AbstractMicrobenchmark, the developer is writing JMH TEST needs to make his JMH Test extend the AbstractMicrobenchmark, which makes sure the test gets run through JUnit and configures some defaults:  another advantage is that in terms of code structure, all JMH Tests are separated from ordinary Tests.  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","test,","CalvinKirs","2021-10-12T03:52:38Z","2021-11-11T04:01:40Z"

Support load docker images to the `KinD` environment, reference to: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/private-registries/ . 	here is an example, when we detect `kind-import-images`, then we could using `kind load docker-image` to load them. 	```yaml 	setup: 	  env: kind 	  file: kind.yaml 	  kind-import-images: 	    - skywalking/ui:latest 	    - skywalking/oap:latest 	``` 3. Support exposes `service/pod` ports for host access. I found two plan to do this. 	1. Using Kubernetes port-forward to do, but we need to keep the process running when just running the `setup` stage. 	2. Using `Ingress` to access the service, but it only supports the `HTTP` protocol, also we need to self-generate the random port for user access.    I prefer using the first plan, it's easier to use, understand, and has no conflict. We could declare the exposed port and expose the random port to the environment:     ```yaml 	setup:   	  env: kind   	  file: kind.yaml   	  kind-expose-ports:         - namespace: default           resource: pod/foo           port: 8080,9090    ```  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","infra-e2e,","mrproliu","2021-10-15T07:45:45Z","2021-10-24T14:14:04Z"

"","9185","[Feature] TopN Aggregation","### Search before asking  - [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.   ### Description  This task is a follow-up task to implement the API introduced by https://github.com/apache/skywalking-banyandb/pull/57. This whole process should be based on a streaming calculation model:  * A `publisher` to provide a sequence of data points from a `source_measure ` defined by `TopNAggregation` * A`subscriber` subscribes to the sequence from the `publisher`, aggregating data points on demand.  There are some implementation details:  ## Where does the publisher get data points?  The publisher keeps scanning the `source_measure` and recording the latest timestamp to help it recover from a crash or stop.  The embed etcd is a good place to store the timestamp. The publisher could set a syncing interval to store the ts in case of giving much pressure to etcd.   ## Where to store the results  subscriber ejects the results into a new group which is designed to store topn aggregated results. This new group is based on tsdb and shares the same physical options with the `source_measure`'s group.  ## How to place results in tsdb  tsdb is key-value storage from the client's perspective. we could place results like  ``` ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │                     │                                             │ │         key         │   value                                     │ ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │                     │                                             │ │    metadata_hash+ts │   entity_name:value, entity_name:value...   │ ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │                     │                                             │ │    ...              │               ...                           │ ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │                     │                                             │ │    ...              │               ...                           │ └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘                 ```  The goal of `topnaggregation` is to support sorting massive entities, for example, sw's endpoints. That's the reason we store entity_name instead of entity_id. And we have a plan to remove the metadata storage which contains mapping between them.    ### Use case  _No response_  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","open","database,","hanahmily","2022-06-08T03:27:19Z","2022-06-08T03:27:20Z"

In saving traces, tags are indexed as query conditions to make users easier to locate important traces, but meanwhile, the whole trace segment is already stored as binary(base64 encoded) in the no-indexing field. So most indexed tags are actually duplicated from the data table perspective.  I hope we could have a way to define a field/column of a table indexing(by different index types) but also not stored. All fields in this type are not allowed in `projection` clearly because they are stored, OAP could read those values from the binary field directly.  @wankai123 is going to propose this in ElasticSearch storage implementation.  ### Use case  _No response_  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","open","database,","wu-sheng","2022-03-14T10:02:26Z","2022-03-14T10:50:06Z"

This happened before, but I didn't invest why, but I faced this again at https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/8405/commits/5f76ea938a7db9e3af534bb9016c360021c5e126.   J2EE was renamed to Jakarta EE before the JDK11, so, gRPC(maybe other projects too) has a JVM-sensitive dependency mechanism to adopt it. So, when the developer packages the project in JDK11+, some more libs are included in `oap-libs`.  I also checked `8.9.1` image in JDK11, and verified we don't need this even in the runtime. So, generally, we don't need to add these into the license file.  @kezhenxu94 Just a suggestion, do you think we should consider excluding it from gRPC explicitly? Or is this possible? I think if we could, it is better we do this.  ### Use case  _No response_  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","chore,","wu-sheng","2022-01-12T07:38:16Z","2022-01-18T06:46:26Z"

For example, the `auth`, `jdk`, `mtls` and `ssl` in main repo share the same verification cases but we need to duplicate the codes. https://github.com/apache/skywalking-java/pull/42#issuecomment-932974220 is a similar feature request to share the code snippets, I think if we share the `verify.cases`, others like `setup`, `trigger` can be tolerable because they are short enough.   ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","infra-e2e,","kezhenxu94","2021-10-11T03:07:14Z","2021-10-12T06:31:38Z"

While there is no way for Jedis and Redission plugins to do the similar configuration.  ### Use case  I think it will be good that all the three Redis plugins act in the same way. Because users are not very concerned about which client they are using, they just want to collect redis parameters for more details or discard redis parameters for better performance.  So a general configuration for all redis plugins or two more separated configurations for each redis plugin are needed, to define whether to trace redis parameters.  ### Related issues  https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6613  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","java,","ArjenDavid-sjtu","2022-01-12T09:02:55Z","2022-01-17T10:12:18Z"

Please use [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), which provides [backwards compatibility](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/compatibility/opentracing.md) with OpenTracing.  The above statement is from the official channel, https://opentracing.io/  ### Use case  OpenTracing bridge existed for years, but we don't have very positive user feedback. Most are using agent + our native SDK(APIs and annotations).  We should consider removing the OpenTracing bridge, evaluating the OpenTelemetry APIs, to see whether it is necessary to adopt them.  Eventually,  we need to remove the OpenTracing bridge as we never upgraded to the latest release due to not suitable anymore.  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","open","java,","wu-sheng","2022-02-07T06:49:34Z","2022-08-02T17:32:20Z"

So, in https://github.com/apache/skywalking-java/pull/123, I am removing this feature and making namespace like today's general concept, the namespace of Kubernetes.   Since Java agent 8.10.0 **${service name} = [${group name}::]${logic name}|${NAMESPACE}|${CLUSTER}**  It is better Python agent could follow the same path.

This issue is used to improve this part of the function. Mainly divided into two parts: 1. The agent transmits the Tracing Context to the database: puts comment into sql prefix. Multiple tracing context item are created as one comment, use "","" to separate each item, and the key value in each item is separated by ""."". The format is as follows: `/* sw8_context:base64_encode(item1_key).base64_encode(item1_value),base64_encode(item2_key).base64_encode(item2_value) */`. 2.

While using with `docker-compose` v2, it is incompatible,    https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/5becea4ca9f68875334c92f191a13482bcd6e5cf/compose/service.py#L1492-L1498  In the latest version (written in `go`), [`-` is used](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/981aea674d052ee1ab252f71c3ca1f9f8a7e32de/pkg/compose/convergence.go#L252-L257). So the container created cannot be found, and thus the program exits unexpectedly.    A possible approach to solve this is to check `docker-compose` version in the `infra-e2e` and use different strategies for v1 and v2.  Another possible solution is to compare the container name by ignoring the difference between `_` and `-` .   ### Use case  Currently, docker-compose v1 is not under active maintenance.  We may support v2.  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","infra-e2e,","lujiajing1126","2022-02-22T02:10:57Z","2022-02-22T09:05:35Z"

Meanwhile, client-side sharding is not hard with the experience of building Apache ShardingSphere for years, and we have our native protocol and OAP all in control.  We should support static configuration-based sharding to work with multiple BanyanDB servers with each one of them having native replication.

"","8511","[python] [Feature] Add flexibility to 'peer' and 'op' label when using sw_rabbitmq and sw_requests","### Search before asking  - [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.   ### Description  I would like to add options on how to name 'op' and 'peer' when using some of the plugins.  I have already written some code to address this feature and would like to make them part of the product for anyone to use.  Default would still be exactly the same as it is right now, but it would be possible to change the reporting behavior of the plugins for specific needs/services.  Right now, sw_rabbitmq uses: - peer => host:port - op => RabbitMQ/Topic/' + exchange + '/Queue/' + routing_key  I would like to add 2 env. variables to enable this change ( 1 bool + 1 label (Default RabbitMQ)): - peer => {env.var.label}: {exchange}: {routing_key}   Same goes for sw_requests: - peer => netloc - op => path or ""/""  With 3 env. var (1 peer bool, 1 peer label (Default Web Request), 1 op bool): - peer => {label} - op => netloc  ### Use case  RabbitMQ: container 1 -> queue 1 -> container 2 -> queue 2 -> container 3  instead of: service 1 <-> RabbitMQ service 2 <-> RabbitMQ service  3 <- RabbitMQ   Requests: One of our containers calls different urls on the web to get additional information on the data being processed. This creates a crazy topology pointing to each and every webpage being read (tons of them)  We'd rather see: - service 1 -> Web Request  Instead of a storm like this: - service 1 -> url1, url2, url3, url4, url5..., url1000  Plus, in traces, we prefer seeing which websites are slow (netloc) than their precise path.  ### Related issues  There could be more of this coming in later as we start using Skywalking for all our services.   Just a question, I know this could be a big endeavor / change: - Did you plan on having some control over this type of labeling problem from the OAP Server instead of changing every plugin 1 by 1? - I've used AppDynamics and Dynatrace in the past and I really appreciated the possibility to change labels even after the applications went up. it gave APM people much faster results when they didn't have access to the service's configurations or restarts had to be approved.  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","feature,","dcryans","2022-02-08T15:44:29Z","2022-02-08T15:52:45Z"

I finally got a chance to confirm with @kezhenxu94 why. It turns out `oap`'s self-observability and `vm`'s monitoring have the same metric name.  We need a mechanism to identify the source of a SampleFamily to avoid this case. I would like to propose these kind of mechanism.  We add a field precondition field into all MAL related configuration files, including `oc-receiver`, `envoy-metrics-receiver`, `meter-receiver` etc. This field should be a closure returning true/false. When `false` is returned, this SampleFamily set isn't pushed into rules of all including expressions, but simply skip.  @hanahmily Could you confirm this mechanism makes sense?  ### Use case  This feature could avoid empty service issue, and generally it increase the performance of MAL engine, because less calculation are applied by the input metrics set.  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","closed","feature,","wu-sheng","2021-11-18T12:43:38Z","2021-11-19T16:43:41Z"

"","9376","[Feature] Monitoring MySQL Server","### Search before asking  - [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.   ### Description  @yswdqz finished his first contribution in https://github.com/apache/skywalking-java/pull/286. This is a huge step for a new contributor. After this, he DM me asking for a new place to continue his contributions to the SkyWalking community.  So, I want to begin a new extension for SkyWalking's monitoring target - **Database server**.  Right now, we have a **Virtual Database** layer to monitor database performance from a tracing perspective(analyzing metrics from database access spans). But Database Server in the topology is not observed directly.  In this new issue, I want to work with @yswdqz and assist him to help on adding MySQL server monitoring in the SkyWalking 9.2 or 9.3 release  ### Use case  There are several steps we could follow to do this research and further work  ## Background  Unlike tracing relative monitoring, SkyWalking could do observability through a pure metrics ecosystem. Such as, we use OpenTelemetry collector + OpenCensus exporter to monitor Linux and K8s. I prefer we continue this tech stack for MySQL server monitoring.  The dataflow would be `MySQL Server` -> `OpenTelemetry Collector` -> `SkyWalking OpenCensus Receiver` -> `MAL engine`  ## Steps 1. Do research about the ways of MySQL server and OpenTelemetry integration. Various blogs such as [this](https://observiq.com/blog/how-to-monitor-mysql-with-opentelemetry/)(just a reference) introduce how this could work. 2. We discuss and pick one possible solution. 3. Learn [MAL](https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/latest/en/concepts-and-designs/mal/) and get ideas about how to use MAL to analyze metrics. Could take a look at K8s and Linux monitoring. 4. Discuss which metrics we should do for the MySQL server. We could involve more people in this part, such as ppl from MySQL or ShardingSphere community. I could help with this. 5. Add `MySQL` layer to OAP, and begin to set up dashboards(can't be a menu for now) 6. When all dashboards are ready, we could ask @Fine0830 to help with moving `virtual database` as a sub-menu of general service(So, general service could have two children, services and virtual database). And change the `virtual database` to `Database`, then add `MySQL` as a sub and a root layer.  ### Related issues  _No response_  ### Are you willing to submit a PR?  - [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!  ### Code of Conduct  - [X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","open","complexity:medium,","wu-sheng","2022-07-23T13:32:21Z","2022-08-03T07:08:12Z"

The RESTful APIs is exploited to:  * Simplify the authentication and authorization process according to HTTP 1.1 * Leverage OpenAPIs to enhance the documents of APIs  [gRPC gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) is the canonical path to implement this feature. It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the [google.api.http](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46) annotations in your service definitions.

We got a few issues to iron out but the overall experience is great.   So much so I cant stop checking the dashboard looking at all the pretty graphs :) However the dashboard ui isn't very mobile friendly (see screenshot) is it in the pipeline to make it nicer for mobile please ;)   ![Image from iOS (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/393693/163282747-90ec2c70-b0c1-4cf7-b88b-8bfb34516833.jpg)","closed","UI,","Fine0830","2022-04-27T06:27:05Z","2022-05-09T06:54:08Z"

However, in the command line of Windows, whether the file is an executable program is determined by whether the file has a specific suffix, such as "".exe"". Thus, commands such as  `bin/darwin/license-eye -c test/testdata/.licenserc_for_test_fix.yaml header check` will not be executed correctly under Windows.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17879307/135402537-93e625f4-d376-4995-b692-344896a18938.png) After renaming the file `skywalking-eyes\bin\windows\license-eye` to `skywalking-eyes\bin\windows\license-eye.exe`, the command is executed. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17879307/135402746-a394f342-8e98-422c-bd38-c822385bfb31.png) The same is true for `skywalking-infra-e2e`.","closed","license eye,","kezhenxu94","2021-09-30T07:04:09Z","2022-04-22T08:56:32Z"

Use the java agent injector to attach the official agent image.  * update the agent's backend address to the `single-node` or `cluster` feature. (Their address is identical. One of them should be deployed with this feature)  @dashanji Do you interest in this?  @wu-sheng @kezhenxu94 any insight about this?","closed","showcase,","hanahmily","2021-11-29T02:57:25Z","2022-01-26T09:21:04Z"
