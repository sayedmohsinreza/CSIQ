But, even we have that, with current Elastic [current move](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/elastic-java-clients-are-no-longer-open-source/6470), the client is not usable for OpenSearch. We(SkyWalking) don't choose side according to ASF vendor neutral guidance, but we have to follow License and laws. So, once SSPL client is there, we can't distribute with it. Here is what I propose 1. We remove the ElasticSearch 6.x HLRC permanently, so, we don't need to release 2 binary distributions anymore. 2. Use HTTP Client(which lib could be determined later) + JSON for ES 6/7/8, which is also should work with OpenSearch.  For this new storage option, we could name it `sw-native-elasticsearch`.","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2021-08-17T15:31:54Z","2021-09-06T07:21:35Z"

"","7113","TomcatInvokeInterceptor doesn't include HTTP method in endpoint name","Why do you submit this issue? - [x] Feature or performance improvement  ___ ### Requirement or improvement  You can use ""Group Parameterized Endpoints"" to collapse endpoint `/users/10` and `/users/100` but it doesn't differentiate between HTTP method types so doing a `{GET}/users/10` looks the same as `{DELETE}/users/10`.  I've created a patch that adds the HTTP method type before the URL but I'm curious if anyone knows whether the dynamic endpoint can also be determined. That's the `/users/{id}` part that's defined in `@RequestMapping`. My guess is you can't since Tomcat sits a layer above SpringMVC. If that's the case, could you update an entry span's operation name? I ask because I would rather auto-detect this information than create the necessary `endpoint-name-grouping.yml` file. I like that that file exists but I think it's best to consider it as a last result. The idea would be to let Tomcat set the operation name and if a better operation name can be determined by SpringMVC, it would override the original operation name.  If neither method works, is there a way to implement something like `USE_QUALIFIED_NAME_AS_ENDPOINT_NAME` like SpringMVC, or is that again an issue because Tomcat sits above SpringMVC?","closed","discussion,","BFergerson","2021-06-12T00:44:49Z","2021-08-04T00:26:58Z"

"","7322","Evaluate `new object` V.S. object pool for metric objects.","The metric objects, such as PercentileMetrics and PercentileFunction are heavy for creating and GC. Because of the DataTable fields, and the number of creations and destruction.  I have seen @kezhenxu94 reported GC cost is high. Notice, this doesn't mean GC stop time is long(the stop time should be less than 1s per minute), but from the profiling results, the GC process costs too much.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/126058487-0d03546a-45f0-4137-a855-5ab1a7ce2a46.png)  **39% of 8U has been detected in GC.**  @kezhenxu94 Let's do another round recheck for the latest codes if this result is consistent.

When chosing elasticsearch as oap-server's storage, DataTTLKeeperTimer executes HistoryDeleteEsDAO#deleteHistory every 5(default) minutes to delete expired timeseries index, this may cause heavy perfomance loss. Thus I try to set enableDataKeeperExecutor=false to disable DataTTLKeeperTimer and set index ttl on es cluster, but new index will not be created. This is because new index is only created in HistoryDeleteEsDAO#deleteHistory and in oap-server bootstrap. I wonder why not seperate deleteHistory and createIndex into two timers, DataTTLKeeperTimer takes responsibility for delete expired index, and a new Timer takes in charge of creating new index in elasticsearch.","closed","question,","system-designer","2021-03-24T10:36:26Z","2021-03-24T12:48:47Z"

When we use shrding-jdbc to process jdbc statements, due to sharding-sphere, the original statement will be parsed and breaks up into several actual statements to execute. As we want to obtain metrics like CPM and latency for each original statement, both of them, however, are inaccurate. That's because all the actual statements with high cardinality derived from sharding operation was taken into account when calculating the CPM & Latency, instead of being attributed to a single original statement that we found meaningful.  In my personal view, I believe that the key problem is that the entire branch of sub-trace ranging from `/ShardingSphere/JDBCRootInvoke/` endpoint to the last `executeQuery` span cannot obtain the original jdbc statement. Therefore, tag `db.statement` enclose the actual statement instead of the original statement, so when aggregating metrics, traffic was dispersed to multiple sharded statements' groups.  To better demonstrate this problem, later I'll upload a small demo of this issue","closed","invalid,","CrocoRyan","2021-06-08T08:14:50Z","2021-06-08T09:59:51Z"

If recognize the regex rule of raw url, we can push regex rule to mesh sidecar filter. Here is a way to recognize maybe the regex rules of raw urls.   For example,  Raw urls in accesslog: /user/1,/user/2,/user/3,/user/4,/index  we can get this: 1. ""/user"" of first position (split by '/') is in 4 url ; 2. ""/1"" of second position is in 1 url ; 3. ""/2"" of second position is in 1 url ; 4. ""/3"" of second position is in 1 url ; 5. ""/4"" of second position is in 1 url ; 6. ""/index"" of first position is in 1 url ;  ""/user"" of first position is in 4 url and more than others,so we think ""/user"" of first position maybe some regex rule immutable part, others are not immutable part.  Next: 1.  /user/1,  /user is immutable part,not change. /1 is not immutable part and use /[^/]+ to replace,so ^/user/[^/]+$ matched num = 1 ; 2. /user/2, ..., so ^/user/[^/]+$ matched num = 2 ; 3. /user/3, ..., so ^/user/[^/]+$ matched num = 3 ; 4. /user/4, ..., so ^/user/[^/]+$ matched num = 4 ; 5. /index , /index is not immutable part,use /[^/]+ to replace, so ^/[^/]+$ num = 1 ;  Finally: we select the top num matched ^/user/[^/]+$ push to mesh sidecar filter;  And repeat above action;  Like mostly learning algorithms,it is not ensure 100% right and need more data to be more right, but in our company product enviroment ,it can cover 95% case ,and 5% case need user manually set and adjust.I don't know if it helps in skywalking mesh url mitrics.","closed","question,","Gallop-stark","2021-04-30T03:06:29Z","2021-05-01T02:12:25Z"

What is the difference between the service's cpm and the service instance's spm? According to my understanding, the service's cpm is the total number of requests received by the service in a unit time, and the service instance's cpm is the total number of requests received by the service node in a unit time. But according to our online statistics, the total number of cpm nodes will be greater than the number of cpm services. I am very confused about this. I read the source code and saw that cpm actually does a sum operation in a unit of time, then the two data should not be so different in theory. ___ ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS, and JRE?  - Which company or project?  - What happened?

I use dynamic configuration(nacos)  to management alarm config, and **not intent** to manage slowDBAccessThreshold. So I do not config the agent-analyzer.default.slowDBAccessThreshold. But it worked weird, the default threshold will be changed to 10000, I read the code and found that if not config slowDBAccessThreshold in nacos, the code will rewrite the default threshold to 10000 because of triggering of DELETE notify. And this will confuse the user, where the 10000 comes from.  ```java DBLatencyThresholdsAndWatcher  private void activeSetting(String config) {         Map newThresholds = new HashMap<>();         String[] settings = config.split("","");         for (String setting : settings) {             String[] typeValue = setting.split("":"");             if (typeValue.length == 2) {                 newThresholds.put(typeValue[0].trim().toLowerCase(), Integer.parseInt(typeValue[1].trim()));             }         }         if (!newThresholds.containsKey(""default"")) {             newThresholds.put(""default"", 10000);         }          thresholds.set(newThresholds);         settingsString.set(config);     }  public void notify(ConfigChangeEvent value) {         if (EventType.DELETE.equals(value.getEventType())) {             activeSetting("""");         } else {             activeSetting(value.getNewValue());         }     } ```  ___ ### Requirement or improvement - Please describe your requirements or improvement suggestions.

I am developing a threading plugin to make it possible to trace cross threads. Other than current trace-cross-thread implementations in SkyWalking, my implementation enhanced ThreadPoolExecutor and ForkJoinTask, like alibaba transmitable-thread-local, and I have encountered a problem.  In my plugin, the ForkJoinTask constructor has been enhanced, I found that SkyWalking create a new constructor with ByteBuddy, and the parameter of this new construtor is a generated class with random names, like this.  ```     public ForkJoinTask() {         this(null);         ForkJoinTaskConstructorInterceptor_internal.intercept(this, (Object[])new Object[0]);     }      private /* synthetic */ ForkJoinTask(auxiliary.MtewiML4 mtewiML4) {      } ```  I realized that the rebase strategy is used in Byte-Buddy in SkyWalking.  When javassist in transmitable-thread-local enhance the ForkJoinTask that has been enhanced by SkyWalking, the class named auxiliary.MtewiML4 could not be found, because it is generated by SkyWalking.  The error log is like this. ``` TtlTransformer: Fail to transform class java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinTask, cause: com.alibaba.ttl.threadpool.agent.internal.javassist.CannotCompileException: cannot find java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask$auxiliary$MtewiML4 com.alibaba.ttl.threadpool.agent.internal.javassist.CannotCompileException: cannot find java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask$auxiliary$MtewiML4 	at com.alibaba.ttl.threadpool.agent.internal.javassist.CtClassType.toBytecode(CtClassType.java:1598) 	at com.alibaba.ttl.threadpool.agent.internal.javassist.CtClass.toBytecode(CtClass.java:1446) 	at com.alibaba.ttl.threadpool.agent.TtlTransformer.transform(TtlTransformer.java:59) 	at sun.instrument.TransformerManager.transform(TransformerManager.java:188) 	at sun.instrument.InstrumentationImpl.transform(InstrumentationImpl.java:428) 	at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredFields0(Native Method) 	at java.lang.Class.privateGetDeclaredFields(Class.java:2583) 	at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredField(Class.java:2068) 	at java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.(ForkJoinPool.java:3370) 	at java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.(CompletableFuture.java:394) 	at org.apache.dubbo.remoting.exchange.support.header.HeaderExchangeHandler.disconnected(HeaderExchangeHandler.java:146) 	at org.apache.dubbo.remoting.transport.AbstractChannelHandlerDelegate.disconnected(AbstractChannelHandlerDelegate.java:48) 	at org.apache.dubbo.remoting.transport.dispatcher.ChannelEventRunnable.run(ChannelEventRunnable.java:73) 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149) 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624) 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748) ```  I want to slove this problem, and I have got three solutions.  1. Use redefine strategy of Byte-Buddy in SkyWalking(I dont know why SkyWalking using rebase strategy, and I am not sure what it really effects when I changed it.) 2. Avoid enhanced private construtors of ForkJoinTask in transmitable-thread-local (This solution makes TTL compatible, but I have to change javassist code) 3. Do not enhance ForkJoinTask, enhance ForkJoinPool or some classes else. (This may solve my problem, but the compatible problem is still unresolved)  What is your opinion? ___ ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS, and JRE? - 8.2.0 OSX java1.8  - Which company or project? - Didi  - What happened?

After `prepareRequests` of a new metrics generated, we don't put this new metrics into `context`. So in the next run of `PersistenceTimer`, when a metrics with same id comes, we have to query db again. Is there some problems cause that we can't put a new metrics object into context?

For simple, I  want collect JSON log with `fluent-bit` and direct push to SkyWalking .

Backendground: My company use prometheus to monitor k8s node and other devices, and use prometheus alertmanager to do alert jobs, so i want to store skywalking metrics data into promethues to keep prometheus alertmanager still working for skywalking metrics.  However, it turns out to be pretty harder than imagination to do this, because skywalking metrics data may change anytime the new trace event come and on the other hand, prometheus does not support update data by timestamp not like elasticsearch or influxdb. it seems to be impossible to implement such a prometheus storage module  it is really appreciated if anyone can provide me with any idea, thx!!!    ___ ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS, and JRE?  - Which company or project?  - What happened?

At present, I found that the writing of service_traffic (ServiceTrafficDispatcher) is only triggered when analyzing the segment reported by the client. However, although some applications do not report segment, the instance information has been reported, such as jvm data. On the oap page, you must first check the service_traffic information before you can check the specific instance information (even if the client has uploaded the instance information, it cannot be queried on the oap page, but it can be obtained in the jvm related table of the ES). Is this reasonable? Would it be better if the writing of service_traffic is triggered in the register of the client?  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15909210/121771482-32104680-cba2-11eb-8909-300bb43a5390.png)","closed","question,","LiWenGu","2021-06-12T09:19:01Z","2021-06-12T12:32:02Z"

The latter issue seems easy to solve as you could simply check the trace stack for `Instrumentation.retransformClasses()` and allow the enhancement to occur again. The former issue seems like it might be a bit harder and I'm curious if anyone has an idea how to solve it. The ways I've been thinking about solving it are either to:  - generate unique but consistent fields names (so each time it comes up with the same field names as before)  - save an additional map to each class which specificies what the existing fields are and reuse the previous names","closed","discussion,","BFergerson","2021-04-07T03:46:32Z","2021-04-07T13:24:40Z"

  because the switch of ""meter"" topic is default disabled. it is configured in application.yml at oap side.  ```yml kafka-fetcher:   selector: ${SW_KAFKA_FETCHER:default}   default:     ......     enableMeterSystem: ${SW_KAFKA_FETCHER_ENABLE_METER_SYSTEM: false}     ..... ```  **Question:**    why does agent only report the ""meter"" topic error, not the two other topics ?   **Answer:**   the kafka report plugin at agent side will send five kind of kafka topics. whereas, oap only create four kind of kafka topics when using kafka namespace.  ![](https://github.com/Cool-Coding/photos/blob/master/skywalking/Snipaste_2021-07-18_21-20-39.png?raw=true)  ___ ### Requirement or improvement   I suggest that we should give default ""true"" value to ""enableMeterSystem"" in order to keep the logic consistency of creating and consuming topic at oap and agent side.","closed","backend,","Cool-Coding","2021-07-18T13:27:23Z","2021-07-19T06:58:24Z"

Hi,  In the skywalking-nginx-lua Doc, skywalking_tracer:finish() function will be called in body_filter_by_lua_block. But in some case, the http request will not execute body_filter_by_lua phase. so this function will not be called.  example:  >     location = xxxxx/xxxxxx { >         rewrite_by_lua_block { >             skywalking_tracer:start(""upstream service"") >         } >  >         proxy_pass http://xxxxxxxxxx; >         proxy_connect_timeout 1; >         proxy_send_timeout 1; >         proxy_read_timeout 1; >  >         body_filter_by_lua_block { >             if ngx.arg[2] then >                 skywalking_tracer:finish() >             end >         } >  >         log_by_lua_block { >             skywalking_tracer:prepareForReport() >         } >     }     the proxy_read_timeout config is 1s, but if upstream reponse time more than that, nginx will has error log  >  upstream timed out (110: Connection timed out) while reading response header from upstream, xxxxxxxxxx    In this case, the http request will not execute body_filter_by_lua phase, skywalking_tracer:finish() function is not be called also.    So skywalking_tracer:finish() should execute in log_by_lua_block, in order to record upsteam status correctly.   I tried to call skywalking_tracer:finish() in log_by_lua_block, it's work in this case.","closed","Nginx,","yxudong","2021-05-24T13:51:25Z","2021-06-10T06:55:37Z"

Inserting copyright notice into Python files. License text, specified in .licenserc.yaml isn't taken as-is by the tool. Specifically, the tool adds 1 extra empty line `before` the license text, but `ignores/deletes` empty lines `after` the license text, making it impossible to separate the license text from the code in the file. ___ ### Requirement or improvement  When I specify license text in .licenserc.yaml, I should be able to use mechanisms provided by yaml to specify empty lines before or after the license text, if I want to. The tool should not add anything on its own and should not strip anything out. Yaml provides annotation/markup to control how new line characters and spaces are handled within multi-line values. Specifically, I could use `|+' to specify a multiline value (i.e. License text), and that should include any trailing new line characters or spaces. Those should not be stripped out. However, the tool does strip them out.  So, if in .licenserc.yaml file I have the following License text:  ```     content: |+       Copyright blah blah        All rights reserved.        Some company, Inc. Confidential.        More text here...     paths: ``` then when the tool inserts this text into a Python file, I end up with this:  ``` # # Copyright blah blah # # All rights reserved. # # Some company, Inc. Confidential. # # More text here... FIRST LINE OF CODE HERE ```  As you can see, the tool added 1 empty line `before` the license text and `stripped` the extra empty line that I have in the yaml file. As a result, the License text is glued right to the first line of code in the file, and I have no way to add an extra empty line commented out with `#` there. I think the tool should honor the exact license text that's in the yaml file. Without adding or deleting anything.  Thanks!","closed","license eye,","mikhail-dr","2021-08-24T16:27:03Z","2021-08-25T17:05:42Z"

"","6625","make apm-toolkit-trace support a a programmatic interface","Please answer these questions before submitting your issue.  - Why do you submit this issue? - [ ] Question or discussion - [ ] Bug - [x] Requirement - [ ] Feature or performance improvement ___ # Requirement I want to pragmatically instrument Java code. There are possible two ways to do it.   ## gRPC API This approach uses gPRC API to report segments to the OAP server. This approach is similar to [go2sky]. But there is a problem with it. The spans create by gPRC API can‘t be related to the spans created by the Java agent. Consider the following example:  ```Java @GetMapping(""/greeting"") public String greeting() {    foo();    return ""hello""; } private void foo() {    // Create a span B.    // Report a segment which contains span B to the OAP server with gRPC  } ``` Java agent creates an entry span A for the greeting method A. And a segment that contains span A is reported to the OAP server by Java agent. There will be no ChildOf relation created between span A and span B  since Java agent and gRPC API do the instrument separately. In one word, this approach does not integrate well with the automatic instrument by Java agent.  ## apm-toolkit-trace [apm-toolkit-trace] uses Java annotations to create tracing data such as span, log, and tag. For example, we can use `@Trace` annotation to create a span for bar method:  ```Java @Trace public void bar() { } ``` The problem is that I can't decide whether to create a span for bar at runtime. For example, I want to disable span creation for bar method by default. After I turn on some flag, I want to create spans for the invocation of the method bar.  So the existing approaches do not solve my problem. I want to implement the following feature by extending apm-toolkit-trace module. My idea is to add the following APIs to  apm-toolkit-trace module (This API list is incomplete. If this design makes sense, I will make a complete API list for review):  - createLoalSpan - createEntrySpan - createExitSpan - stopSpan  The above methods essentially do the same thing as the aforementioned annotations. For example, createLoalSpan and stopSpan can do the same thing as `@Trace` annotation. In summary, my idea is to provide a programmatic interface for the functionalities which have existed in apm-toolkit-trace module.

For example, a `%traceId` placeholdder is replaced with `TID: df16a9001ca34cafbe23cbc5751c0d66.96.16206346254060001` in [log4j-2.x][1]. It is hard to extract `df16a9001ca34cafbe23cbc5751c0d66.96.16206346254060001` from `TID: df16a9001ca34cafbe23cbc5751c0d66.96.16206346254060001` when such log  messages are injected into ELK or Aliyun SLS.  But if `%traceId` means `real_trace_id`, the extraction is trival. And if we want something like `TID: real_trace_id`, we can write `TID: %traceId` in log4j-2.x's PatternLayout.  Is it possible to make `%traceId` pattern configurable?

When the dynamic data source is configured, the added rule will be synchronized to the dynamic data source   2. When the dynamic data source is not configured, the added rules will only exist in the memory   In the future, we may be able to visualize other configurations as well, so that users can use skywalking more conveniently.","closed","question,","liqiangz","2021-04-10T06:18:56Z","2021-04-10T07:02:08Z"

The topology display is incomplete.  For example:   Service A calls service B through the gateway. Select service A in the topology, it shows this:  ``` A --> Gateway ```  Select service B in the topology, it shows this:  ``` Gateway --> B ```  But I think the desired topology should be like this:  ``` A --> B ```  Here is another complicated example: Service A calls service B through the gateway. Service C calls service D through the gateway.  If services A, B, and D are in a group, and this group is selected in the topology, it shows this:  ```                          A --> Gateway --> B          |          ↓          D ```  It is easy to be misunderstood that service A calls service D through the gateway.","closed","question,","heihaozi","2021-06-23T09:34:34Z","2021-06-23T12:01:50Z"

For example, let's say I want to extract the service name from the label `service.istio.io/canonical-name` but I want to fall back into `app.kubernetes.io/name` or `app` labels if the first one is not defined. Allowing a comma-separated value in the config file would be enough to what needs to be processed to find the service name in this case. The config file would look like this: ```yaml serviceName: ${LABELS.""service.istio.io/canonical-name""},${LABELS.""app.kubernetes.io/name""},${LABELS.""app""} serviceInstanceName: ${NAME} ```  This is just a suggestion, any other implementation covering the requirement is welcome.","closed","enhancement,","sergicastro","2021-05-06T10:51:00Z","2021-05-12T22:53:06Z"

But Obviously, there isn't *config/ Alarm -settings.yml* within the project. *dist-material/alarm-settings.yml* and *oap-server/server-bootstrap/src/main/resources/alarm-settings.yml* are found instead(except *oap-server/server-alarm-plugin/src/test/resources/alarm-settings.yml*)   So it's due to the version? In the old version the config file is in the dir *config* but changed now, while the docs haven't been updated yet. If so, which config file should I take to bring in Alarm rule? Much confused!","closed","question,","CaptineNemo","2021-03-29T09:28:13Z","2021-03-30T06:37:12Z"

We have used SkyWalking with our Java Applications in production serval mouths, it runs fine mostly. Recently, we found some applications occur with frequent GC and some occur OOM. We dump the memory heap and use [Memory Analyzer (MAT)](https://www.eclipse.org/mat/) find there has a lot of `TraceSegmentRef` Object in the heap. Here are two cases as follows:  #### Case 1: Frequency GC  In this case, the app has 1000 Dubbo handler threads, each handler will do a lot RPCs and DB operations. - JVM Max Heap:  8g - Machine: 8 core 16g - SkyWalking Agent: 8.4.0, collect all traces  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8198862/113844121-bfac7000-97c6-11eb-8db2-580863c87cca.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8198862/113843193-f5048e00-97c5-11eb-8cd5-75a1ad543cc7.png)   #### Case 2: OOM  In this case, the app has 20 RocketMQ consume threads, in the consume thread, it will do some RPCs and DB operations. - JVM Max Heap:  8g - Machine: 8 core 16g - SkyWalking Agent: 8.4.0, collect all traces  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8198862/113843899-912e9500-97c6-11eb-93db-4a955b9129fa.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8198862/113843489-31d08500-97c6-11eb-9492-9bfa28284c81.png)  ---  On the application side, I think there have 3 reasons: 1. sudden high throughput will cause all threads busy to handle requests. 2. each request handle has a lot of RPCs and DB operations, cause create a lot of spans 3. Handle requests slowly, some will elapse 10s even more.  On the agent side, I have read the source code and know some design: - The `Segment` in the SkyWalking concept, is the Object in the RingBuffer on the client-side, and SkyWalking has a consume thread consume the RingBuffer data send to the OAP. - Before put the `Segment` Object in the RingBuffer, will build it first. Each request will create some spans, and there are put in the stack data structure, the `Segment` will finish building utils the stack empty, which means the request in the application has finished. It will take some time. Meanwhile, the data will keep in the thread-local. And the garbage collector cannot collect them before the request finished.  I wonder why put the segment in the ring buffer, could we put the span? I don't familiar with the Segment design purpose. And I know we should improve our application at the same time, but in some scenarios, people can tolerate it, even though handling requests slowly. So how SkyWalking Java Agent can do in such extreme scenarios? Because the application availability is very important, all of us won't hope the APM instrument occupies a lot of memory.","closed","enhancement,","nisiyong","2021-04-07T10:35:22Z","2021-04-14T15:51:19Z"

The zeebeBroker used in `plugin-scenario` is a service built on the external network by me. Is there any way to mock zeebe broker in the `zeebe-plugin-scenario`. It seems impossible to deploy zeebe through docker, and it seems unreasonable to place zeebe packages into `zeebe-plugin-scenario` directly.  --- ### Requirement or improvement  * Please describe your requirements or improvement suggestions.  # Summary  `Zeebe` is a workflow engine from Camunda, designed to meet the scalability requirements of high-performance applications running on cloud-native software architectures and to support workflows that span multiple microservices in low latency, high-throughput scenarios. When we use zeebe for service orchestration, due to the lack of support for the zeebe plugin, the span of the process instance will be disconnected from the corresponding Jobwork, forming mutually independent spans.  For easy understanding, we imagine the following scenario:  The user accessed service A through the gateway, and service A created a process instance through service B. JobWorker activates an internal task by polling ZeebeBroker, which in turn calls other services such as kafka. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126644037-e65ed15e-7bf1-4d59-b9a7-f91474cc3a1b.png)   Without the `zeebe-client-plugin`, when the scenario is displayed in skywalking, the spans of several locations in the figure below will be disconnected, forming serval independent spans. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126644050-d39fc172-388a-4974-b6ea-2ef2a17cbfdb.png)  Without the `zeebe-client-plugin`,the spans generated by the creation of process variables and the execution of their corresponding JobWorker can be connected in series. And make the service ZeebeBroker transparent, because in actual scenarios, we don’t care about the internal processing logic of ZeebeBroker. Just like this:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126644086-0ac66171-7f7b-4096-853a-d94a6554cf18.png)  The final span display result is similar to the following: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126644115-83c7960d-9117-4c4d-99e4-2f4ad257f290.png)  Service A creates a process instance named process_id through `CreateWorkflowInstance`(). And the process instance is executed by the JobWorker whose type is activateJob. Finally, the remote api service is called inside JobWorker.  # how to desgin  Before create process instance, we create an ExitSpan and put the contextCarrier into process variables of zeebe.  Before execute Job, we get the contextCarrier and restore context.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126644143-3092394e-141a-460c-82a5-b95336b6b40e.png)  why we use process variable?  ZeebeBroker is too complicated, a simple schematic diagram is as follows:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126754284-7d85c003-8935-4875-a8a4-f81e71b7300d.png)  If we choose to directly enhance on ZeebeBroker, we need a lot of enhancement points. High difficulty on the one hand, low efficiency on the other  # test results in UI  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55177318/126730240-5d495f91-83c9-4d84-aba9-b74b233027ee.png)   # Issues to be discussed  The zeebeBroker used in `plugin-scenario` is a service built on the external network by me. Is there any way to mock zeebe broker in the `zeebe-plugin-scenario`.

Most of config and components are the default ones, except  the following config in agent.config  agent.service_name=petclinic collector.backend_service=10.xx.xx.xx:11800 agent.sample_n_per_3_secs=500  Setup the basic backend, did the above config in agent. Started the petclinic project and visited few UI pages to generate some trace. After some time, when checked in skywalking UI didn't see any thing in trace, but petclinic is listed in the service. Not sure if I missed any thing?. I have checked the following.  1) There was <20 min time difference was there between agent and the collector, I had extended the time interval of the query in UI to include for 3 days (a day before and a day after). So it shouldn't be a problem.  2) connection is available between agent and collector, in fact service name configured in agent is listed in Skywalking UI.  3) No error/issue seen in collector logs            2021-08-08 10:07:00,702 -

"","6836","Questions about Agent Sampling logic","I have some questions about the agent sampling logic when I'm reading the code of `SamplingService.java` today:  1. I don't see the effect of `forceSampled()` method. It just increase the `samplingFactorHolder`, but the vacancy space it left can not be used by current request. The only effect it seems just making the sampling result count decrease 1 in current period, And the current request still need to compete for sampling in high concurrency scenario, it seems not so helpful for current request's sampling. 2. The `trySampling` method use CAS, In extreme situation, It may result in some requests be ignored but sum of  the sampled requests even less than the threshold set by `SAMPLE_N_PER_3_SECS` in this period. Will it?  ### Background I know the agent sampling exist to avoid extreme huge request make cpu and network overload. And the backend sampling to store a part of traces to reduce storage cost. What I want to do is saving the error traces 100% while opening the backend sampling to save the storage cost. This is a common demand in distributed tracing system.  As different service report data respectively in one request, they don't know if each other contains exception.  The common practice is using downstream feedback mechanism. For example, if there is an invocation chain like: A -> B -> C, if C caught an exception and make it's segment be force sampled. Then it can set a flag in the response, B found the flag from the response and also set force sampling and then propagation the flag to A. This mechanism can promise the exception trace(except the branch of the invocation tree) be sampled 100% and it may be very helpful for problem troubleshooting.  Hope SkyWalking have this feature.","closed","discussion,","honganan","2021-04-26T06:42:47Z","2021-05-26T16:11:28Z"

"","6766","[Bug]EndpointNameGrouping in SourceBuilder may not work","I glad to found the `EndpointNameGrouping` feature, and it can really solve problems that many enterprises will face. ### Bug `SourceBuilder` using `NamingControl` to do endpoint name length format and `end-name-grouping` when `setSourceEndpointName` or `setDestEndpointName` invoked. But `NameControl` dependence on `serviceName` to finish the group matching according to the code: ```java     @Getter     private String destServiceName;      public void setDestServiceName(final String destServiceName) {         this.destServiceName = namingControl.formatServiceName(destServiceName);     }      @Getter     @Setter     private NodeType destNodeType;     @Getter     private String destServiceInstanceName;      public void setDestServiceInstanceName(final String destServiceInstanceName) {         this.destServiceInstanceName = namingControl.formatServiceName(destServiceInstanceName);     } ``` But at this time the `serviceName` may not have been set. When using `SourceBuilder` in `MultiScopesAnalysisListener`, there are many place that set endpoint name first and service name later, like L118~L120  ```java sourceBuilder.setDestEndpointName(span.getOperationName()); sourceBuilder.setDestServiceInstanceName(segmentObject.getServiceInstance()); sourceBuilder.setDestServiceName(segmentObject.getService()); ```  ### Requirement or improvement The fastest way to solve is change the set methods invoking order. But it's too easy to make a mistake as it depends on set method calling order. I suggest adding a `namingFormat()` method in `SourceBuilder` and call it manually after all properties are set.

"","6915","Introduce method interceptor API v2","Hi @apache/skywalking-committers   We have a very stable and powerful plugin for 4 years, all of our plugins are being built on top of it. With more scenarios reported, I noticed there is a small gap we should fill. In `InstanceMethodsAroundInterceptor` and `StaticMethodsAroundInterceptor` have `before` and `after` methods, if we want to propagate information between them in one intercepting operation, we right now have 1. Dynamic field 2. RunnintContext 3. Enhanced parameter  But when we face concurrency calling of one instance, highly performance-sensitive, and only have `primitive data types` and `string` as parameter, all above three are not good options.  So, we should consider to provide a new instance/static method interceptor API(v2) like this. ```java /**  * A interceptor, which intercept method's invocation. The target methods will be defined in {@link  * ClassEnhancePluginDefine}'s subclass, most likely in {@link ClassInstanceMethodsEnhancePluginDefine}  */ public interface InstanceMethodsAroundInterceptorV2 {     /**      * called before target method invocation.      *      * @param result change this result, if you want to truncate the method.      */     void beforeMethod(EnhancedInstance objInst, Method method, Object[] allArguments, Class[] argumentsTypes,         MethodInterceptResult result, MethodInvocationContext mic) throws Throwable;      /**      * called after target method invocation. Even method's invocation triggers an exception.      *      * @param ret the method's original return value. May be null if the method triggers an exception.      * @return the method's actual return value.      */     Object afterMethod(EnhancedInstance objInst, Method method, Object[] allArguments, Class[] argumentsTypes,         Object ret, MethodInvocationContext mic) throws Throwable;      /**      * called when occur exception.      *      * @param t the exception occur.      */     void handleMethodException(EnhancedInstance objInst, Method method, Object[] allArguments,         Class[] argumentsTypes, Throwable t, MethodInvocationContext mic); } ```  A new object of `class MethodInvocationContext` is shared per method invocation, which should be created and managed by core inter(s), such as `InstMethodsInter`.  With this, we could share status in the method static and 100% isolation with other methods and static. When we use this with RuntimeContext, in `afterMethod` and `handleMethodException`, we could be easy to know whether some variable in the RunningContext is put or updated by `beforeMethod`.  Notice, this change also affects the bootstrap instrumentation, so, we need the v2 inter templates too.  ___ To anyone who wants to handle this, you should know, this is a very core level API enhancement. We expect 100% forward compatibility and will accept the new plugin implementing either in v1 or v2 APIs. v1 may not be removed ever.  This task only recommends to SkyWalking committer or you are confident you have already known SkyWalking's agent core very well. Newcomers, please don't try this.","closed","complexity:high,","wu-sheng","2021-05-08T12:36:46Z","2021-05-20T05:36:13Z"

The OAL was introduced from 6.0 to make SkyWalking more flexible in agent and mesh scenarios. With all 3 years, we moved the SkyWalking from agent tracing analysis to service mesh covered. Now, SkyWalking support metrics, traces, logs, and event all in one. But also, with time, I noticed, the OAL is not a little too heavier, as many binary codes(classes) generated in the runtime. Currently 8.2 to 8.5 releases, we added MAL and LAL, which is groovy based, lighter, and more powerful, also if #6897 works, it has a super important advantage, which OAL is much harder to achieve.  So, I and @kezhenxu94 discussed the possibility to replace OAL with MAL today. It seems practical.   I open this issue to track when would we and how will lead on this.

"","7280","[SkyWalking 10] Service Architecture-Layer Concept","Hi @apache/skywalking-committers   I am writing this issue and created 10.0.0 milestone to track for long-term ideas. We are going to maintain and enhance SkyWalking 8.x and reserve 9.x for possible breaking upgrades. So, SkyWalking 10 would be the next core-level features and architecture-related version.  The first idea in mine and @Fine0830 's mind is a new and powerful UI, with all existing monitoring targets that would work together. Currently, we have in-process agents, mesh-controlled services/pods, k8s nodes, VM(OS) nodes. In real architecture, they are in different layers physically.  1. Language agents monitoring services are in-process level, which is the code and method level monitoring. They are on the top of VM(OS) or in a pod managed by k8s, even service mesh 2. Mesh-controlled services are in k8s pod or VM. 3. K8s nodes are on VM(OS) nodes.  Also, we could have higher lever layer, such as  1. `Versioned service` to group service instances based on CD and version control system 2. `Cluster` to group services based on physical deployment.  Each instance could have layer concepts, including `on top of` and `contains` 2 types. 1. `on top of` could represent a service instance that is running on a VM node. 2. `contains` could represent a k8s node containing several images.  For filling this relationship, each level's agents should enhance the capabilities to build this kind of link.  Service should aggregate instances' layers(2 directions) together, and automatically splits into different logic service group to represent different groups of instances which have same layer information.   To @Fine0830, UI should have a totally different layout, the first level should be dynamic layers, then each layer should provide supported observability data, such as whether  1. Traces/logs are available 2. Events detected 3. Metrics dashboards  All these things are dynamic in the runtime. Alarms should be another one on the top level, but be able to link to a specific service/instance in a specific layer.  Also, we should have a layer map, from top to bottom, such as this(only a demo) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/125166717-73126f80-e1cf-11eb-82b2-61084da5669f.png) But also, should accept those layers could have more than one of this scenograph.  ___  All above changes are compatible at the protocol level, as layers could be assigned at the backend or using new fields.

Since you are using requests library in your project, you are affected. It's not as bad for you as you seem to use requests library optionally (when `http` extra is used) and LGPL dependencies can be used if they are optional, however it would be safer if you use non-LGPL dependency also here).  As discussed at length in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-572 we found out that the `chardet` ibrary used by `requests` library was a mandatory dependency to requests and since it has LGPL licence, we should not release any Apache Software with it.   Since then (and since in Airflow we rely on requests heavily) we have been working with the requests maintainers and ""charset-normalizer"" maintainer to make it possible to replace chardet with MIT-licensed charset-normalizer instead so that requests library can be used in Python releases by Apache projects.  This was a bumpy road but finally the PR by @ashb has been merged: https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5797 and we hope soon a new version of requests library will be released.   This is just a heads-up. I will let you know when it is released, but I have a kind requests as well - I might ask the maintainers to release a release candidate of requests and maybe you could help to test it before it is released, that would be some re-assurance for the maintainers of requests who are very concerned about stability of their releases.  Let me know if you need any more information and whether you would like to help in testing the candidate when it is out.","closed","python,","potiuk","2021-07-11T13:39:12Z","2021-08-04T02:09:36Z"

"","7174","Can I use  WeChat Hook sent messages via http proxy?","Dear Sheng WU,and other teachers:     I have set up a k8s cluster in local network  that can be not connected to the Internet, and I use Helm to install skywalking in my k8s cluster, and I choose the  WeChat Hook in alarm-settings.yml as the way to sent alarm messages to the wechat enpterprise edtion, as you know that my k8s cluster can not connect to the Internet,So if you don't use http proxy, you won't be able to send alerts to enterprise wechat, but I can't find any configuration parameters for http proxy in the configuration file, so how am I supposed to send out an alert on the k8s Lan through another proxy server that's connected to the outside network.    I tried to add an env http-proxy in my deplyment skywalking-oap ,and change the network to  hostNetwork, but it still fails.

With more configurations being dynamic, we may not provide all keys, such as all MAL scripts.  @wankai123 @mrproliu @kezhenxu94 @dmsolr or other @apache/skywalking-committers do we have any ideas about how to add another dynamic configuration API for a set of data?  I don't think we have to keep compatible with the existing one, the keys about this feature are  1. Watcher could indicate a name/key for multiple items. 2.

As we know, we have HTTP 1/2 supported through the ALS, TCP in theory should be very similar, but the metrics could be very different, such as package/s, reconnecting rate.  @kezhenxu94 Base on current features, we could provide topology with TCP in analysis and query. But we should add new dashboard for TCP metrics of service in the `apm` panel.  @Fine0830 The biggest change this time is the metrics of nodes and line in the topology, it should be determined by  1. Node types, https://github.com/apache/skywalking-query-protocol/blob/42d6783d8c1a0d0d4c2b28e58dc1f47dd554964e/topology.graphqls#L46 2. Call types(sourceComponents and targetComponents) https://github.com/apache/skywalking-query-protocol/blob/master/topology.graphqls#L92-L95  All services(default) keep as same as today. For specific type, at this time, is TCP(we could have more in the future). UI should support load metrics for nodes and lines from different metrics(different names, protocol, and parameters are nearly the same) and different buttons(when clicking node, less than the default, so only a subset). But the same button(such as instance) should load different UI template, such as `TOPOLOGY_INSTANCE_TCP`  Note, this is a feature for **8.6.0** release, if @kezhenxu94 @hanahmily @Fine0830 @wankai123 have any concern about this, please let me know.

"","6897","Support hot update of LAL and MAL","@kezhenxu94 For better 3rd party integration, we still need to evaluate the ways to update LAL and MAL in the runtime. Of course, the OAL should be on the radar, but considering it is heavier than these two, let's focus on LAL and MAL now. I have talked with people around about the MAL and LAL use case, this is really required because people are keeping add metrics analysis with time.  From a tech perspective, groovy should be easy to support, the biggest challenge is about the streaming process. We need to support uninstall the existing process and tolerate `worker not found` in `RemoteServiceHandler`.  Also, the update should be supported in 2 ways. 1. Dynamic configuration setting, like alarm setting. 2. File change monitoring(`MultipleFilesChangeMonitor`), then, in single-node mode or dev mode, we don't need to use (1), as it is clearly more complex than directly changing file  I know, @kezhenxu94  have concerns about the security issue, we don't recommend definitely expose the script to the user, but use a system to assemble that. In further, we could have a better API set to assemble this script and avoid security issues.  At the last, about the storage format change, it is more about the MAL change, especially when face H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL, which could be a load for the storage, but once this is open, users should take care of it. New metrics installation about these 2, need to check whether the entity(table) exists, if yes, we should follow a new config to determine whether OAP should `delete the entity` or `reject the change and output an error log`.  @apache/skywalking-committers Welcome to discuss and comment.

"","7112","Add debug services(GraphQL) in query protocol","@kezhenxu94 @hanahmily We have been suffering the runtime debugging issues in the prod env for months. I want to discuss whether we should consider adding a new type of GraphQL service, named `debug`.  `debug` catalog should be a group of interactive services, provided from OAP instance level. Because of this, no query should be done through UI webapp or load balancer.  A demo command of debug service should like this(Ignore the format, I don't write it in GraphQL grammar) > debug start --target als-k8s --duration 5m > debug statistic  > debug clear  We should work on a statistic API, very similar to the internal observability APIs, but because it only works after receiving the `start` command with a certain duration. Then, we could get the result as a statistic table until  1. The next `debug start` 2. `debug clear` 3. 20min(or another threshold value) passed.  FYI @apache/skywalking-committers You may notice we could use this in the agent trace/meter/log analysis statistic.   The major difference between `debug` API and `telemetry` APIs is not from a tech perspective, it is more from a usage scenario. The `debug` API implementation could be more aggressive and provide more context in on-demand debugging.","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2021-06-11T13:55:11Z","2021-06-12T04:28:32Z"

And this tag is only used in grpc-1.x-plugin to replace status code tag for now. 3. Oap server analyzer source add `responseCodeStr` field associated with response code tag.

Just to take a glance of this story, the simplest way to reproduce the problem is to run a spring boot application with [`spring-boot-devtools`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.16.RELEASE/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html) in IDEA.  ```xml      org.springframework.boot     spring-boot-devtools     runtime     true  ```  with a controller,  ```java package com.example.classloaderdemo.controller;  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;  @RestController public class HealthController {     @GetMapping(path = ""/healthz"")     public String health() {         return ""OK"";     } } ```  If we use [`Arthas`](https://arthas.aliyun.com/doc/index.html) to examine this particular class `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder`, we can find the following results,  ``` [arthas@22299]$ sc -d org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder  class-info        org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.JavaxServletRequestHolder  code-source  name              org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.JavaxServletRequestHolder  isInterface       false  isAnnotation      false  isEnum            false  isAnonymousClass  false  isArray           false  isLocalClass      false  isMemberClass     false  isPrimitive       false  isSynthetic       false  simple-name       JavaxServletRequestHolder  modifier          public  annotation  interfaces        org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder  super-class       +-java.lang.Object  class-loader      +-org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.loader.AgentClassLoader@6ba76699                      +-sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@18b4aac2                        +-sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader@3feba861  classLoaderHash   6ba76699   class-info        org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder  code-source  name              org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder  isInterface       true  isAnnotation      false  isEnum            false  isAnonymousClass  false  isArray           false  isLocalClass      false  isMemberClass     false  isPrimitive       false  isSynthetic       false  simple-name       RequestHolder  modifier          abstract,interface,public  annotation  interfaces  super-class  class-loader      +-org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.loader.AgentClassLoader@77f6031b                      +-org.springframework.boot.devtools.restart.classloader.RestartClassLoader@6bce6c13                        +-sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@18b4aac2                          +-sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader@3feba861  classLoaderHash   77f6031b   class-info        org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder  code-source  name              org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder  isInterface       true  isAnnotation      false  isEnum            false  isAnonymousClass  false  isArray           false  isLocalClass      false  isMemberClass     false  isPrimitive       false  isSynthetic       false  simple-name       RequestHolder  modifier          abstract,interface,public  annotation  interfaces  super-class  class-loader      +-org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.loader.AgentClassLoader@6ba76699                      +-sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@18b4aac2                        +-sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader@3feba861  classLoaderHash   6ba76699  Affect(row-cnt:3) cost in 30 ms. ```  1. `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.JavaxServletRequestHolder` together with its parent `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.RequestHolder` appear to be loaded by the `AgentClassLoader@6ba76699`. This happened when the spring internal class `org.springframework.web.method.HandlerMethod#getBean` was enhanced since the `HandlerMethod` class was loaded by `AppClassLoader`. 2. Afterwards, the `RestController` annotation is captured. However, the controller class `HealthController` is loaded by another classloader `org.springframework.boot.devtools.restart.classloader.RestartClassLoader@6bce6c13` which further causes the Skywalking agent to create a new instance of AgentClassLoader, i.e. `AgentClassLoader@77f6031b`.  Finally, since `RequestHolder` sits in both two classloaders, they are not the same one, thus not inter-changeable.  ___ ### Requirement or improvement  As a conclusion, the root-cause of the problem is the abstraction of `RequestHolder` which **exists in the plugin** and will be potentially loaded by different instances of `AgentClassLoader`.  But I suppose the abstraction can be fully removed since we only take advantage of it in `AbstractMethodInterceptor`.  If so, I believe this issue can be resolved, since either `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` or `org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpResponse` can be only loaded by the same classloader due to the   parent delegation model, e.g. `AppClassLoader` or [`org.springframework.boot.loader.LaunchedURLClassLoader`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/loader/LaunchedURLClassLoader.html) in spring boot execution environment.","closed","plugin,","lujiajing1126","2021-05-18T10:14:12Z","2021-05-22T09:06:14Z"

"","7440","Discussion about multi-interceptors supporting in SkyWalking","- Discussion : multi-interceptors supporting in SkyWalking  As I have mentioned in [https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6932#issuecomment-895825310](url)。  For extensibility of SkyWaling, we should support multi-interceptors。  I have two ways of doing this：  # the first one We can construct multiple ClassFileTransformer instances. In each ClassFileTransformer, there will only be one pluginDefine for each class.To do this, we should group the plugindefine,and we will construct a ClassFileTransformer instance for each group. The code might look something like this  ```java List pluginFinders = groupByPluginDefine(); for (PluginFinder finder : pluginFinders) {     agentBuilder.type(finder.buildMatch())         .transform(new Transformer(finder))         .with(AgentBuilder.RedefinitionStrategy.RETRANSFORMATION)         .with(new Listener())         .installOn(instrumentation); } ``` What the method named groupByPluginDefine method does is group the pluginDefine, and promise only one pluginDefine for each class per group.  # the second one I have debugged code, and found the reason is every time a class is enhanced, it will delegate the original method to a new InstMethodsInter instance. So, the previous is overridden.  ![image-20210811135321186](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210811135321186.png)  To solve it, maybe we can cache the interceptor and merge them.  Finally, I also looked for new apis in ByteBuddy as an alternative to `MethodDelegation`. but,I am newer for it.This will be a long time. This is my whole idea.I hope some seniors can give me some advice. Thanks.","closed","discussion,","daimingzhi","2021-08-11T06:04:35Z","2021-08-19T08:57:07Z"

When I used the mysql-connector-java SDK version 8.0.19 or above and enable `jdbc:mysql:replication`, I got the following exception.

And because of the logic of `combine` method in `InstanceTraffic`, we will continue to use the older `timeBucket` when updating.     This causes OAP to update `InstanceTraffic` and report an error after cleaning up the index related to `InstanceTraffic` that has reached the specified TTL.

By default, .git and the content in .gitignore will be inflated into the paths-ignore list.  I found this at doc, https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes#configurations.  So, according to doc, this is a bug.   But I would be very surprised about this folder includes actually managed files. @spacewander I think this feature was designed to skip local(never submitted files).   ___ @kezhenxu94 @fgksgf I would treat APISIX's use case as a very specific leak case for header check. It is better to provide a `local-mode`(or any better name) to accept git ignore file.  Once you have a resolution, you could create a bug/feature issue with good explanations about how we should fix this. Or we could continue the discussion here.  _Originally posted by @wu-sheng in https://github.com/apache/skywalking/discussions/7542#discussioncomment-1222951_","closed","license eye,","wu-sheng","2021-08-23T15:17:19Z","2021-09-08T06:05:36Z"

See the [Line 80](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/4eb37d4d53cd77e173f3e1d418ba7fe7afe5a8a3/oap-server/server-storage-plugin/storage-influxdb-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/storage/plugin/influxdb/query/ProfileThreadSnapshotQuery.java#L80). It uses **the `bottom` function** for `SegmentRecord.START_TIME`. The bottom function means adopts ASC order. However, the corresponding implementation of H2 and ES use DESC order. See the [H2 implementation](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/4eb37d4d53cd77e173f3e1d418ba7fe7afe5a8a3/oap-server/server-storage-plugin/storage-jdbc-hikaricp-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/storage/plugin/jdbc/h2/dao/H2ProfileThreadSnapshotQueryDAO.java#L84) and the [ES implementation](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/4eb37d4d53cd77e173f3e1d418ba7fe7afe5a8a3/oap-server/server-storage-plugin/storage-elasticsearch-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/storage/plugin/elasticsearch/query/ProfileThreadSnapshotQueryEsDAO.java#L101)  ### What you expected to happen  The [Line 80](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/4eb37d4d53cd77e173f3e1d418ba7fe7afe5a8a3/oap-server/server-storage-plugin/storage-influxdb-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/storage/plugin/influxdb/query/ProfileThreadSnapshotQuery.java#L80) of ProfileThreadSnapshotQuery should adopt DESC order.

We separate the repo to ease the release process and CI load(of course, also because Java agent is very stable right now).  We have good experience after the splitting. But now, it has increased to 30mins. Mostly this is caused by dynamic configuration features are enhanced, and more reasonable integration tests have been added.

Typically, we faced questions and help requests, such as @andrewgkew 's https://github.com/apache/skywalking/discussions/7555, and many others in English and Chinese. Sometimes, it is really hard to locate the issue, and share the details about how to deploy the whole SkyWalking covering most features.  This afternoon, we discussed about this, and showcase repository idea comes out by @hanahmily @kezhenxu94 and me. This repo aims to provide source codes and scripts(maybe some codes) to provide out-of-box deployment for all features, including all components of SkyWalking, related ecosystem components(OpenTelemetry, Fluentd etc.) and example/demo applications.  All deployments are going to build on the top of k8s(including k8s cloud service, minikube, kind, etc.), which reduces the complexity of infra environments.  @kezhenxu94 will lead to establish the codebase and project structure, then people could join to enhance. @hanahmily, as a mentor of Summer 2021 Open Source Program, has students who want to contribute more to the community, rather than the required tasks. We are welcome and glad they love the community. They have some ideas to enhance the deployment, such as recent added SWCK to do sidecar injection for the Java agent, etc.  Further more, http://demo.skywalking.apache.org will be setup by using this showcase directly.   We hope this could benefit the whole community, and ease the works of maintainers' daily works.

Closes #. - [ ] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).  From skywalking 8.4.0, witness method has been introduced. This feature enables those plugins to conduct enhancements only if some specific methods are found.  In our scenarios, we would like to enhance some classes in Kafka client module, but only if `public Object metricValue()` can be found in the `KafkaMetric` class (which means Kafka version >= 1.0.0) since we are using this method in plugin.  Also, we want to make enhancements targeting legacy Kafka versions (< 1.0.0) with other different interceptors.  The most intuitive way is to do the opposite, searching for `KafkaMetric` class but without `public Object metricValue()` method. However, this method is not support yet in Skywalking agent. Thus, this PR is to provide this possibility.  Currently, we can do this in the following ways,  - use `MethodUtil.isMethodExist` during the runtime like what we have done in Tomcat, Jetty plugins for servlet version compatibility. - in this specific case, we can check `@Deprecation` annotation on `@Deprecated public double value()` method. But this method will be totally removed in the next major release due to [KAFKA-12573](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10425)  I suppose this PR can make improvement to the `WitnessMethod` feature.","closed","don't merge,","lujiajing1126","2021-04-01T10:04:22Z","2021-04-10T14:18:37Z"
