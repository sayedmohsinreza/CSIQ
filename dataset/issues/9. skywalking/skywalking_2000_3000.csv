The first idea could be traced back to the time I joined SkyWalking, which still was Sheng's personal project. The main architecture is discussed in my graduate thesis in 2017, with the title of ""The design and implement of tracing database system"". In that paper, I discussed a potential database implementation to handling tracing data and design an abstract model to save the data.  After that, several issues blocked me from pushing this work till I figured them out about one month ago. Simultaneously, the debate of the ES's license transferring caused Sheng and me to decide to kick the project off.  In recent weeks, I composed a list[2] to trace the main ideas and tech stacks that could affect the final architecture. If you have any ideas, feel free to comment on them.  From my perspective, we would verify some potential data modals before starting the design. Based on that, I begin a study[2] to choose an idea data modal from several candidates. In this study, I should set up some stimulation workloads to test data models. These workload designs need your help to make them as close to the real scenarios. If anyone has any ideas, pls let me know.  In the next few weeks, I will be on the study. Once some results merge, the community will get the updates.  1. https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6219#issue-787602819 2. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qzzJ3caBtAFmFBBoB0VoETqWAUMP2jSR4UR3C3Jykos/edit?usp=sharing 3. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bvvycAe1MlXKIJPdGUFBS8XDI7nPpIpI44RKwH_UkJc/edit?usp=sharing","closed","database,","wu-sheng","2021-02-04T01:22:16Z","2022-04-01T06:26:50Z"

FYI @hanahmily @kezhenxu94 cc @apache/skywalking-committers   In the implementation, I prefer, Prometheus eco-system agents -> OpenTelemetry collector --(OC format)--> OAP server.  Such as Prometheus node exporter, https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/ @hanahmily agree?  --- ~~At the backend side, we need to add a new `vm_traffic` to represent VMs and Machines, which should include~~ ~~1. name, entity id. IDManager should implement this.~~ ~~2. tags (JsonObject properties), like InstanceTraffic implemented.~~  ~~The key point of this is adding aggregation capability for MAL core. From my understanding the key point is adding `SampleFamily#vm` for new entity context, also `Analyzer#generateTraffic` should be enhanced to support the new aggregation type.~~  ~~After above finish, the UI(cc @Fine0830) will add a new kind of dashboard called `Infrastructure `, which just query `VM` list. NOTE, this is a query-protocol level change.~~  --- Based on https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6108#issuecomment-758311084, the change proposal in the above block is not necessary.

We use skywalking version 8.2.0, and use ES cluster to store data, five data nodes (cpu: 16 memery: 32G). But his QPS is only 2W at most, and ES throws EsRejectedExcutionException, so kafka has a lot of news accumulation. The highest accumulation reaches 200 million. After we made various optimizations to ES, we found that the effect was very small.   We will look at the code later and find that the segment data is written asynchronously and the metrics is written synchronously.     metrics persistence code in `org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.core.storage.PersistenceTimer.     It needs to use the previous storage for calculations, and it needs to query the previous data and can only be written synchronously.There are two problems:    1. Synchronous writing is very slow, and some data needs to be updated, which will block ES from processing other requests.   2. Synchronous writing does not limit the size of the requested data.    Later, we observed a phenomenon, a synchronous request has 2w data, which takes 10000ms, so ES will block the processing of this request, and if the time is too long, it will discard other asynchronous requests and throw EsRejectedExcutionException.  - How we solved it    We removed the writing of metrics data, so we also lost the metrics data in skywalking。    Because this kind of persistence will greatly affect the write performance, you can do calculations when querying and not doing calculations when writing. In this way, when we write data, we can write asynchronously, so QPS will be improved a lot, but this will change a lot. . .    The above are the problems I encountered in using skywalking and some suggestions of my own. : )","closed","question,","haoyann","2020-11-14T07:48:46Z","2020-11-14T07:54:58Z"

It seems that only `log(long, Map)`  can meet the requirements.  The current preliminary proposal is that the key is the name of log systems such as `logback` ,`log4j`, or `log4j2`. And its value is the content of the log message.  Just like this: ```java  ContextManager.activeSpan().log(System.currentTimeMillis(), (Map) new HashMap().put(""logback"",""formate log"")); ``` **But I am not sure if the above usage is correct.** Or through `AbstractSpan tag(AbstractTag tag, String value)` instead of log(long, Map) ?

For sampling, it seems currently (v8.2.0/v8.3.0) there are primarily 2 ways to control trace sampling. One is in server side using `sampleRate` but the bandwidth is still wasted and may not be very flexible if has many multiple sources of agent. The other is via agent side `agent.sample_n_per_3_secs` option but the use case is kind of counter-intuitive. In many scenarios one may want a percentage sampling rate option in agent side. What's the reason of not providing that but using a ""traces in 3 seconds"" mechanism instead? This looks a bit odd and from looking at the `SamplingService` code a percentage way would not be difficult to implement.    ___ ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS and JRE? v8.2.0 openjdk version ""1.8.0_265""  ___ ### Requirement or improvement - provide an agent config similar to `agent.sample_n_per_3_secs` but in percentage (like 10 in every 10000). We can try to implement this and open a PR if that's OK.","closed","discussion,","Frefreak","2020-12-12T07:22:58Z","2020-12-12T09:26:45Z"

Although there is a type mismatch in the second startup log, you will find that it is because the pinpoint type does not match. This is because both of them use bytecode enhancement technology, and from the source code document. It can be understood that there are problems with using the same technology. The processing above the source code is only to capture the exception and print it out in debug form. Generally, bytecode enhancement technology does not appear in our business logic.  ___ ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS, and JRE?  - Which company or project?  - What happened?

Hello, we are currently using skywalking for system monitoring, but because the amount of data reported by the agent is relatively large, we plan to connect to Kafka for data collection, but skywalking supports the agent to write directly to Kafka's topic by default. There are a lot of connect . Kafka limits the maximum number of connections to 100, and too many connections will also affect the performance of Kafka. So we thought of two design solutions, I hope you can help evaluate which solution is more suitable for future expansion and our applications Scenes . Figure 1 below is the current skywalking architecture. In the first solution, we plan to add a layer of kafka between oap and es. When writing, instead of writing to es, write to kafka, and then build a consumer to consume kafka to write Enter es, as shown in Figure 2. In the second scheme, we plan to add a layer of kafka producer between agent and oap, and the work is mainly to collect agent data and forward it to kafka. Hope to get your suggestions, thank you very much!  > ___ ![wtrace-kafka](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45945752/100404332-1a58f100-309c-11eb-9c0b-c61cad35050d.png)  ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS and JRE?  - Which company or project?  - What happened?

The following usages of KafkaTemplate  are used to send messages.  ```java // Without callback template.send(topic, msg);  // With callback template.execute(     (Producer producer) -> {       producer.send(           new ProducerRecord(topic, msg),           (RecordMetadata metadata, Exception e) -> {             if (e != null) {               System.out.println(""message sending failed"");             } else {               System.out.println(""message sending succeeded"");             }           });       return 0;     }); ```  agent/logs/skywalking-api.log has the following exception:  ``` ERROR 2021-02-25 20:36:23:117 kafka-producer-network-thread | producer-2 InstMethodsInter : class[class org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer$InterceptorCallback] before method[onCompletion] intercept failure java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.kafka.CallbackAdapterInterceptor cannot be cast to org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.interceptor.enhance.EnhancedInstance at org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.kafka.CallbackInterceptor.getSnapshot(CallbackInterceptor.java:83) at org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.kafka.CallbackInterceptor.beforeMethod(CallbackInterceptor.java:44) at org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.interceptor.enhance.InstMethodsInter.intercept(InstMethodsInter.java:76) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer$InterceptorCallback.onCompletion(KafkaProducer.java) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.ProducerBatch.completeFutureAndFireCallbacks(ProducerBatch.java:201) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.ProducerBatch.done(ProducerBatch.java:187) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.completeBatch(Sender.java:599) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.completeBatch(Sender.java:575) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.handleProduceResponse(Sender.java:485) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.access$100(Sender.java:74) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender$1.onComplete(Sender.java:700) at org.apache.kafka.clients.ClientResponse.onComplete(ClientResponse.java:109) at org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient.completeResponses(NetworkClient.java:532) at org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient.poll(NetworkClient.java:524) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.run(Sender.java:239) at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.run(Sender.java:163) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748) ```  ___ ### Possible fix  My guess is that the following branch of `KafkaProducerInterceptor.beforeMethod`' executed:  ```java             } else if (shouldCallbackInstance instanceof Callback) {                 Callback callback = (Callback) shouldCallbackInstance;                 ContextSnapshot snapshot = ContextManager.capture();                 if (null != snapshot) {                     CallbackCache cache = new CallbackCache();                     cache.setSnapshot(snapshot);                     cache.setCallback(callback);                     allArguments[1] = new CallbackAdapterInterceptor(cache);                 }             } ```  So when `CallbackInterceptor.getSnapshot` tried to cast cache.getCallback() to EnhancedInstance, a ClassCastException was thrown. One possible fix is to add a type check to CallbackConstructorInterceptor.onConstruct.  ```java     @Override     public void onConstruct(EnhancedInstance objInst, Object[] allArguments) {         Callback callback = (Callback) allArguments[0];         if (callback instanceof EnhancedInstance) {             CallbackCache cache;             if (null != objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField()) {                 cache = (CallbackCache) objInst.getSkyWalkingDynamicField();             } else {                 cache = new CallbackCache();             }             cache.setCallback(callback);             objInst.setSkyWalkingDynamicField(cache);         }     } ```   If some committers can give me some guidance, I will try to fix this issue.","closed","enhancement,","yaojingguo","2021-02-26T12:46:51Z","2021-03-01T04:49:55Z"

When no agent is added, cglib will only generate a cglib dynamic agent for ReCreateChatRoomJob. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16839929/104180476-22040780-5448-11eb-9a00-c3360021aee8.png) 2. When adding the agent, remotely debug the agent. At this time, it was found that the dynamic agent class of ReCreateChatRoomJob entered skywalking twice to enhance the bytecode.  Therefore, I dumped the bytecode of the two cglib dynamic proxy classes enhanced by skywalking and decompiled before the exception caused the application to exit. the first time: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16839929/104180579-524ba600-5448-11eb-8b58-f778b743ef04.png) the second time: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16839929/104180656-70190b00-5448-11eb-8bd7-e5505227b65f.png) From the above, we can know that cglib will nest in the process of doing dynamic proxy. When the first level of nesting is enhanced by skywalking, this class has implemented the EnhancedInstance class of skywalking, so it enters: org.springframework.aop.framework.CglibAopProxy#getProxy(java.lang.ClassLoader)  ``` if (ClassUtils.isCglibProxyClass(rootClass)) {    proxySuperClass = rootClass.getSuperclass();    Class[] additionalInterfaces = rootClass.getInterfaces();    for (Class additionalInterface : additionalInterfaces) {       this.advised.addInterface(additionalInterface);    } } ``` Since rootClass is already an EnhancedInstance class that implements skywalking, cglib is used to generate a dynamic proxy class again. When the generated dynamic proxy class triggers the skywalking bytecode interception process, it implements the EnhancedInstance interface, so the verification of this class fails and an exception occurs. App exit ``` /**  * Manipulate class source code.  *  * new class need:  * 1.Add field, name {@link #CONTEXT_ATTR_NAME}.  * 2.Add a field accessor for this field.  *  * And make sure the source codes manipulation only occurs once.  *  */ if (!context.isObjectExtended()) {     newClassBuilder = newClassBuilder.defineField(CONTEXT_ATTR_NAME, Object.class, ACC_PRIVATE | ACC_VOLATILE)                                      .implement(EnhancedInstance.class)                                      .intercept(FieldAccessor.ofField(CONTEXT_ATTR_NAME));     context.extendObjectCompleted(); } ``` Solve the problem:  1. It can be solved by setting the agent.is_open_debugging_class parameter of skywalking.config to true. This parameter sets whether bytebuddy performs bytecode verification.  2. Before the original isObjectExtended judgment, add another isAssignableTo to judge whether the current class is a subclass of EnhancedInstance ``` /**  * Manipulate class source code.  *  * new class need:  * 1.Add field, name {@link #CONTEXT_ATTR_NAME}.  * 2.Add a field accessor for this field.  *  * And make sure the source codes manipulation only occurs once.  *  */ if (!typeDescription.isAssignableTo(EnhancedInstance.class)) {     if (!context.isObjectExtended()) {         newClassBuilder = newClassBuilder.defineField(             CONTEXT_ATTR_NAME, Object.class, ACC_PRIVATE | ACC_VOLATILE)                                          .implement(EnhancedInstance.class)                                          .intercept(FieldAccessor.ofField(CONTEXT_ATTR_NAME));         context.extendObjectCompleted();     } } ```","closed","agent,","zifeihan","2021-01-11T11:56:01Z","2021-01-11T23:47:07Z"

So far the changes to HttpPlugin seem to be a big part, but not all of the problem. The thing is that http sits underneath all the other plugins and must account for the fact that they may override it, but there is more to the errors than just the plugin I think, I am investigating.

On Redis Lettuce span UI, only a Redis command keyword is displayed in 'db.statement' field（see below screenshot）, for example ""GET"", which is inconvenient for system monitoring. Suppose one sees tens of Redis spans in one trace, and he wants to know why and what are they. Unfortunately he can't get this currently in an accurate way. What he can get is a list of ""SET"" or ""GET"", but ""SET"" for what, ""GET"" for what, are unknown for him. So I create this issue to discuss this, supposed enhanced UI screenshots are possibly like shown in the last three pictures. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263555-75959b80-8caa-11eb-81cb-fef24bc95243.png)  Enhanced UI: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263577-80e8c700-8caa-11eb-85ea-a1346855e559.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263590-8514e480-8caa-11eb-8e76-1decd66d9c5e.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263600-880fd500-8caa-11eb-84fc-d2c75ac17ff6.png)","closed","plugin,","compilerduck","2021-03-24T06:23:05Z","2021-04-02T02:03:58Z"

"","6136","ReadWriteSafeCache simultaneous read-write support","Please answer these questions before submitting your issue.  - Why do you submit this issue? - [ ] Question or discussion - [ ] Bug - [ ] Requirement - [x] Feature or performance improvement  ___  ### Requirement or improvement - Please describe your requirements or improvement suggestions.  Currently, `ReadWriteSafeCache` holds two buffer pointers to read-buffer and write-buffer respectively. Writer thread write data to write-buffer, while reader thread read data from read-buffer. Pointers will be swapped after reading finished. All operations are controlled by one single `ReentrantLock`. As follows:  ```java public void write(List data) {     lock.lock();     try {         data.forEach(writeBufferPointer::accept);     } finally {         lock.unlock();     } }  public List read() {     lock.lock();     try {         // Switch the read and write pointers, when there is no writing.         BufferedData tempPointer = writeBufferPointer;         writeBufferPointer = readBufferPointer;         readBufferPointer = tempPointer;          return readBufferPointer.read();     } finally {         lock.unlock();     } } ```  I'm confused that why two buffers are used here. It seems like one single buffer can do the same job. Maybe the switchable buffers here are used for simultaneous read-write. But it's not possible with only one lock, cause all operations to `ReadWriteSafeCache` are blocked.  To support simultaneous read-write, I synchronize the operations with two locks, and move the swapping operations to writing method, just after writing operation is finished, only if read-buffer is empty. As follows:  ``` public void write(List data) {     writeBufferLock.lock();     try {         data.forEach(writeBufferPointer::accept);         try {             readBufferLock.lock();             if (readBufferPointer.isEmpty()) {                 switchPointers();             }         } finally {             readBufferLock.unlock();         }     } finally {         writeBufferLock.unlock();     } }  public List read() {     readBufferLock.lock();     try {         return readBufferPointer.read();     } finally {         readBufferLock.unlock();     } }  private void switchPointers() {     BufferedData tempPointer = writeBufferPointer;     writeBufferPointer = readBufferPointer;     readBufferPointer = tempPointer; } ```  Only swapping operation need to acquire two lock. Reading and writing operation just need to acquire their own lock. Empty check avoids unnecessary swapping and disorder problem of data.  It has some performance improvement if read-write conflict happens frequently. But in Skywalking, reading operation happens every 3 seconds. Read-write conflict happens rarely in this time period. So I'm not sure if it's necessary to change code.","closed","enhancement,","andyzzl","2021-01-06T02:32:13Z","2021-01-08T02:18:49Z"

I installed the latest istio 1.9.1 version, opened envoyAccessLogService.address=skywalking-oap.istio-system:11800, and deployed istio's bookinfo program. At the same time, the following command was executed to install version 8.1.0 of skywalking: ``` git clone https://github.com/apache/skywalking-kubernetes.git  cd skywalking-kubernetes/chart  helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co  helm dep up skywalking  helm install 8.1.0 skywalking -n istio-system \   --set oap.env.SW_ENVOY_METRIC_ALS_HTTP_ANALYSIS=k8s-mesh \   --set fullnameOverride=skywalking \   --set oap.envoy.als.enabled=true \   --set ui.image.tag=8.1.0 \   --set oap.image.tag=8.1.0-es6 \   --set oap.storageType=elasticsearch` ```  After the pods are started, the bookinfo ui through the gateway is normal, but there is no information when accessing the skywalking-ui. I checked the oap log and found the following error:  ``` 2021-03-08 08:04:12,286 - org.elasticsearch.client.RestClient -47898 [I/O dispatcher 1] WARN  [] - request [HEAD http://elasticsearch-master:9200/_template/instance_jvm_thread_peak_count] returned 1 warnings: [299 Elasticsearch-6.8.6-3d9f765 ""[types removal] The parameter include_type_name should be explicitly specified in get template requests to prepare for 7.0.

"","5980","[Core] Add new concept, EVENT","Hi SkyWalking team  I have been thinking about this concept for a long time, I am going to officially propose this concept now. Right now, we have tracing and metrics fully supported, logging is on the way due to the browser provided and satellite is going to do more in this field. We have the typical 3 concepts, logging/tracing/metrics, in the observability. But in the real world, it is more complex than those 3. **EVENT** is one of the most typical things.   System performance could be changed due to different variables, such as upgrading, rebooting, chaos testing, hosted VM overload. Some of them are detectable in some tools, such as rebooting in k8s, upgrading in CI/CD pipeline. But at the same time, they are only accessible through agent tech. We call this the event.  **Event** should include owner(affected instance/service/etc.) with time range(start/end). This would be easy to implement in OAP as actually, it is a new kind of record only. The major difference is, one event would include 2 records, typically, one for the start, the other for ending, linked by an UUID. Because an event could take a long time, 2 records could make the event started shows up ASAP.  - gRPC/HTTP interface should be provided to report events. CLI should follow this to give a command to report events too. - GraphQL interface should be provided for UI to visualize the event.  As a special request to UI, @Fine0830  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/101591380-67877c00-3a27-11eb-9719-89f4ba135727.png) We need to add a timeline based on the selected time range, showing the event dot(if even hasn't stopped), or a bar(covering start to end timestamp). When the mouse clicks the dot or bar, all charts(if in the dashboard), should show a vertical line(or range) to highlight the metrics values at this special time points.","closed","core feature,","wu-sheng","2020-12-09T06:07:14Z","2021-04-06T06:49:25Z"

"","6219","[Discuss] Response to Elastic 2021 License Change","Hi Community,  Elastic announced they are changing the license of ElasticSearch server recently, from Apache 2.0 to SSPL. Official announcement is here, https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing SSPL has been confirmed as a Catalog X LICENSE. So we can't only focus on it anymore. We need to consider other storage options. Right now, we still have InfluxDB, TiDB, H2 server still in Apache 2.0 licensed.  As one optional plugin, we need to focus on the client driver license. Right now, we are only using ElasticSearch 7.5.0 and 6.3.2 drivers, which are both Apache 2.0 licensed. So, we are safe. For further upgrade, here is their announcement.  ``` Many of our products and projects continue to be under Apache 2.0, including our client libraries ``` ``` > I'm using Elasticsearch via APIs, how does this change affect me? This change does not affect how you use client libraries to access Elasticsearch. Our client libraries remain licensed under  Apache 2.0, with the exception of our Java High Level Rest Client (Java HLRC).  The Java HLRC has dependencies on the core of Elasticsearch, and as a result this client library will be licensed under the  Elastic License. Over time, we will eliminate this dependency and move the Java HLRC to be licensed under Apache 2.0. Until  that time, for the avoidance of doubt, we do not consider using the Java HLRC as a client library in development of an  application or library used to access Elasticsearch to constitute a derivative work under the Elastic License, and this will not  have any impact on how you license the source code of your application using this client library or how you distribute it. ```  **The only impact to us is**, if we move on to support the 8.x or upgrade the driver to 7.11+(include 7.11), we have to wait for their latest Apache 2.0 licensed driver.  ___  Besides the potential risk of ElasticSearch's company behaviors, we need to consider other more general available database solution. There are several in my mind. 1. Apache Cassandra, https://cassandra.apache.org/. cc @michaelsembwever  2. Apache Solr, https://lucene.apache.org/solr/. Sub-project of Lucene, which is the core of ElasticSearch too. cc @dmsolr  3. Apache IoTDB, https://iotdb.apache.org/. cc @jixuan1989 4. Hybrid, M3 https://m3db.io/, focuses on metrics, Cassandra or something focuses on the trace/log.  Besides above, I was having long discussion with @hanahmily, we should have plan to build SkyWalking own storage solution, focusing on metrics/log/trace observability area data, without bothering about the transaction and consistency of most database provided. We should be able to delivery a higher performance, lower resource cost hybrid database solution as a new sub project under SkyWalking's umbrella.

Like we did in the backend side, the configurations should be separated from the the initial agent.config definition. The implementation decides whether they support the configuration dynamically changes.  From my preference, we may need a new gRPC service for the agent for dynamic configuration. Note, we need a ID(UUID or timestamp) to represent the configuration to avoid responding the configuration to the agent repeatedly.

OAL introduced in 6.x and is enhanced w/ time to support language-agent tracer and service mesh telemetry analysis to get metrics. 2. MAL introduced in 8.2 and 8.3 to adopt the native and 3rd party meter system, including Prometheus, MicroMeter, Zabbix(WIP)  With the incoming 8.4.0 release, we have logging collection, persistent, and query capability. Now, we should focus on enhancing the analysis feature. That is where LAL stands on. The LAL should be able to provide the following features. 1. It should be defined in the config file, like OAL script, and MAL YAML. It is usable by the end users. 2. Support structure unify log data content. Especially for TEXT format log. Should be able to convert it to the JSON, or something for further process. 3. Support TEXT, YAML, JSON formats 4. Filter logs based on conditions 5. Build new meter(metrics) based on the match conditions of structured log. Such as, you could set a business error metrics if there is a specific text(`xyz fails`) detected in the logs. 6. Build collaboration with trace context. Such as isolate text(trace_id) from the text by using some split/regex mechanism. 7. Entity assignment mechanism. Build the connection between entity(service/instance/endpoint) with the log contents.  From the tech perspective, this could reference from the MAL tech stack.

"","6411","[Core Feature] Merge metrics indexes of ElasticSearch based on MetricsFunction/MeterFunction annotation","Hi  This is a core feature/improvement proposal. Currently, this is a theoretically solution.  ## Background SkyWalking today has a huge extendibility in log/metric/trace analysis. So, many metrics are being or will be added, rather than the old days, we rely on the trace analysis mostly. Then, right now, every metric of SkyWalking generated logically maps to one index of ElasticSearch. Even we have merged day and hour level into minute, and provided dayStep to reduce the number of indexes. Still, the number is huge, and most importantly, it is increasing. Also, at the same time, the size of metric index is much less than the segments, such as ``` skywalking-online_service_cpm-20210213                                 FB8Yym7aTDqgAgpYJrG_NQ  1 1    941083    2612 191.8mb  95.8mb  skywalking-online_endpoint_cpm-20210130                                V8SZg-1qSO6mhvA0m7cs9A  1 1   8777005   36984   3.5gb   1.7gb skywalking-online_service_instance_relation_client_cpm-20210123        Qb-cxpTGS7-Qpz02n1T8LQ  1 1  95699175  563518  60.1gb    30gb skywalking-online_segment-20210218                                     5aOr9YGeTq2_xfOPypCQUQ 30 0 353400759       0 389.3gb 389.3gb ```  ## Proposal If we merge `service_cpm`, `endpoint_cpm` and `service_instance_relation_client_cpm` into an index, let's call it, `cpm-*`, the performance impact of query is very limited, because basically the size of data set still ~30GB(60GB because of one replication).  To separate these metrics for the SkyWalking query, we need to add metric name in the `ROWID` and as a separated column, which is also not a big issue. The only side-effect is causing 10-20 chars as ROWID. Then, consider this grouping mechanism is 100% automatically, so users would feel confused.  At last, speaking from ElasticSearch storage perspective, as the metric/metric function sharing, most columns are still same. But as we need `StorageEsInstaller#createMapping`, we need the unison set for all possible columns of all metrics in one kind. In the previous case, endpoint_cpm has one or two more columns.

And back to many discussion in the past several years, there is no chance to support Zipkin trace analysis in a perfect way. So I am going to propose this 1.

Adjust #5835 to adopt this as the lastest naming rule.  1. Update UI's template page. `Service Filter` should be renamed to `Service Group`(including the Chinese version) 1. Update the self-observability dashboard configuration(maybe codes too).  # Service Auto Grouping SkyWalking supports various default and customized dashboard templates.  Each template provides the reasonable layout for the services in the particular field.  Such as, services with a language agent installed  could have different metrics with service detected by the service mesh observability solution,  and different with SkyWalking's self-observability metrics dashboard.  Therefore, since 8.3.0, SkyWalking OAP would generate the group based on this simple naming format.  ### ${service name} = [${group name}:]${logic name}  Once the service name includes `:`(colon), the literal string before the colon would be considered as the group name. In the latest GraphQL query, the group name has been provided as an option parameter. > getAllServices(duration: Duration!, group: String): [Service!]!  RocketBot UI dashboards(`Standard` type) support the `group name` for default and custom configurations.  ___  FYI @hailin0 I think you need to consider this in your DolphinScheduler integration.

Closes #. - [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).  The sidecar is a common concept today, as the service mesh has been the next-generation infrastructure, no matter in k8s or out. I found we need to support this in the mesh telemetry internal format to support defining metrics in the mesh case. There are 2 major changes in the PR 1. Nested classes definition is not supported in the previous OAL core, so I added them. It should support any nested class. 2. Support `sideCar.internalErrorCode` in the Service, ServiceInstance, Endpoint, ServiceRelation, and ServiceInstanceRelation sources, then you could have OAL scripts like this  ``` service_cpm_sidecar = from(Service.*).filter(sideCar.internalErrorCode != """").cpm(); service_sla_sidecar = from(Service.*).percent(sideCar.internalErrorCode != """"); ```  The current Istio+Envoy mesh telemetry's `sideCar.internalErrorCode` is mapping to envoy's v2 ALS definition, https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/data/accesslog/v2/accesslog.proto#data-accesslog-v2-responseflags.  At last, I didn't change anything in the default OAL, all these two features are open to the users. If they want to this, they could add new OAL scripts, and set up the UI.","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2020-11-16T09:16:56Z","2020-11-17T01:03:53Z"

Closes #. - [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).  In the SWCK 0.2.0, we intend to add supports for k8s HPA. So, I expose the metrics metadata list query service by the GraphQL to adopt the HPA requirement.  In this query 1. You could query all metrics when put `regex=`. 1. Use any regex to filter all available metrics by name.  In the response, we provide the name, type, catalog of all metrics. Here is the response for my local test ```graphql {   listMetrics(regex: ""service.*"") {   	name,     type,     catalog   } } ```  ```graphql {   ""data"": {     ""listMetrics"": [       {         ""name"": ""service_cpm"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_server_resp_time"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_server_percentile"",         ""type"": ""LABELED_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_client_resp_time"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_apdex"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_client_percentile"",         ""type"": ""LABELED_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_client_cpm"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_server_cpm"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_cpm"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_percentile"",         ""type"": ""LABELED_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_client_percentile"",         ""type"": ""LABELED_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_sla"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_client_cpm"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_server_resp_time"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_resp_time"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_sla"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_resp_time"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_client_resp_time"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_server_call_sla"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_server_percentile"",         ""type"": ""LABELED_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_client_call_sla"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_server_call_sla"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_relation_server_cpm"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_RELATION""       },       {         ""name"": ""service_instance_relation_client_call_sla"",         ""type"": ""REGULAR_VALUE"",         ""catalog"": ""SERVICE_INSTANCE_RELATION""       }     ]   } } ```","closed","feature,","wu-sheng","2020-11-19T12:53:36Z","2020-11-19T14:26:59Z"

The reason I am doing this is because, the log feature is closing ready. You can see the progress from https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5930, we are waiting for the last piece from UI side only, we have gRPC reporter for log4j/log4j2/logback, w/ or w/o Satellite, and OAP backend supports.  You also could see from https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/pull/420, @Fine0830 is supporting the log-trace collaboration in the UI too.  As this new implementation doesn't require to wait for the segment finish signal, it will cost less memory, and local Satellite could provide file cache mechanism(@EvanLjp leads that project). We should recommend users to take the latest and more powerful solution.  At last, I am sorry we are removing an accepted contribution which is never released.

Closes #. - [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).  For example, the metrics data as below: ``` samples=[ Sample(name=null, labels={idc=t1}, value=50.0, timestamp=0),  Sample(name=null, labels={idc=t3, region=cn, svc=catalog}, value=51.0, timestamp=0), Sample(name=null, labels={idc=t1, region=us, svc=product}, value=50.0, timestamp=0),  Sample(name=null, labels={idc=t1, region=us, instance=10.0.0.1}, value=100.0, timestamp=0),  Sample(name=null, labels={idc=t3, region=cn, instance=10.0.0.1}, value=3.0, timestamp=0) ] ``` The rule is `http_success_request.sum(['idc']).service(['idc'])`  As before， MAL would match the label `idc` value `t1` as the `serviceName` set to `MeterEntity` from the **first** sample. Obviously it‘s lost `t3` as another `serviceName` and `MeterEntity`. MAL can't support this scenario unless all samples label `idc` value are `t1`.  After this PR,  MAL would group the samples by scope labels, mapping the grouped samples to different `MeterEntity`. More scenario can see the testcase code in `ScopeTest.java`","closed","enhancement,","wankai123","2021-03-05T09:42:03Z","2021-03-17T01:47:15Z"

Dubbo Version: 2.7.5 Skywalking Version: 8.3.0  My Java app ran into an endless FullGC state some days before. After some analysis, I found this. When Dubbo RPC Chain acts like: A-->dubbo://B-->dubbo://C, and in some situation server C slow down or suddenly crush, Dubbo-thread(Provider) on Server B may triggers an 'Consumer is shutting down' Exception, org.apache.dubbo.rpc.AsyncRpcResult.getAppResponse won't get any result(dubbo code notes: '// This should not happen in normal request process;'). Then result.getException in afterMethod throws exception in Skywalking java agent as below(won't log into span.log):  > ERROR 2021-01-27 15:06:19:290 Dubbo-thread-388 InstMethodsInter : class[class org.apache.dubbo.monitor.support.MonitorFilter] after method[invoke] intercept failure > org.apache.dubbo.rpc.RpcException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Consumer is shutting down and this call is going to be stopped without receiving any result, usually this is called by a slow provider instance or bad service implementation.   >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.AsyncRpcResult.getAppResponse(AsyncRpcResult.java:148)   >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.AsyncRpcResult.getException(AsyncRpcResult.java:107)   >    at org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.asf.dubbo.DubboInterceptor.afterMethod(DubboInterceptor.java:110)   >    at org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.interceptor.enhance.InstMethodsInter.intercept(InstMethodsInter.java:97)   >    at org.apache.dubbo.monitor.support.MonitorFilter.invoke(MonitorFilter.java)   >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.ProtocolFilterWrapper$1.invoke(ProtocolFilterWrapper.java:81)   >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.dubbo.filter.FutureFilter.invoke(FutureFilter.java:49)   >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.ProtocolFilterWrapper$1.invoke(ProtocolFilterWrapper.java:81)  StopSpan() won't work, TraceSegment will be kept by ThreadLocal when dubbo runs in threadpool mode. While this thread creating new entryspans later, the old TraceSegment will be added into refs.(memory leak)  This is a JVM heapdump after the memory leak happened for several days(the thread is holding 768332 spans): ![mat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8132268/108948485-8a781280-769d-11eb-97ea-5121996ec2fa.png)  I thinks maybe there are some 'unnormal' RpcExceptions which can't be obtained by result.getException(). Perhaps we could catch them when calling it from afterMethod.

Shared with `kafka`. - [x] Add a logo in [the UI repo](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/tree/master/src/views/components/topology/assets). Shared with `kafka`.  - [x] As a continuation of #5244 - [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md)  ### The current design of Spring-Kafka plugin  The current `Spring-Kafka` plugin in skywalking is aimed at `Spring-Kafka 2.x+` in the sense that there is a `pollAndInvoke` method which is responsible for `poll` messages from Kafka and `invoke` the listeners defined by developers. And this method is provided from version 2.2.1 in order to improve the smell of the codes https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka/pull/873  So the current plugin takes advantage of this refactor and enhances directly this `pollAndInvoke` method. But we still have to maintain many services which depend on Spring-Boot 1.5.x and thus `Spring-Kafka` 1.3.x according to [the official compatibility matrix](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka).  ### The approach to versions below 2.2.x  Below that specific version, we do not have `pollAndInvoke` method and this whole function is **inlined** into the `while`-loop of the main `run` method, thus seems not possible to make this enhancement. My approach is to enhance the `processSeeks` in the same inner class `ListenerConsumer`. The reason why we choose this aspect is,  - this method is called at the very beginning of the loop (or equivalently the end of the loop), then we can inject(remove) our `Context` after(before) the method is executed. - this method is called and **only** called there, it is not used in other places, which represents precisely the beginning of the run loop.  For completeness and safe reasons, we also enhance the whole `run()` method in order to remove the context after the loop finishes.  The last thing is to distinguish the versions of `Spring-Kafka`. I use `org.springframework.kafka.listener.config.ContainerProperties` as the witness class for versions below `2.2.x`. This class is renamed as `org.springframework.kafka.listener.ContainerProperties` after `2.2.x`. So this plugin will not be applied for Spring-Kafka 2.2.x+. I have checked all versions up to `2.6.x`.  So with this plugin, we can enhance the following `Spring-Kafka` versions, which are missing so far,  - 1.3.x - 2.0.x - 2.1.x  Theoretically, it can also work with 1.2.x, but that version is not recommended by the official Spring-Kafka team.

For example , all of T4CPreparedStatement, OraclePreparedStatementWrapper and OraclePreparedStatement have setString method. If we create a InterceptPoint for setString, all of these 3 classes can be intercepted, but only OraclePreparedStatementWrapper(Outside invocation) have connection info and StatementEnhanceInfo. Hence, sometimes when ojdbc invoke executeQuery method with setMethod for SQL parameters, setMethod of OraclePreparedStatementWrapper runs well , but both  T4CPreparedStatement and OraclePreparedStatement  would get a NullPoniterException. We can find it in agent log. To aviod this issue in a easy way , we can try to add a null-conditional operator for statementEnhanceInfos, to prevent the null object invoke setParameter(index, parameter);  - [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works. - [x] Explain briefly about why the bug exists and how to fix it.         - [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.
