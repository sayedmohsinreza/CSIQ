We are proposing to leverage a new OAP `starter` module, which could use maven exclude to get rid of existing ES6 storage plugin and ES6 client lib, then we could create new modules. The new structure will look like this  ``` + oap-server    + server-starter-es7[new]        pom.xml(depend on server starter, exclude storage-elasticsearch-plugin)    + server-storage-plugin        + storage-elasticsearch7-plugin[new] ```  Also, of course, we need some changes in the dist folder, to include the new package, but basically that is OK.

"","4599","Make 8.0.0 Core available. New protocol and register removed.","This would be a huge pull request, relating to **protocol**, agent and backend. 8.x would be an new core without back forward compatibility. After the experiences of removing endpoint_inventory, I found out this strategy is successful. Especially, we totally get rid of register, so I want to do more.  *SkyWalking 8.0.0* First, it is already unexpected for me, we have to move to 8.0.0 so quickly, but after the discussion with @hanahmily , and thinking about this for several days, I think we have to.  The key chances are following 1. Remove service, service instance, and network address register. The old register protocols are totally going to be removed. 2. The agent doesn't need to do register anymore. Service name and Service Instance name are generated by the agent itself, but the extra information, such as IP, hostname, language, should report to backend separately. 3. Service Traffic should be added just like the endpoint traffic but keep the time bucket as we need accurate service name in the given duration 4. Service Instance Traffic should be added too, with external information, such as language, hostname. 5. Trace context propagation context should be changed to accept string in service instance name, endpoint name and network address. This could ease the agent logic, but also, requires changes in all language agent and plugin test tool, 6. Trace report protocol requires to change too, in order to adopt the string. 7. e2e tests have to ignore PHP and LUA at first, and remove the 6.x compatibility test(doesn't support anymore).  The benefits we will get are 1. Don't worry about the inventory(s) that has been deleted randomly by end users. (We received a lot of issue reports about this) 2. The upgrade could be easier erasing the whole storage and reboot the new one. (Users don't feel comfortable about upgrade) 3. No hot-reboot case in the agent side 4. No cache of network address register information in the agent. 5. No service and service instance cache in the OAP 6. No register lock in the OAP 7. No file buffer mechanism in the OAP too, same as no register happens.  In my mind, I think this totally break upgrade is super meaningful and will be good change. Even we break many things, they are easy to follow. @mrproliu  I think by following this, we need to change the collaboration header to `sw8` :) As no 7.1.0 release will happen.

You don't need to use Language based native agent and Service Mesh probe at the same time, because they both collect metrics data. As a result of that, your system suffers twice payloads, and the analytic numbers are doubled. 2. Use Service Mesh probe with Language based native agent or 3rd-party instrument library in tracing status. (Advanced usage)  I'm confused by the description above,How to properly use native probe in service mesh?

I'd like to monitor my Liferay Portal CE 7.2 GA1 instance with Apache SkyWalking 6.5.0. Liferay is a Java CMS. On that DEV environment following software is installed: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS, OpenJDK 11.0.4, Apache Tomcat 9.0.17 and MariaDB 10.1.41 as Liferay storage.  In than configuration the MariaDB database is not recognized by SkyWalking completely.  On a different VM with Ubuntu 19.10, Azul Zulu JDK 11.0.5 and MySQL 5.7.28 Skywalking recognizes the DB just fine. On that environment the DB is a different server, on the first one everything is on one machine.  Is that a bug or SkyWalking just doesn't work with MariaDB and it's a missing Feature? Or coud it be a configuration issue? (Config is on both environments is similar).  Thank you.  ___ ### Bug - Which version of SkyWalking, OS and JRE?

deadlock at the following location; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150229/68174185-22894e80-ffb8-11e9-82b2-ac072f942171.png) I think SkyWalking is trying to make all the enhanced classes,  First get the `ReentrantLock INSTANCE_LOAD_LOCK` lock of sw,  Then classload.  But thread 311 destroys this rule, see this code at org.springframework.http.client.HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.(HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.java:67) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150229/68174426-0a65ff00-ffb9-11e9-9cac-aa028aaa876c.png) This first get classload lock, then the `ReentrantLock INSTANCE_LOAD_LOCK` lock of sw.  So, Deadlock in the case of concurrency. Am I right? and how avoid this case","closed","agent,","zhaoyuguang","2019-11-05T02:50:18Z","2019-11-20T01:34:56Z"

I have a Liferay CE (Java CMS) on Apache Tomcat and Apache SkyWalking installed on the same machine. Liferay is configured to work with the ports 8009, 8080 and 8443 and Apache Skywalking is configured to use TCP_8081. Now I would like to manage the web acces over the Apache Webserver and enable authentication for SkyWalking. So I'd like to have the same hostname for both and Liferay should use the root URL location ""/"" and SkyWalking should use something like /skywalking - so:  Liferay:         mywebsite.com SkyWalking: mywebsite.com/skywalking  Unfortunately SkyWalking doesn't work like this. It works only if it is proxied as root (/). My experiments with the Apache Webserver mod_proxy_html weren't successful.  So, now there are two possibilities:  1) Does anybody know how to proxy Apache SkyWalking wit the Apache WebServer under a different endpoint URL?  2) Or is it possible to configure Apache SkyWalking to start under a different endpont URL, like localhost:8081/skywalking? Like this it would be very easy to proxy it.  I would like to not create a separate virtual host in Apache WebServer for this.

"","4020","How should we handle the cross-cloud invocation scenario?","Please answer these questions before submitting your issue.  - Why do you submit this issue? - [x] Question or discussion - [ ] Bug - [ ] Requirement - [ ] Feature or performance improvement  ___ ### Question - What do you want to know?  How should we handle the cross-cloud invocation scenario?  In our business scenario, because of the compliance audit, our core payment services run in Alibaba Finance Cloud, and because of the cost considerations, the pre-payment services run in Alibaba Public Cloud. When we make a payment, the trace is from Public to Finance, when the payment finshed, the trace is from Finance to Public.  Currently, our deployment mode of Skywalking is that Finance and Public each have a integrated Skywalking services, which are responsible for the service tracing in their respective Cloud regions.  As we know, it will be discarded if the tracing is from the other Skywalking, because of the registration mechanism, the registration information of the service across the cloud is not available at the other end.  Therefore, in order to support the cross-cloud invocation, we developed a service named inventory_sync_server to finish registration information sync, and also slightly modified some OAP source code.  The scheme is as follows: 1. Inventory_sync_server was added to monitor the changes of Skywalking registration information, and push the changes to Aliyun RocketMQ.  Meanwhile, the data monitoring service on the other end will subscribe messages via the Internet HTTP Endpoint to register the changes to Skywalking; 2. The data monitoring service is deployed at both ends to synchronize the application registration information in real time, so that the tracing which across the cloud can be processed; 3. This requires slightly modified of the OAP source code to support this approach; 4. Of course, we also made some other enhancements to support our business scenarios, such as:       a. carry the user-defined transactionId of frontend to passthrough to the backend services, so that the frontend and business log and Skywalking will be related. We think this is a very practical function; 	  b. Make sure of the cross-cloud invocation has the same treaceId.  This is our way of dealing with it, we are looking forward to some better solutions.

How to enhance method with @RequestMapping annotation declared in it's interface?  Here is the example code ``` interface RestApi {     @RequestMapping(""/test"")     String test(); }  @RestController public class RestApiImpl implements RestApi {     @Override     public String test() {         return ""test"";     } } ``` The problem is that skywalking can not enhance the `RestApiImpl.test()` method. I guess the reason is skywalking cannot find `@RequestMapping` annotation in overrided method.  And here is the related source code  in sw's spring-plugins: ``` # RequestMappingMethodInterceptor.java public class RequestMappingMethodInterceptor extends AbstractMethodInterceptor {     @Override     public String getRequestURL(Method method) {         String requestURL = """";         RequestMapping methodRequestMapping = method.getAnnotation(RequestMapping.class);         if (methodRequestMapping.value().length > 0) {             requestURL = methodRequestMapping.value()[0];         } else if (methodRequestMapping.path().length > 0) {             requestURL = methodRequestMapping.path()[0];         }         return requestURL;     }   // ... ```  But the method `getAnnotation` can not get annotation from interface, so how can i solve this problem?","closed","plugin,","carrypann","2019-11-13T08:50:40Z","2019-12-20T08:59:59Z"

I am interested in seeing micrometer support, because as an application developer I am interested in making custom metrics in one abstraction layer. For Spring Boot + Java language micrometer is giving me the flexibility to create metrics and then decide later at runtime where the metric needs to go or who it integrates to.  If Skywalking uses agents to gather information, then proposal would be to have an implementation of micrometer `MeterRegistry`[here](https://micrometer.io/docs/guide/customMeterRegistry) to plug into the existing skywalking metrics ingesting capabilities.    That would allow for use cases where in development environment, i can bring up just my micro-service, and automated test my microservice is creating custom metric correctly using a prometheus exporter but in live environments, I turn on skywalking agent and have metrics stream.  _Originally posted by @wu-sheng in https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3053#issuecomment-510691895_","closed","feature,","krmeda","2020-01-23T15:54:50Z","2020-08-06T08:20:02Z"

When i run it in container, i got a empty page:     So i checked the skywalking-ui log, the last line shows no mapping found for [/app.js].

Is it possible to combine hour, day, and month indexes and distinguish them by a type field inside the index, which is expected to reduce the number of indexes by 3/4. Query performance may be partially improved due to the use of fewer shards. But this has not been actually tested.","closed","enhancement,","ghost","2020-01-07T03:33:11Z","2020-09-19T02:43:08Z"

Might look like:  Here is a case where hostname resolution is not assigned  in /etc/hosts,Only the following records:    ```shell ::1     localhost       localhost.localdomain   localhost6      localhost6.localdomain6 127.0.0.1       localhost       localhost.localdomain   localhost4      localhost4.localdomain4 ```  In this case, if there is no default bound device, GetHostName() will reverse resolve the host name 127.0.0.1 to ""localhost"", which is usually not what we expected.  So we may be able to make some improvements and perform a second detection for the case of returning ""localhost"", for example, from the linux kernel information:   ```java // simple demo .When hostname is localhost, check again. public static String getHostName() {     if (HOST_NAME == null) {         try {             InetAddress host = InetAddress.getLocalHost();             HOST_NAME = host.getHostName();         } catch (UnknownHostException e) {             HOST_NAME = ""unknown"";         }     }      if (HOST_NAME == ""localhost""){         try{             HOST_NAME = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(""/proc/sys/kernel/hostname"")), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);         } catch (Exception e) {             HOST_NAME = ""unknown"";         }     }     return HOST_NAME; }  ```    Maybe things will change.

By default Skywalking instruments many plugins that are present in ~/apache-skywalking-apm-bin-es7/agent/plugins directory. In Skywalking v7.0 there are 76 plugin jars available. Not all environments need all of these plugins instrumented.   Proposal is to provide a property configuration via agent.config which can take a file name that can in turn list the plugins needed for an environment. Below elaborates more on specifics of this request  In agent.config, introduce a new property, say ""PluginConfigs"", as shown below …. PluginConfigs=/some-directory/skywalking-plugin.def  and   Let us say I have /some-directory/skywalking-plugin.def as shown below  rabbitmq-5.x=org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.rabbitmq.define.RabbitMQProducerInstrumentation rabbitmq-5.x=org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.rabbitmq.define.RabbitMQConsumerInstrumentation  In this setup, expectation is to just instrument only RabbitMQ consumer and producer although I have agent installed with all 76 plugins.  In summary, new property ""PluginConfigs"" acts a override to current behavior which instruments all plugins available under ""agent/plugin"" directory. And ""PluginConfigs"" property is optional. when ""PluginConfigs"" is not configured, current behavior to instrument all available plugins based on class path can be retained.","closed","question,","viswaramamoorthy","2020-03-26T18:51:02Z","2020-03-27T12:24:23Z"

In some cases, especially when the target java app is packaged in an old way, i mean the depency libs directory is out of the target application jar.  We need to add some VM options to make sure the java applications starts well, like ""java -cp **/lib   -ext.dirs **/lib"" .  But when we add these VM options, the target ClassLoaders may not be able to load any classes from skywalking-agent.jar cause it's out of the path  i have defined previously.  The target app classloader or any of its parent classloader will load the class with failure and push it down to AgentClassLoader to load the class ,and finally ,the not class found exception will stop the application from start. ___ ### Requirement or improvement - Please describe about your requirements or improvement suggestions.  I suggest to add SkyWalking-agent.jar or its dirs to classpath to make the load mechanism compatible with old packaing way instead of spring-boot fat jar.","closed","rejected,","jackiepon31","2019-10-20T09:28:27Z","2021-10-31T13:36:25Z"

The traceId generated by the call is different. however, if the dubbo call timeout and retry, the traceId is the same, because the sw3 parameter of the last call is reused. In this scenario, The effect of multiple dubbo calls and dubbo retry  should be the same.

This PR provides a new storage plugin for OAP which uses two-level storage.   The first level is a relationship database stored something likes `inventory`, which has transactions and updates. Stored in MySQL.(Now, I make H2 as relationship database. Because it is easy for test.)  The second level is a time-series database, stored `metrics`, `logs`, and `traces`. Those data have strong time-lined and no-transaction, no-updated, no-deleted. Stored in InfluxDB.  InfluxDB is a very powerful time-series database. It is good at manipulating time-series data. So, it is suitable for our trace records that have strong time-lined, no-updated, and no-deleted.  Now, it is an experimental feature. We need to continuously improve it with you. And it is a meaningful experience for others NoSQL/TSDB likes Apache Druid, OpenTSDB.  ------------------------------------ ## TODO list - [x] feature - [x] e2e with standone - [x] e2e with cluster - [x] document (backend-storage.md) - [x] e2e-ttl - [x] update license - [x] comments (provided without interface implemented) - [x] docker/docker-entrypoint.sh - [x] refactor e2e-ttl and e2e-influxdb","closed","backend,","dmsolr","2020-01-15T16:20:35Z","2020-04-11T15:35:37Z"

There're some breaking changes in ES7, since we are (and will) still using ES6-java-client, all the efforts are made by lower level REST client of ES.  In this PR, we don't use high level REST client to ES7, which is more convenient and is used in ES6 storage plugin, by using low level client, we can pass some parameters that ES6 doesn't support, such as `if_seq_no`, etc.  Some of the parameters are deprecated in ES7, but according to the upgrade strategy of ES, the deprecated parameters should work at least in all the minor versions under a major version, so there may be warnings in the log, but it does no harm, that's as was expected.  @wu-sheng Although the E2E tests passed (locally, and should be the same in Infra Jenkins), I'll propose to mark this as **Experimental** in the documentation for now, and invite some users to try and if the feedback is positive, we can make it **Stable** in the future version, documentations should be added later after fully discussed.  Anyone who wants to review this PR, please pay special attention to the ES6 storage plugin, this PR should not break the ES6 plugin in any aspect, thanks.","closed","plugin,","kezhenxu94","2019-10-13T16:04:30Z","2019-10-14T17:41:36Z"

We found that when we cut the Oracle URL, we only recognize the URL of one sid connection mode (jdbc: oracle: thin: @ < host >: < port >: < Sid >); so here I added the recognition of the URL of another sidsid connection mode (jdbc: oracle: thin: @ < host >: < port > / < Sid >).  - How to fix?

For inputs, I would like to share a subproject that extends skywalking functions to you.  Background The background is to obtain user behavior and track the use of products in the user side, and to indicate the direction of product optimization based on monitoring data. Generally, the front-end monitoring collection includes exception collection, performance collection and behavior collection.We build skywalking-client-js for this, and it will also extend skywalking. functions.  Structure Collect(skywalking-client-js) ---> Store(skywalking) ---> Analyse(skywalking, skywalking-rocketbot-ui) ---> Alarm(skywalking, skywalking-rocketbot-ui)  Features There are some features for skywalking-client-js, as follow 1. project init and build development environment 2. basic functions, as follow task queue, put errors in this task and delete, then report error to server one by one. handle log, format data report log to server, support two ways report logs to server 3. monitor and record errors to task, errors have several types, as follow monitor resource errors monitor promise errors monitor vue errors monitor react errors monitor javascript errors monitor console errors 4. monitor performance, record time for load, redirect, response, dom ready time, then report to server. 5. monitor device, get some information of OS, browser 6. support e2e tracing from browser side  Finally, We plan to realize them when SkyWalking release 7.0 version.

SkyWalking now supports JDK 6-13 in the agent side for a long time, and is suffering the risk of RPC component bug too. gRPC has given up the supports for JDK6 one year before. Also ref to RedHat OpenJDK maintenance plan[1], OpenJDK6 has not been supported in December 2016. Oracle JDK has similar storay.  I want to initial that, SkyWalking should decide to give up the support on JDK 1.6, and move to higher JDK requirement. The question will be, does JDK 1.7 or 1.8 make more sense?  All people in the dev channel, your responses are super important.  The conclusion will be made soon in the next week.

The trace will be reported and output in the nginx log.   @kezhenxu94 @dmsolr @arugal @aderm Any suggestion about how to do this?

(assigned to @hanahmily )  1. clear docker images.  @wu-sheng @innerpeacez @kezhenxu94  Some issues should be confirmed before we start to do it.   1. ES will deploy several pods with the current Helm chart. That's not accepted in CI. So I suggest creating a new ES template which is only enabled in CI.   1. we don't deploy UI in CI.

"","4570","[Inventory Design Change] Remove endpoint register and endpoint inventory","If you are familiar with the latest OAP core, you will know, we register id for the endpoint. But this design has the following issues 1. The register has low performance as it can't be run in parral even we have clustering OAP. Even worse, in the cluster mode, the register is slower 2. The ID is designed as an integer, it could be run out in some time. We don't have good idea to restore or extend it. 3. Endpoint including the parameter(such as, inside the URI) is always an issue, and could only be improved in the agent plugin, but never could be fixed.  The new changes are 1. Use `EndpointTraffic` to replace `EndpointInventory`. EndpointTraffic is a manual metrics, not a register inventory. 2. ID register would not happen, and service_id + base64(endpoint name) will be used as the entity id. 3. EndpointTraffic also keeps the time series feature like all other metrics, so it could be removed by TTL. 4. EndpointRelation follows the changes of EndpointInevntory removal. It keeps the source-service_id + base64(source endpoint name) and dest-service_id + base64(dest endpoint name).  - The Endpoint_Traffic looks like this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/77605518-17779080-6f50-11ea-88df-de2e6e98e357.png)  - The Endpoint* metrics, such as endpoint_sla.

"","4597","Move to 8.0.0","Hi Dev Team  After the experiences of removing endpoint_inventory, I found out this strategy is successful. Especially, we totally get rid of register, so I want to do more.  ### SkyWalking 8.0.0 First, it is already unexpected for me, we have to move to 8.0.0 so quickly, but after the discussion with @hanahmily, and thinking about this for several days, I think we have to.  #### The key chances are following 1. Remove service, service instance, and network address register. The old register protocols are totally going to be removed. 2. The agent doesn't need to do register anymore. Service name and Service Instance name are generated by the agent itself, but the extra information, such as IP, hostname, language, should report to backend separately. 3. Service Traffic should be added just like the endpoint traffic but keep the time bucket as we need accurate service name in the given duration 4. Service Instance Traffic should be added too, with external information, such as language, hostname. 5. Trace context propagation context should be changed to accept string in service instance name, endpoint name and network address. This could ease the agent logic, but also, requires changes in all language agent and plugin test tool, 6. Trace report protocol requires to change too, in order to adopt the string. 7. e2e tests have to ignore PHP and LUA at first, and remove the 6.x compatibility test(doesn't support anymore). @heyanlong @moonming @dmsolr   #### The benefits we will get are 1. Don't worry about the inventory(s) that has been deleted randomly by end users. (We received a lot of issue reports about this) 2. The upgrade could be easier erasing the whole storage and reboot the new one. (Users don't feel comfortable about upgrade) 3. No hot-reboot case in the agent side 4. No cache of network address register information in the agent. 5. No service and service instance cache in the OAP 6. No register lock in the OAP 7.

This is her response. ``` I noticed that the only news sent to announce@apache.org was my press release in Aprill 2019 for your graduation as a TLP.  So what I would first do is start announcing your releases on announce@apache.org --this is the list for official news from the ASF, Apache projects, and their communities. I suggest that you take a look at some of the project posts to get an idea of what this looks like https://lists.apache.org/list.html?announce@apache.org  Here's what you need to do to ensure that your email gets moderated through:   - use your @apache.org address  - send your email as *plaintext*  - include [ANNOUNCE] or [ANN] in the subject line  - clearly state the topic in the subject line  - include a short description of what Apache SkyWalking is  - include a link to the project  - include a link to the download(s)  - include a link to a changelog or any additional documentation if available  - sign off on behalf of the project  Apache Tomcat usually has good announcements if you'd like to use them as a model.  All project announcements that are sent to announce@ are included in the Apache Weekly News Round-Ups. These are sent to our media/analyst community. Many journalists use the Round-ups for their news stories and updates. Many Apache projects get regular coverage in InfoWorld, SD Times, The New Stack, TechTarget, and more.  Another thing we can do together is write a ""Have you met?"" feature on Apache Skywalking. Here is an example of what this looks like https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-asf-asks-have-you  What we can do is point to the your article from the ""Have you met?"" writeup.   No doubt you are aware that most everything has slowed down due to COVID-19. Let's do our best over the next few weeks. ```  We keep missing the official announcement channel, and we should fix the process ASAP in the all subprojects. Please review and forward the changes to all sub projects.","closed","high priority,","wu-sheng","2020-03-23T06:58:19Z","2020-03-23T07:54:29Z"

"","4364","Support Downsampling Data Packing feature in ES storage implementation","### Downsampling Data Packing  Downsampling data packing(`storage/elasticsearch/enablePackedDownsampling`, default activated) is a new feature since 7.0.0.   Metrics data has 4 different precisions, based on `core/default/downsampling` configurations.  In previous(6.x), every precision of each metrics had one separated index. After this is activated, metrics of day and hour precisions are merged into minute precision. The number of indexes decreased, and cause less payload to the ElasticSearch server.  ### The new data format preview ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/74588754-425df300-503a-11ea-937c-b205fcc734a7.png) After enabling this feature, 3 precisions of metrics data are all existing in one index(minute precision).  ### Why query could keep in the same. From my understanding, once query could use the right name(merged index name), as they are using different timestamp format(because of precision, length is different), they will exclude other precision data automatically. So no change is required.  ____ To all @apache/skywalking-committers  This PR has a small(18 files only) change set, but influenced scope is large. And this doesn't have the side-effect, so I active it by default. Please review and give me some feedback.","closed","enhancement,","wu-sheng","2020-02-15T13:35:04Z","2020-02-17T02:42:13Z"
"","4368","Support Daily Index Step feature in the OAP","### Daily Index Step Daily index step(`storage/elasticsearch/dayStep`, default 1) represents the index creation period. In this period, several days(dayStep value)' metrics are saved.  Mostly, users don't need to change the value manually. As SkyWalking is designed to observe large scale distributed system. But in some specific cases, users want to set a long TTL value, such as more than 60 days, but their ElasticSearch cluster isn't powerful due to the low traffic in the production environment. This value could be increased to 5(or more), if users could make sure single one index could support these days(5 in this case) metrics and traces.  Such as, if dayStep == 11,  1. data in [2000-01-01, 2000-01-11] will be merged into the index-20000101. 1. data in [2000-01-12, 2000-01-22] will be merged into the index-20000112.  NOTICE, TTL deletion would be affected by these. You should set an extra more dayStep in your TTL. Such as you want to TTL == 30 days and dayStep == 10, you actually need to set TTL = 40;  ### Data in the storage The data in the dayStep period are merged into one index. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/74601432-5c9ade00-50d9-11ea-8e9a-93455cd26cee.png)","closed","backend,","wu-sheng","2020-02-16T08:29:01Z","2020-02-16T12:49:04Z"

"","4282","Collector base on async stack","## Theme This issue discusses async segment collectors.  ## Problem I found there is bad throughput about OAP server collect tracing. I have tried to use skywalking in my production env, but there are too many segments to collect. And I scale the OAP server to 8c16gx8 instances, there are also too many errors about collecting(gRPC client canceled.) The CPU looks fine about OAP server and ES server.  Maybe separate collectors from OAP server is a good idea? Agents are not calling OAP server to collect spans directly, use the MessageQueue or log collector to do it, and make collectors consume those messages or log, one collector maybe 1c2g/2c4g, we can have many collectors with low cost.  ## Opinion I can enumerate many advantages of it.  01. Improve the performance of agents Agents do not need the result from collectors, they just write and write again. 02. Elastic scale OAP server is heavy and expensive, it at least needs 4c8g. But one collector just needs 1c2g or smaller, because it just needs to handle one segment at a time. 03. Delay for stability and safety When collectors can't support agents, the message queue will keep the data, it will not cause data loss, just some delay. 04. Throughput base on collector numbers If you have more collectors, you will have more message throughput. 05. Maybe more lightweight language Collectors can be written in more lightweight language like golang.","closed","discussion,","devkanro","2020-01-28T09:11:39Z","2020-02-03T12:33:36Z"

Using the `helm template`, we should store it in CI for debugging. 1. After apply YAML, we should use `kubectl wait` to wait for all of the pods in istio-system up.  ## Step2 Deploy OAP and UI 1. Add `https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/setup/istio/yaml/skywalkingadapter.yml` in the helm template folder. And parameterize some items, for example, namespace, OAP endpoint, etc... 1. generate template file with `helm template`, then apply it to `istio-system`. 1. issue `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/1.3.3/mixer/template/metric/template.yaml` to apply mixer metric template, which is the bridge between mixer and OAP. 1. wait for all pods up.  ## Step3 Deploy Booinfo sample application  Deploy bookinfo according to https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/.

"","4165","Add kotlin coroutine plugin","# Skywalking with Kotlin coroutine This PR provided an auto instrument support plugin for Kotlin coroutine based on context snapshot.  ## Checklist You can merge this PR after all check is done. - [x] Implementation - [x] Test - [x] Documents - [x] CI build pass - [x] Review  ## Description We have known there are some limits with skywalking and coroutine, because of the trace context based on `ThreadLocal`.  But skywalking provided context snapshot for cross-thread tracing, I create this plugin for resolving context losing in Kotlin coroutine.  ## Implementation principle As we know, Kotlin coroutine switches the execution thread by `CoroutineDispatcher`.  01. Create a snapshot of the current context before dispatch the continuation. 02. Then create a coroutine span after thread switched, mark the span continued with the snapshot. 03. Every new span which created in the new thread will be a child of this coroutine span. So we can link those span together in a tracing. 04. After the original runnable executed, we need to stop the coroutine span for cleaning thread state.  ## Some screenshots ### Run without the plugin We run a Kotlin coroutine based gRPC server without this coroutine plugin.   You can find, the one call (client -> server1 -> server2) has been split two tracing paths.  01. Server1 without exit span and server2 tracing path. ![Without kotlin plugin1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9367842/71715581-dd18be80-2e4c-11ea-9316-60937ee2c03d.jpg) 02.

"","4209","Optimize trace ignore plugin","# Skywalking with fast ignore This PR enhances the trace ignore plugin of Skywalking.   It makes that plugin faster and lightweight.  ## Checklist This PR still in WIP state, you can merge this PR after all check is done. - [x] Implementation - [x] Test - [ ] Documents - [x] CI build pass - [x] Review  ## Description The original trace ignore plugin has bad performance and memory usage.    I optimized it at those points: 01. The `FastPathMatcher` provided pattern matching without any new object created. Space complexity: **O(1)** 02. The `FastPathMatcher` uses the `Depth-first search` algorithm for pattern matching.  Worst time complexity: **O(MN)** Best time complexity: **O(M)** (M: the String size, N: the Pattern size) 03. We split the configs in initializing code, not every `createTraceContext` method.  ## Benchmark This PR improves the performance of the matcher from `475767.318 ± 1507.989 ops/s` to `3921231.220 ± 15153.711 ops/s`.

"","4177","Enhance gRPC plugin","# Skywalking with enhanced gRPC This PR enhances the original gRPC plugin of Skywalking.   I created PR early for the request for comments. @GuoDuanLZ and I will accept opinion and improve this PR.  ## Checklist This PR still in WIP state, you can merge this PR after all check is done. - [x] Implementation - [x] Test - [x] Documents - [x] CI build pass - [ ] Review  ## Description The original gRPC plugin just provided very basically tracing function, the exception of business code will not be traced.  We refactored this plugin for those functions: 01. Server and Client tracing has the same operations. 02. Provide the internal or external gRPC server tracing mode. 03. Streamline span timeline. 04. The error caused by business code will make the ""/Response/onClose"" fail. 05. Reduce interface point and optimize the code.  ## Operations The operation name of that this plugin created will be like ```        service  traceSide             event         ----┘      -----┘         --------┘ foo.bar.MyApi.echo/server/Request/onMessage ------┐       ---┐        ------┐ package      method        side  ``` There are two sides of tracing for gRPC: `client-side` and `server-side`.    Trace side provides a view for gRPC request, it means what the gRPC request looks like in the client or the server.    There are five combinations for sides and events. ``` /Request/onMessage # Request message received on the server or sent on the client.  /Request/onComplete # Client has completed request sending, there is no more incoming request.  /Request/onCancel # Client has canceled the call.  /Response/onMessage # Response message received on client or sent on server.  /Response/onClose # Call closed with status and trailers. ```   For simplifying tracing span, this plugin just creates `onMessage` spans for streaming calls.   - For unary calls, no `onMessage` span created.   - For client-streaming calls, just `/Request/onMessage` span created.   - For server-streaming calls, just `/Response/onMessage` span created.   - For bi-streaming calls, all `/onMessage` span created.    For example: ``` foo.bar.MyApi.echo/server/Request/onMessage # means it is a server-side tracing for server receive a request message from the client.  foo.bar.MyApi.echo/client/Request/onMessage # means it is a client-side tracing for client send a request message to server.  foo.bar.MyApi.echo/server/Response/onMessage # means server send a response message to client.  foo.bar.MyApi.echo/server/Response/onClose # means server completed all handling for a request. ```  ### Internal and external gRPC server tracing If you have two gRPC servers called `Server1` and `Server2`, `Server1` will call the `Server2.test` method in your business code, we just need the `server-side` tracing because of the `Server2` is an internal server, `Server2` will provide `server-side` view, `server-side` view will be more useful for tracing a call than `client-side` view.  If `Server2` is an external gRPC server which you can't get `server-side` view by it. You will need the `Server1` `client-side` view for the call.  ## Configure plugin This plugin provides three configs for configuring internal and external gRPC servers.  ```Java /**  * If this config is false, only client spans of peer which configured in INCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS  * will be collected. In this mode EXCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS will override INCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS.  *   * If this config is true, only client spans of peer which configured in EXCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS  * will not be collected. In this mode INCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS will override EXCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS.  */ public static boolean DEFAULT_CLIENT_TRACING_ENABLE = false;  /**  * Included client tracing peers. gRPC plugin will collect client spans of configured config.  */ public static List INCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS = new LinkedList();  /**  * Excluded client tracing peers. gRPC plugin will not collect client spans of configured config.  */ public static List EXCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS = new LinkedList(); ```  Default config is no external gRPC server, no `client-side` spans created. If you need the `client-side` view for three-part APIs, add the host and port like `services.googleapis.com:11800` into `INCLUDED_CLIENT_TRACING_PEERS`.  ## Screenshots WIP","closed","enhancement,","devkanro","2020-01-05T20:17:42Z","2020-01-30T12:12:49Z"
